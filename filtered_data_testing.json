Binge-watching frequency and motives explain problematic viewing behaviors. However, binge-watching is not a problematic behavior per se. Frequently bingeing can promote problematic viewing habits. Recreational motifs for binge-watching attenuate indicators for problematic viewing. While social interaction, learning, escapism, loneliness, and stimulation promote them. We hope this is possible. The latter interact with the frequency of use in nurturing the development of problematic habits. This study investigates the circumstances under which binge-watching can become a problematic behavior. Applying a user-centered perspective, it demonstrates how different motivations to engage in high-dosage TV series consumption influence the occurrence of problematic viewing habits. A quantitative online survey of N =\u00a0415 media users with access to at least one streaming service was conducted. The questionnaire assessed current viewing habits, motivations to watch series, and indicators of problematic viewing habits. The results suggest that frequency of use, motives to engage in high dosage viewing sessions, as well as the combined effect of these two factors help to explain problematic viewing behaviors. Moreover, the results give cause to refrain from a generalizing problematization of binge-watching.",

    "abstract": "The breastfeeding intention\u2013behaviour gap remains wide in developed countries. Current studies have focused on maternal attitudes and behaviours concerning infant feeding in order to explore barriers to breastfeeding continuation. There has been limited consideration of the impact of paternal attitudes and behaviours, despite contemporary parenthood evolving and evidence indicating that there are greater levels of paternal involvement in routine childcare tasks. This mixed\u2010methods study used a triangulation design to examine the associations between paternal attitudes towards parenthood and infant\u2010feeding methods, levels of paternal involvement, infant\u2010feeding outcomes, and father\u2013infant relationships. Fathers of infants <52\u00a0weeks completed an online survey providing quantitative data ( N =\u00a0212) and qualitative data ( N =\u00a0208). For the quantitative data, fathers completed validated measures about their attitude towards parenthood and infant feeding, levels of paternal involvement, and infant\u2010feeding history. For the qualitative data, questions explored influences on paternal attitudes towards infant feeding and the father\u2013infant relationship. After controlling for covariates, regression analyses found egalitarian attitudes towards parenthood were positively associated with both attitudes towards breastfeeding and levels of paternal involvement. Positive paternal attitudes towards breastfeeding were significantly associated with increased likelihood of breastfeeding. A thematic framework analysis indicated fathers' attitudes towards infant feeding were largely influenced by their families and partners or healthcare professionals. Polarised views were expressed about the impact infant\u2010feeding methods had on the father\u2013infant relationship, although fathers were united in their desire to bond with their infant. Addressing paternal attitudes and the importance of father\u2013infant involvement in domains other than feeding maybe beneficial in supporting breastfeeding and the father\u2013infant relationship.",

    "abstract": "The serotonin system has been implicated in the pathophysiology of anorexia nervosa (AN). A recent report proposed that body image distortion (BID), a core symptom of AN, may relate to abnormalities of the serotonin system, especially the serotonin transporter (5HTT). Positron emission tomography (PET) studies of underweight patients with active AN reported alterations in serotonin receptors, but not 5HTT. Here, we aimed to disclose the clinicopathophysiology of AN by focusing on 5HTT and cognitive functions, including BID, in groups with active AN. Twenty-two underweight female patients with AN (12 restricting-type AN (ANR); 10 binge-eating/purging-type AN (ANBP)) and 20 age-matched healthy female subjects underwent PET with a 5HTT radioligand [ 11 C]DASB. The binding potential (BP ND ) of [ 11 C]DASB was estimated semiquantitatively, and clinical data from Raven's colored progressive matrices for general intelligence, the Stroop test for focused attention, the Iowa gambling task for decision making and a dot-probe task designed for BID were compared with the levels of BP ND in different groups. [ 11 C]DASB BP ND was significantly decreased in the medial parietal cortex in patients with AN and in the dorsal raphe in patients with ANR compared with healthy subjects ( p <\u202f.05 corrected). Patients with ANR showed a significantly negative correlation between [ 11 C]DASB BP ND in the dorsal raphe and performance on the dot-probe task ( p <\u202f.05 corrected). While reduced 5HTT in the medial parietal cortex (the somatosensory association area) is pathophysiologically important in AN in general, additional 5HTT reduction in the dorsal raphe as seen in ANR is implicated for the clinicopathophysiological relevance. \u2022 5HTT decreased in the parietal cortex in patients with AN. \u2022 5HTT decreased in the parietal cortex in patients with ANBP. \u2022 5HTT decreased in the parietal cortex and the dorsal raphe in patients with ANR. \u2022 Patients with AN were poor at responding to the test for body image distortion (BID). \u2022 5HTT in the dorsal raphe was associated with cognitive performance of BID. 5HTT decreased in the parietal cortex in patients with AN. 5HTT decreased in the parietal cortex in patients with ANBP. 5HTT decreased in the parietal cortex and the dorsal raphe in patients with ANR.

Participants from the Framingham Heart Study, Third Generation and Omni 2 cohorts (n = 3551, 53.1% women, mean age 46.4 years) were screened for binge eating. We used multivariable-adjusted regression models to examine the associations of OBE with metabolic risk factors. The prevalence of OBE was 4.8% in women and 4.9% in men. Compared to non-binge eating, OBE was associated with higher odds of hypertension (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.32\u20132.60), hypertriglyceridemia (OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.01\u20132.01), low HDL (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.18\u20132.44), insulin resistance (OR 3.18, 95% CI 2.25\u20134.50) and metabolic syndrome (OR 2.75, 95% CI 1.94\u20133.90). Fasting glucose was 7.2 mg/dl higher in those with OBE (p=0.0001). Individuals with OBE had more visceral, subcutaneous and liver fat. Most of these associations were attenuated with adjustment for BMI, with the exception of fasting glucose. Binge eating is associated with a high burden of metabolic risk factors. Much of the associated risk appears to be mediated by BMI, with the exception of fasting glucose.",

    "abstract": "Hydrogen plays a key role in many microbial metabolic pathways in the human gastrointestinal tract (GIT) that have an impact on human nutrition, health and wellbeing. Hydrogen is produced by many members of the GIT microbiota, and may be subsequently utilized by cross-feeding microbes for growth and in the production of larger molecules. Hydrogenotrophic microbes fall into three functional groups: sulfate-reducing bacteria, methanogenic archaea and acetogenic bacteria, which can convert hydrogen into hydrogen sulfide, methane and acetate, respectively. Despite different energy yields per molecule of hydrogen used between the functional groups, all three can coexist in the human GIT. The factors affecting the numerical balance of hydrogenotrophs in the GIT remain unconfirmed. There is increasing evidence linking both hydrogen sulfide and methane to GIT diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome, and strategies for the mitigation of such health problems through targeting of hydrogenotrophs constitute an important field for further investigation.",

Certain groups, such as those with pre-existing mental health difficulties, may be especially at risk. The current study explored perceived changes in eating, exercise, and body image during lockdown within the United Kingdom, using an online survey (n\u00a0=\u00a0264). There were large individual differences in perceived changes in eating, exercise, and body image in this period. Women were more likely than men to report increasing struggles with regulating eating, preoccupation with food and worsening body image. Those with a current/past diagnosis of eating disorders reported significantly greater difficulties in regulating eating, increased preoccupation with food, exercise thoughts and behaviours and concern about appearance, even when compared to those with other mental health and developmental disorders. Ongoing research to explore individual differences in the trajectories of change in eating, exercise and body image as lockdown measures ease will be important for understanding the full psychological impact of this pandemic and improve service and public health planning going forward.",

This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of breast shields with either a 105\u00b0 or a 90\u00b0 flange opening angle on breast drainage and milk volume expressed during pumping. This study was a cross\u2010over, randomized controlled non\u2010inferiority trial (Registration; NCT03091985). Mothers (n\u00a0=\u00a049) of breastfeeding infants participated in the study over two study sessions. Participants were randomly assigned to pump both breasts simultaneously for 15\u00a0minutes with either the 105\u00b0 or 90\u00b0 breast shield in the first session, and the other shield in the second session. Effectiveness (breast drainage) and efficiency (volume expressed) of both breast shields were assessed after 15\u00a0minutes of pumping. Intention\u2010to\u2010treat and per protocol analyses were performed to determine if the 105\u00b0 breast shield was non\u2010inferior to the 90\u00b0 breast shield for breast drainage and volume expressed. Perceived comfort was assessed via questionnaire. The 105\u00b0 breast shield was both non\u2010inferior and superior compared to the standard 90\u00b0 shield for breast drainage (intention\u2010to\u2010treat, 3.87% (0.01\u20107.72), P =\u00a0.049) and volume expressed (intention\u2010to\u2010treat, 9.14\u00a0mL (1.37\u201016.91), P =.02). In addition, the 105\u00b0 shield was rated as feeling more comfortable ( P <\u00a0.001) and as having an improved fit to the breast ( P <\u00a0.001) compared to the 90\u00b0 shield. Expressing with the 105\u00b0 breast shield was more efficient, effective and comfortable compared to the 90\u00b0 shield. Breast shield design can significantly impact pumping outcomes, and an opening angle of 105\u00b0 improves both the dynamics and comfort of milk removal.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: To investigate whether the prevalence of eating disorders (EDs) differs across diverse gender identity groups in a transgender sample. Methods: Secondary analysis of data from Project VOICE, a cross-sectional study of stress and health among 452 transgender adults (ages 18\u201375 years) residing in Massachusetts. Age-adjusted logistic regression models were fit to compare the prevalence of self-reported lifetime EDs in female-to-male (FTM), male-to-female (MTF), and gender-nonconforming participants assigned male at birth (MBGNC) to gender-nonconforming participants assigned female at birth (FBGNC; referent). Results: The age-adjusted odds of self-reported ED in MTF participants were 0.14 times the odds of self-reported ED in FBGNC participants ( p =0.022). In FTM participants, the age-adjusted odds of self-reported ED were 0.46 times the odds of self-reported ED in FBGNC participants, a marginally significant finding ( p =0.068). No statistically significant differences in ED prevalence were found for MBGNC individuals. Conclusions: Gender nonconforming individuals assigned a female sex at birth appear to have heightened lifetime risk of EDs relative to MTF participants. Further research into specific biologic and psychosocial ED risk factors and gender-responsive intervention strategies are urgently needed. Training clinical providers and ensuring competency of treatment services beyond the gender binary will be vital to addressing this disparity.",

This study examined whether acculturation was associated with regularity of meals, eating-out, and overweight in Korean Americans. Pre-tested questionnaires were mailed to a U.S. national sample with Korean American surnames, and 55% of the deliverable sample responded, producing 356 usable questionnaires. Acculturation was measured using a two-culture matrix model and Gordon's theoretical work, and showed there were three distinct groups (acculturated, bicultural, and traditional). Only 36% reported that they regularly ate three meals a day. Breakfast was the least frequent meal of the day with 43% reporting eating breakfast everyday. More than half (58%) reported that they usually eat out or get take-out food at least once a week. After controlling for age, sex, income, education, and working status, higher acculturation was related to greater regularity of eating-out, but not meal regularity. A total of 28% of men and 6% of women were overweight (BMI>25), and there were significant and positive relationships between body weight status and acculturation in men but not women. However, no significant relationships between frequency of meals and eating-out and overweight status were present. This study did not find significant relationships of meal regularity and eating-out with body weight, however, given the positive relationship between acculturation and eating-out among the subjects and the well-established relationship between eating-out and obesity, nutrition education about skipping meals and eating-for Korean Americans may be useful to prevent such relationships from developing.",

    "abstract": "Fussy eating is common in young children, often raising concerns among parents. The use of pressuring feeding practices may provoke or worsen child fussiness, but these practices could equally be a parent\u2019s response to child fussy eating. In longitudinal analyses, we assessed directionality in the relation between fussy eating and parent\u2019s pressure to eat across childhood. Study participants were 4845 mother-child dyads from the population-based Generation R cohort in the Netherlands. The Child Behavior Checklist was used to assess fussy eating (2 items) at child ages 1\u00bd, 3 and 6 years. Parents\u2019 pressure to eat was assessed with the Child Feeding Questionnaire (4 items) when children were 4 years old. All scale scores were standardized. Linear regression analyses indicated that preschoolers\u2019 fussy eating prospectively predicted higher levels of parents\u2019 pressure to eat at child age 4 years, independently of confounders (adjusted B=0.24, 95% CI: 0.21, 0.27). Pressure to eat at 4 years also predicted more fussiness in children at age 6 years, independently of confounders and of fussy eating at baseline (adjusted B=0.14, 95% CI: 0.11, 0.17). Path analyses indicated that the relation from fussy eating at 3 years to parenting one year later was stronger than from pressure at 4 years to fussy eating two years later (p<0.001). Our findings suggest bi-directional associations with parental pressuring feeding strategies being developed in response to children\u2019s food avoidant behaviors, but also seemingly having a counterproductive effect on fussiness. Thus, the use of pressure to eat should be reconsidered, while providing parents alternative techniques to deal with their child\u2019s fussy eating.",

Here, we describe a hormone, mimecan, which is abundantly expressed in adipose tissue. Mimecan was observed to inhibit food intake and reduce body weight in mice. Intraperitoneal injection of a mimecan-maltose binding protein (-MBP) complex inhibited food intake in C57BL/6J mice, which was attenuated by pretreatment with polyclonal antibody against mimecan. Notably, mimecan-MBP also induced anorexia in A y /a and db / db mice. Furthermore, the expression of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and IL-6 was up-regulated in the hypothalamus by mimecan-MBP, as well as in N9 microglia cells by recombinant mouse mimecan.

While international guidelines are available to direct the use of enteral nutrition (EN), there are no recommendations specific to Indian settings. Advisory board meetings were arranged to develop the practice guidelines specific to Indian context, for the use of EN in critically ill patients and to overcome challenges in this field. Various existing guidelines, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, controlled trials, and review articles were reviewed for their contextual relevance and strength. A systematic grading of practice guidelines by advisory board was done based on strength of the supporting evidence. Wherever Indian studies were not available, references were taken from the international guidelines. Based on the literature review, the recommendations for developing the practice guidelines were made as per the grading criteria agreed upon by the advisory board. The recommendations were to address challenges regarding EN versus parenteral nutrition; nutrition screening and assessment; nutrition in hemodynamically unstable; route of nutrition; tube feeding and challenges; tolerance; optimum calorie-protein requirements; selection of appropriate enteral feeding formula; micronutrients and immune-nutrients; standard nutrition in hepatic, renal, and respiratory diseases and documentation of nutrition practices. This paper summarizes the optimum nutrition practices for critically ill patients. The possible solutions to overcome the challenges in this field are presented as practice guidelines at the end of each section. These guidelines are expected to provide guidance in critical care settings regarding appropriate critical-care nutrition practices and to set up Intensive Care Unit nutrition protocols.",

Sweating data (local sweat onset time, local sweat volume, activated sweat glands, sweat output per gland, whole body sweat loss volume) were measured by the capacitance hygrometer-ventilated capsule method and starch-iodide paper. Mean body temperature was calculated from tympanic and skin temperatures. Local sweat onset time was shorter for tennis athletes ( p <  0.001). Local sweat volume, activated sweat glands of the torso and limbs, sweat output per gland, and whole body sweat loss volume were significantly higher for tennis athletes than control subjects after active heating ( p <  0.001).

The objective was to determine if transitioning to an optimized, fixed-dose supplementary feeding regimen during SAM treatment when MUAC is >11.4\u00a0cm would result in noninferior gain in MUAC compared with standard treatment. Using data from 2 clinical trials conducted in Sierra Leone, a retrospective dual-cohort study was performed. The 2 cohorts included children with SAM who had improved to meet criteria for moderate acute malnutrition (MAM). The standard dose cohort continued to receive weight-based RUTF at 175\u00a0kcal/kg per day, while the optimized dose cohort received fixed-dose, 500\u00a0kcal/d of supplementary feeding. The primary outcome was a noninferiority margin of 1\u00a0mm of MUAC after 4 wk of treatment, while secondary outcomes included rate of anthropometric changes as well as time-to-relapse to SAM or death. MUAC after 4 wk was noninferior (\u0394: \u22120.1\u00a0mm; 95% CI: \u22120.05, 0.03; inferiority rejected P =\u00a00.008). Rates of weight gain and MUAC gain were the same in the optimized-dose and standard-dose groups, whereas the rate of length gain was slower in the optimized-dose cohort. Time-to-relapse to SAM or death was not different (HR: 1.05; P =\u00a00.71). This study supports the practice of treating children with SAM who have recovered to meet criteria for MAM with a reduced and fixed-dose regimen of RUTF. The results also raise the question of whether this strategy might adversely impact linear growth during SAM treatment. We found that reducing the dose of therapeutic food for children with severe acute malnutrition during recovery results in a similar resolution of wasting, but may result in a reduced linear growth.",

To provide a preliminary qualitative and quantitative synthesis of the placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) considering the efficacy and tolerability of lisdexamfetamine in the acute and/or maintenance treatment of moderate-to-severe BED in adults. A preliminary, yet comprehensive, systematic review was performed by accessing a broad range of resources providing publicly available data about lisdexamfetamine at the time of inquiry (March 2016). Study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions were considered focusing on major clinical and functional outcomes of either efficacy or tolerability of lisdexamfetamine in the treatment of moderate-to-severe BED in adults. Meta-analysis of data pooled from three acute RCTs significantly favored lisdexamfetamine over placebo in the reduction of binge eating days/week, Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale Modified for Binge Eating total score, weight, response, and remission rates (all, P \u22640.01). In contrast, discontinuation rates due to treatment-emergent adverse events were significantly higher among patients in receipt of lisdexamfetamine (relative risk 2.19, P =0.04) versus placebo. Publication, selection, performance, attrition, reporting, sponsorship, and \u201cdiagnostic shift\u201d biases. Lack of inclusion of adverse event effects other than those requiring discontinuation of the trial(s), as well as lack of information about clinically relevant psychiatric or other medical comorbidities, limits the overall generalizability of pooled results. Across the included acute phase RCTs, lisdexamfetamine (at 30, 50, or 70 mg/day) led to significant reduction in a number of clinically relevant outcomes compared to placebo. Moreover, safety concerns related to adverse events, high discontinuation rates, and the need for additional long-term maintenance of RCTs solicit careful monitoring of the drug in terms of overall safety and tolerability by further RCTs.",

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 30 patients with primary SRED (without any comorbid sleep disorders and who were not taking any possible causative medications), and ten patients with drug-induced SRED (occurrence of SRED episodes after starting nightly medication of sedative drugs, which completely resolved after dose reduction or discontinuation of the sedatives). All patients with drug-induced SRED took multiple types of sedatives, such as benzodiazepines or benzodiazepine receptor agonists. Clinical features of drug-induced SRED compared with primary SRED were as follows: higher mean age of onset (40 years old in drug-induced SRED vs 26 years old in primary SRED), significantly higher rate of patients who had total amnesia during most of their SRED episodes (75.0% vs 31.8%), significantly lower rate of comorbidity of night eating syndrome (0% vs 63.3%), and significantly lower rate of history of sleepwalking (10.0% vs 46.7%). Increased doses of benzodiazepine receptor agonists may be responsible for drug-induced SRED. The clinical features of drug-induced SRED were different from those of primary SRED, possibly reflecting differences in the underlying mechanisms between these two categories of SREDs.",

    "abstract": "With any new disease a framework for development of preventative or treatment therapeutics is key; the absence of such in COVID\u201019 has enabled ineffective and potentially unsafe treatments to be taken up by Governments and clinicians desperate to have options for patients. As we still have few therapies and nil vaccines yet available, the void of a clear framework for research and practice is increasingly clear. We describe a framework that has been used to prioritise therapeutic research in previous pandemics which could be used to progress clinical pharmacology and therapeutics research in COVID\u201019. This is particularly relevant as discussion has already moved on from antiviral therapeutics, to delineating the treatment of the host from treatment and elimination of the infective agent. Focussing on the host brings together three concepts; host treatment, the damage response framework and therapeutic repurposing. The integration of these three areas play to the traditional strength of pharmaceuticals in providing a period of stabilization to permit time for the development of novel anti\u2010viral drugs and vaccines. In integrating approaches to repurposing, host treatment and damage response we identified three key properties that a potentially effective repurposed drug must possess by way of a framework . There must be homology i.e. the same or similar relation, with the pathogenesis of the disease, ideally targeted to the conserved pathophysiological outcomes of the viral attack, have a defined locus within the spectrum from prevention to severe disease and draw upon the historical dose and safety experience of the repurposed drug. To illustrate, we have mapped therapeutics that impact upon a key dysregulated pathway in COVID\u201019 \u2010 the renin angiotensin system\u2010 using this approach. Collectively this type of analysis reveals the importance of existing data (repurposed information and administrative observational) and the importance of the details of the known pathophysiological response to viruses in approaches to treating the host.",

This is reflected in policy and health promotion strategies to increase breast feeding, which gives the best source of nutrients for healthy infant growth and development. However, the rate of breast feeding in Scotland remains one of the lowest in Europe. Information is needed to provide a better understanding of infant feeding and its impact on child health. This paper describes the development of a unique population-wide resource created to explore infant feeding and child health in Scotland. Descriptive and multivariate analyses of linked routine/administrative maternal and infant health records for 731\u2005595 infants born in Scotland between 1997 and 2009. A linked dataset was created containing a wide range of background, parental, maternal, birth and health service characteristics for a representative sample of infants born in Scotland over the study period. There was high coverage and completeness of infant feeding and other demographic, maternal and infant records. The results confirmed the importance of an enabling environment\u2014cultural, family, health service and other maternal and infant health-related factors\u2014in increasing the likelihood to breast feed. Using the linked dataset, it was possible to investigate the determinants of breast feeding for a representative sample of Scottish infants born between 1997 and 2009.\u00a0The linked dataset is an important resource that has potential uses in research, policy design and targeting intervention programmes.",

Most Chinese surgeons have a preference for parenteral nutrition even though it has some disadvantages compared with jejunostomy. In this report, we describe a new approach that allows the quick insertion of a feeding tube in Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy. We retrospectively analyze cases that have applied this approach and compare the advantages and disadvantages of jejunostomy. Between January 2010 and December 2012, 131 patients underwent Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy in our hospital. These patients were divided into three groups: the total parenteral nutrition (PN) group, the jejunostomy (JT) group and the feeding tube (FT) group. The effect and safety of the procedure were compared. It took approximately 20 minutes longer to perform jejunostomy compared to placing a feeding tube ( P < 0.05). The nutrition cost of the JT group was higher than the FT group ( P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the FT and JT groups ( P > 0.05) in the ratio of body weight loss seven days post-surgery. The anal exsufflation time of the FT group was similar to the JT group ( P > 0.05). The incidence of intestinal adhesion and obstruction in the JT group was 26.3%, which is much higher than in the FT and PN groups ( P < 0.05). Placing the feeding tube after Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy can decrease operative damage and bring sufficient nutrition. We believe it can be an alternative to jejunostomy in Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy.",

However, it is currently unknown how the size of the recruited muscle mass interacts with that mechanism. To investigate the possible muscle-size dependency of that non-thermal sweating, the recruitment of two muscle groups of significantly different size was investigated in individuals within whom steady-state thermal sweating had been established and clamped. Methods : Fourteen passively heated subjects (climate chamber and water-perfusion garment) performed 60-s, static handgrip and knee-extension activations at 30% and 50% of maximal voluntary force, plus a handgrip at 40% intensity (143.4\u00a0N) and a third knee extension at the same absolute force. Local sweating from four body segments (averaged to represent whole-body sudomotor activity), three deep-body and eight skin temperatures, heart rates and perceptions of physical effort were measured continuously, and analyzed over the final 30\u00a0s of exercise. Results : In the presence of thermal clamping and low-level, steady-state sweating, static muscle activation resulted in exercise-intensity dependent changes in the whole-body sudomotor response during these handgrip and knee-extension actions ( P < 0.05). However, there was no evidence of a dependency on the size of the recruited muscle mass ( P > 0.05), yet both dependencies were apparent for heart rate, and partially evident for the sensations of physical effort. Conclusion : These observations represent the first evidence that exercise-related sudomotor feedforward is not influenced by the size of the activated muscle mass, but is instead primarily dictated by the intensity of the exercise itself.",

Patient demographics, the approach to esophagectomy, the extent of gastrectomy, FJT placement and utilization at discharge, administration of parenteral nutrition (PN), and complications were evaluated. All patients were followed for at least ninety days or until death. The 287 patients underwent upper GI resection, comprised of 182 esophagectomy ( n = 107 transhiatal, 58.7%; n = 56 Ivor-Lewis, 30.7%) and 105 gastrectomy [ n = 63 subtotal (SG), 60.0%; n = 42 total (TG), 40.0%]. 181 of 182 esophagectomy patients underwent FJT, compared with 47 of 105 gastrectomy patients (99.5% vs 44.8%, P < 0.0001), of whom most had undergone TG ( n = 39, 92.9% vs n = 8 SG, 12.9%, P < 0.0001). Median length of stay was similar between esophagectomy and gastrectomy groups (14.7 d vs 17.1 d, P = 0.076).

Meanwhile, 20 of 39 TG patients (51.3%) were either fully ( n = 3, 7.7%) or partially ( n = 17, 43.6%) dependent on tube feeds, compared with 5 of 8 SG patients (10.6%), all of whom were partially dependent. Gastrectomy patients were significantly less likely to be fully dependent on tube feeds at discharge compared to esophagectomy patients (6.4% vs 29.3%, P = 0.0006).

In the current study, in-depth interviews were conducted with 15 autistic women with experience of anorexia nervosa, 12 parents of autistic women with anorexia nervosa, and 11 eating disorder healthcare professionals. Using thematic analysis, three overarching themes were identified: misunderstanding autism and autistic traits, one treatment does not fit all, and improving accessibility and engagement within services. We found that there were diverse barriers facing autistic women when in treatment for anorexia nervosa, and these were accentuated by a lack of autism understanding within eating disorder services. Future research should focus on developing interventions that are tailored to the specific needs of autistic individuals with anorexia nervosa.

    "abstract": "Obesity is a worldwide epidemic problem. The downward trend of an obesity onset age calls for research efforts on how to develop useful nutrition educational programs for children to maintain adequate body weight. Understanding the roles of objective and subjective body status in obesity-related attitudes, knowledge, and behaviors can provide important information. The current study aimed to examine obesity-related attitudes and knowledge and practices of eating behavior guidelines in relation to obesity and body shape satisfaction among children. The gender effect in the relations was also investigated. A self-administered survey was conducted with 260 fifth grade children at 2 public elementary schools in the suburbs of Seoul. Information on demographics, body size, body satisfaction, obesity-related attitudes and knowledge, and eating behaviors was collected. Study findings from one-way analysis of variance tests indicated no differences in mean scores of the attitudes, knowledge, and eating behaviors across the levels of obesity for both gender. The levels of body shape satisfaction was, however, found to be significantly related with the attitudes and eating behaviors in girls, while no such relation was seen in boys. Girls with lower body shape dissatisfaction had significantly more negative attitudes toward obesity which was not translated into practice of healthy eating behaviors. That is, contrary to general expectation, the level of practicing the eating behavior guidelines was significantly lower in those girls. While underlying reasons for this observation is not fully answered, gender-specific, body satisfaction-stratified, and behavior-focused approach in designing obesity prevention programs for elementary school girls is suggested efficient and useful.",

    "abstract": "In Japan, growth hormone releasing peptide-2 (GHRP-2) is clinically used as a diagnostic agent for growth hormone secretion deficiency, but the therapeutic application of GHRP-2 has not been studied in anorexia nervosa. GHRP-2 reportedly exhibits agonistic action for ghrelin receptor and increases food intake. We administered GHRP-2 to a patient with a 20-year history of anorexia nervosa to determine whether GHRP-2 treatment increases food intake and body weight. GHRP-2 was administered before every meal by an intranasal approach for 1 year. Although the patient reported a decreased fear of eating and decreased desire to be thin by our previous treatment, she was unable to increase food intake or body weight because of digestive tract dysfunction. Vomiting after meals caused by delayed gastric emptying and incurable constipation were prolonged, and sub-ileus and hypoglycemia were observed. GHRP-2 increased the feeling of hunger and food intake, decreased early satiety and improved hypoglycemia. The patient's body weight gradually increased by 6.7 kg (from 21.1 kg to 27.8 kg) in 14 months after starting GHRP-2 administration. The fatigability and muscle strength improved, and the physical and mental activities were also increased. No obvious side effects were observed after long-term intranasal administration of GHRP-2. Patients with a long-term history of eating disorder occasionally recover from the psychological problems such as fear for obesity but remain emaciated. We believe that ghrelin agonists such as GHRP-2 may be promising agents for the effective treatments of severe anorexia nervosa in a chronic condition.",

A community sample of women, ages 18\u201339, who had either given birth in the past 12\u00a0months ( n =\u2009232) or had no pregnancy history ( n =\u2009137; controls), was recruited to complete an online survey about their depressive, anxiety, OCD, and eating disorder symptoms. Postpartum women reported greater OCD-type symptoms related to concerns about both contamination and responsibility for harm ( p s\u2009<\u2009.05) compared to controls. After controlling for general stress and mental health history, the association between 2019-nCOV distress and OCD-type symptoms related to concerns about contamination was stronger among postpartum compared to control women ( p s\u2009<\u2009.002). For all women, 2019-nCOV distress was positively related to general anxiety symptoms, total OCD-type symptoms, and OCD-type symptoms related to concerns about responsibility for harm after controlling for general stress and mental health history ( p s\u2009<\u2009.03).

    "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa (AN) is an eating disorder characterised by restriction of energy intake, fears of gaining weight and related body image disturbances. The oxytocinergic system has been proposed as a pathophysiological candidate for AN. Oxytocin is a neuropeptide involved in bodily processes (eg, breast feeding) and in the onset of social behaviours (eg, bonding). Studies investigating the effect of intranasal oxytocin (IN-OT) in AN showed that it can improve attentional bias for high-calorie food and fat bodies stimuli, and related stress. However, less is known about the effect of IN-OT on bodily awareness and body image distortions, key features of the disorder linked to its development, prognosis and maintenance. Here, we aim to investigate the effect of IN-OT on the perception of affective, C-tactile-optimal touch, known to be impaired in AN and on multisensory integration processes underlying a body ownership illusion (ie, rubber hand illusion). For exploratory purposes, we will also investigate the effect of IN-OT on another interoceptive modality, namely cardiac awareness and its relationship with affective touch. Forty women with AN and forty matched healthy controls will be recruited and tested in two separate sessions; self-administering IN-OT (40 IU) or placebo, intranasally, in a pseudo-randomised manner. The data from this double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study will be analysed using linear mixed models that allow the use of both fixed (treatment levels) and random (subjects) effects in the same analysis. To address our main hypotheses, separate analyses will be run for the affective touch task, where the primary outcome dependent variable will be the pleasantness of the touch, and for the rubber hand illusion, where we will investigate multisensory integration quantified as subjective embodiment towards the rubber hand. In the latter, we will manipulate the synchronicity of touch and the size of the hand. Ethics approval has been obtained by National Research Ethics Service NRES Committee London (Queen\u2019s Square Committee, ref number 14/LO/1593). The results will be disseminated through conference presentations and publication in peer-reviewed journals.",

We investigated the effect of COVID-19 pandemic in the treatment practice of head and neck oncology patients in the UK. There is variability in practice in feeding tube policy, radiotherapy fractionation and schedule as well as concurrent chemotherapy and palliative systemic treatment use across the UK oncology centres. 15/23 participating centres (65%) changed to either a hypofractionation or acceleration schedule during COVID-19 pandemic. 12/23 participating centres (56.5%) followed selective omission of concurrent chemoradiotherapy. There are variations across UK centres for the standard practice as well as treatment modifications during Covid-19 pandemic; a timely consensus on head and neck cancer management and guidance on treatment modifications for future pandemic is required. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated rapid changes to the practice of head and neck oncology in UK. There was a delay between the onset of the pandemic and the release of guidelines from cancer societies and networks, leading to a variable response of individual centres. This survey was conducted to assess the pre-Covid-19 pandemic standard of practice for head and neck oncology patients and the treatment modifications introduced during the first wave of the pandemic in UK. The UK National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) Head and Neck Clinical Studies Group initiated a multi-centre survey using questionnaire to investigate the effect on feeding tube practice, radiotherapy (RT) fractionation and volumes, use of chemotherapy in the neo-adjuvant, concurrent and palliative setting, the use of immunotherapy in the palliative setting, access to radiology and histopathology services, and availability of surgical procedures. 30 centres were approached across UK; 23 (76.7%) centres responded and were included in the survey. There were differences in the standard practices in feeding tube policy, RT dose and fractionation as well as concurrent chemotherapy use. 21 (91%) participating centres had at least one treatment modification. 15 (65%) centres initiated a change in radical RT; changing to either a hypofractionation or acceleration schedule. For post-operative RT 10 centres (43.5%) changed to a hypofractionation schedule. 12 (52.2%) centres stopped neo-adjuvant chemotherapy for all patients; 13 (56.5%) centres followed selective omission of chemotherapy in concurrent chemo-radiotherapy patients, 17 (73.9%) centres changed first-line chemotherapy treatment to pembrolizumab (following NHS England\u2019s interim guidance) and 8 (34.8%) centres stopped the treatment early or offered delays for patients that have been already on systemic treatment. The majority of centres did not have significant changes associated with surgery, radiology, histopathology and dental screening. There are variations in the standard of practice and treatment modifications for head and neck cancer patients during Covid-19 pandemic. A timely initiative is required to form a consensus on head and neck cancer management in the UK and other countries.",

Antenatal mothers need to be sufficiently aware about the benefits of breastfeeding. The aim of this study is to assess the awareness and perception of breastfeeding among antenatal mothers and to find out any association between sociodemographic factors and breastfeeding awareness. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 250 antenatal women residing in the urban slums of field-practice area of urban health and training center; using a predesigned, pretested, semi-structured interview schedule. Antenatal checkup followed by one to one counseling for the women regarding breastfeeding was provided. Data were represented by frequencies, proportions, and associations using Chi-square, and the P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Most (55.6%) of the women were in the age group of 18\u201324 years. The mean age at marriage was 19.2 \u00b1 2.5 years. 81.2% of them were Hindus, 13.2% had adequate, 49.6% had moderately adequate, whereas 37.2% women had inadequate awareness about breastfeeding. About 100% intended to breastfeed their children, but only 64% said that they intended to exclusively breastfeed. 66.4% knew about the importance of colostrum. Age-group, religion, literacy, occupation, type of family, gravida, and number of antenatal visits showed highly significant ( P < 0.001) association with awareness of breastfeeding. Nearly one-third of the antenatal mothers lacked awareness on breastfeeding practices. Although all intended to breastfeed, still only 64% knew about exclusive breastfeeding. These gaps need to be addressed by awareness generation activities during antenatal counseling.",

    "abstract": "Binge eating disorder (BED) is the most common of eating disorders and is characterized by excessive, out-of-control, rapid food intake. This review focuses on cognitive impairments in BED, which represent an endophenotype that mediates brain function and behavior. Here we focus on reviewing impulsivity, compulsivity, attentional biases to food cues, and executive function. Behavioral regulation in BED appears to be influenced by the context of motivationally salient food cues and the degree of obesity. Deficits in delay discounting and risk taking under ambiguity are impaired in obesity irrespective of BED status. However, in BED subjects with milder obesity, greater risk seeking under explicit probabilistic risk is observed to monetary rewards, whereas this shifts to risk aversion and enhanced delay discounting in more severe obesity. Relative to non-BED obese subjects, BED is characterized by enhanced behavioral inflexibility or compulsivity across multiple domains, with subjects selecting the same choices despite change in relevance (set shifting), being no longer rewarding (habit formation), or irrespective of outcome (perseveration). The context of food cues was associated with multiple attentional and early and late inhibitory impairments and enhanced memory bias, although BED patients also have generalized cognitive interference in working memory. These findings may help explain the phenotype of binge eating. Motivationally salient food cues provoke attentional and memory biases along with impairing response inhibitory processes. Those with BED are also more susceptible to cognitive interference and have impaired decisional impulsivity, with the tendency to inflexibly stick with the same choices irrespective of changes in context. These findings suggest critical cognitive domains that may guide therapeutic interventions.",

Feeding practices, especially breastfeeding influence gut microbiome and thereby play a pivotal role in immune and neural development. Current understandings of the role of healthy distal gut microflora in the development of immune and neural systems provide insights into immunological mechanisms as one of the possible etiologies in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Studies have shown that optimal breastfeeding is associated with lower odds of being at-risk for ASD and children with ASD are suboptimally breastfed. The feeding practices of children with ASD ( n = 30) was compared to their typically developing siblings as matched controls ( n = 30). Information regarding feeding practices was collected from mothers through a semi-structured questionnaire. About 43.3% of children with ASD received exclusive breastfeeding, whereas 76.7% of their typically developing siblings were exclusively breastfed. Exclusive breastfeeding was associated with lower odds for ASD (odds ratio [OR] = 0.166; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.025\u20130.65), while early introduction of top feeds was associated with higher odds (OR = 6; 95% CI = 1.33\u201355.19). Difficulties in breastfeeding were attributed to child-related factors in 13.2% of the children. Children with ASD are suboptimally breastfed compared to their typically developing siblings. Exclusive breastfeeding may confer protection in vulnerable children. Further studies on larger prospective sample are required to establish the association.",

So the validity of feeding and eating disorders in the upcoming ICD-11 guide for Chinese patients is unclear. To explore the latent class structure of Chinese patients with eating disorder and the cross-cultural validity of the eating disorder section of the new ICD-11 guide in China. A total of 379 patients with eating disorders at Shanghai Mental Health Center were evaluated using the EDI questionnaire and a questionnaire developed by researchers from 2010 to 2016. SPSS 20.0 was used to enter data and analyze demographic data, and Latent GOLD was employed to conduct latent profile analysis. According to the results of latent profile analysis, patients with eating disorder were divided into five classes: low-weight fasting class (23.1%), non-fat-phobic binge/purge class (21.54%), low-fat-phobic binge class (19.27%), fat-phobic binge class (19.27%), and non-fat-phobic low-weight class (16.76%). Among the clinical symptoms extracted, there were significant differences in Body Mass Index (BMI), binge eating behavior, self-induced vomiting, laxative use and fat-phobic opinion; while there was no significant difference in restrictive food intake. Based on the clinical symptoms, there are five latent classes in Chinese patients with eating disorder, which is in accordance with the diagnostic categories of feeding and eating disorder in ICD-11. However, further work is needed in improving the fat-phobic opinion of patients with eating disorder and clarifying the BMI standard of thinness in the Chinese population.",

The leading factor contributing to the intensification of AR symptoms was the central heating (OR = 1.45358). As opposed to AR, people living in buildings with central heating less often declared asthma (OR = 0.8407). A clinical examination confirmed that central heating reduced the symptoms of moderate asthma (OR = 0.3524).

Motivational interviewing is a client-centered approach that embodies many principles and strategies consistent with a strong therapeutic alliance. To examine whether alliance is enhanced by training dietitians to deliver a motivational interviewing informed health behavior change intervention (\u201cEating as Treatment\u201d; EAT) as part of routine consultations with patients with head and neck cancer. The predictive ability of motivational interviewing techniques was also assessed. A secondary analysis of the EAT stepped-wedge cluster-randomized controlled trial was conducted. Patients with head and neck cancer undergoing radiotherapy ( n = 307) were treated by radiotherapy dietitians ( n = 29) during the control (Treatment as Usual) or intervention (EAT) phase. Alliance was rated during the first and final weeks of radiotherapy, and again 4 and 12 weeks post-radiotherapy. Dietetic sessions were audiotaped. Week one sessions were objectively rated for dietitians\u2019 use of motivational interviewing techniques. Generalized linear-mixed effects regressions found no effect of EAT on dietitian-rated alliance ( p = .237). After excluding outliers, patient-rated alliance was 0.29 points lower after EAT training ( p = .016). Post hoc analyses revealed lower patient ratings on perceived support and dietitian confidence. Hierarchical multiple regressions found that no specific motivational interviewing techniques predicted patient-rated alliance. Dietitian acknowledgment of patient challenges was related to dietitian-rated alliance (\u03b2 =.15, p =.035).

Current evidence lacks a consistent relationship between alcohol consumption and weight gain, and there remains a paucity of research examining the effect of alcohol intake on body weight and BMI over time. This study seeks to examine the effect of grade when students are first classified as \u201ccurrent drinker\u201d and \u201ccurrent binge drinker\u201d on weight and weight status (BMI) trajectories. Two waves of 4-year linked longitudinal data (Y1:2012\u201313 to Y4:2015\u201316 and Y2:2013\u201314 to Y5:2016\u201317) collected from the COMPASS study (a large prospective cohort study examining health behaviours among Canadian high school students), were used to examine alcohol intake and weight gain among students in grade 9 at their respective baseline year (Y1, n\u202f=\u202f1180 or Y2, n\u202f=\u202f1612). A modest association between alcohol intake and increased body weight was seen in students who reported binge drinking and earlier onset of alcohol consumption (initiation in grade 10), compared to those who never became binge drinkers, or those who started drinking in grade 11 or grade 12. This additional increase was sustained in grade 11 in males but not females. In contrast, those categorized as \u201ccurrent drinkers\u201d showed no significant increases in weight compared to non-drinkers regardless of grade of initiation. More research should investigate the association between binge drinking and weight gain in high school and beyond, specifically in relation to gender, to approach this issue comprehensively.",

Here we investigated whether food distribution (i.e., uniform, slightly clumped, and highly clumped) affects the behavioral response of mallards foraging alone or competing with another. Although the amount of food was the same in all distributions, the mallards reached higher intake rates, visited fewer patches, and showed longer average feeding times in the highly clumped distribution. Competing mallards had lower intake rates on the slightly clumped than on the uniform or highly clumped food distributions. Subordinates generally visited more patches and had shorter feeding times per patch, but their intake rates were not significantly lower than those of dominants. Therefore, we propose that subordinates do not necessarily suffer from interference competition in terms of intake rate, but do suffer higher search costs. In addition, although dominants had significantly higher average feeding times on the best quality patches of the highly clumped food distribution, such an effect was not found in the slightly clumped distribution. These findings indicate that in environments where food is aggregated to a lesser extent, monopolization is not the best strategy for dominants. Our results suggest that interference experiments should use food distributions that resemble the natural situation animals are faced with in the field.",

    "abstract": "Polyacrylic acid, polyalkenoic acids in general, form the liquid ionomer phase of glass ionomer cements, which are frequently used in root restorations in dentistry. It is possible to obtain these ionomers with a fast, energy-efficient, high reaction efficiency and a clean method with microwave irradiation method. In this study, polyacrylic acid and its composite with nano HAp have been synthesized by microwave (MW) irradiation. The two-process parameters that were tested are MW intensity and reaction time. The polymerization was carried out at 110 \u00b0C up to 40 min and yield over 92% was produced in 30 min. The average molar mass of PAA was found as 11960 Da using a high-resolution mass spectrometer (TOF-MS). On the other hand, hydroxyapatite (HAp) nanoparticles have been prepared via the sol-gel procedure using potassium dihydrogen phosphate and calcium nitrate tetrahydrate as the precursors for phosphorus and calcium, respectively. XRD, EDS analysis revealed that the particles contain calcium deficient hydroxyapatite (Ca 10-x (HPO 4 ) x (PO 4 ) 6-x (OH) 2-x (HAp) crystals with beta-TCP phase. Morphological observation by SEM measurement proved that the crystal particles of the HAp are very regular and granular, and their size is 25\u201345 nm in the longitudinal section. These particles were used in composite preparation with PAA. The yield of the composite obtained by heating at 500 W, 30 min was found to be 90%. From the FTIR and 1 H-NMR results, it was observed that there was not only a physical but also an electrostatic interaction between HAp and PAA. The thermal behavior of PAA and its composite with nano HAp were determined by the thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA). The results showed that anhydride formation or decarboxylation occurred at a lower temperature, confirming the interaction between PAA and HAp. The polymerization rate is much faster with microwave heating than conventional heating. Microwave irradiation enables rapid energy transfer and high-energy efficiency, hence, a faster reaction rate.

    "abstract": "The true incidence of anorexia secondary to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and cancer is not well classified owing to the fact that there is a lack of standardized definitions and recent clinical data in these settings. Dronabinol, or \u0394-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, is a synthetic molecule that closely mimics the action of Cannabis sativa L., a naturally occurring compound activated in the central nervous system by cannabinoid receptors. Dronabinol exerts its effects by directly acting on the vomiting and appetite control centers in the brain, which in turn increases appetite and prevents vomiting. In the USA, dronabinol is currently available in two dosage formulations \u2013 oral capsule and oral solution. While the oral capsule was initially approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1985, the recent approval of the oral solution in 2016 presents an \u201ceasy-to-swallow\u201d alternative for patients using or intending to use dronabinol. Dronabinol is indicated in adult patients with HIV/AIDS for the treatment of anorexia and weight loss. However, there is no approved indication in the setting of cancer-related anorexia and weight loss. This review aims at presenting available data on the use of oral dronabinol in the management of anorexia and weight loss in HIV/AIDS and cancer, as well as characterizing and highlighting the pharmacotherapeutic considerations of the newest formulation of dronabinol.",

The purpose of the current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study was to pilot a comparison of the activity of the fronto-limbic and fronto-striatal brain areas during an emotion processing task in persons with ED. 24 women patients with ED were scanned, while showing emotionally stimulating (pleasant, unpleasant) and neutral images from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). During the pleasant condition, significant differences in Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (DLPFC) activations were found with AN participants presenting greater activation compared to BN and ED comorbid groups (EDc) and healthy controls also showing greater activation of this brain area compared to BN and EDc. Left putamen was less activated in EDc compared to both controls (C) and AN. During the unpleasant condition, AN participants showed hyperactivation of the Orbito-Frontal Cortex (OFC) when compared to EDc. This study highlights the potential functional relevance of brain areas that have been associated with self-control. These findings should help advance understanding the neural substrate of ED, though they should be considered as preliminary and be cautiously interpreted.",

The World Health Organisation (WHO) guidelines for inpatient nutritional rehabilitation of infants u6m is re\u2010lactation: the re\u2010establishment of exclusive breastfeeding. Evidence suggests these guidelines are rarely followed in many low\u2010income settings. Two studies of infant nutritional rehabilitation undertaken in three public hospitals in coastal Kenya employed breastfeeding peer supporters (BFPSs) to facilitate WHO guideline implementation. To explore the acceptability of the strategy to health workers (HWs) and the BFPSs, in\u2010depth interviews were conducted with 20 HWs and five BFPSs in the three study hospitals. The HWs reported that the presence of the BFPSs changed the way infant nutritional rehabilitation was managed, increasing efforts at relactation and decreasing reliance on supplemental milk. BFPSs were said to help address staff shortages and had dedicated time to support and assist the mothers. Key to the success of the BFPSs was the social relationships they were able to establish with the mothers due to the similarity in their experiences and backgrounds. Despite the success of the BFPSs, human resource management and infrastructure challenges remained. BFPSs can successfully be employed to facilitate the implementation of the WHO guidelines for the nutritional rehabilitation of acutely malnourished infants u6m in hospitals in Kenya, establishing supportive social relationships and trust with the mothers of the acutely malnourished infants and helping to address the issue of human resource shortages.",

There are 6 representative feeding disorder subtypes in young children: infantile anorexia, sensory food aversion, reciprocity, posttraumatic type, state regulation, and feeding disorders associated with concurrent medical conditions. Most feeding difficulties are nonorganic and without any underlying medical condition, but organic causes should also be excluded from the beginning, through thorough history taking and physical examination, based on red-flag symptoms and signs. Age-appropriate feeding principles may support effective treatment of feeding difficulties in practice, and systematic approaches for feeding difficulties in young children, based on each subtype, may be beneficial.",

There is no recent study conducted in the Iranian population about eating disorder and its variants. The aim of the present study is investigation of frequency of disturbed eating behaviors in adolescent girls with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) compared to non-diabetics. In this cross-sectional study, disturbed eating behavior were evaluated and compared in two groups of 12\u201322 year old adolescent and young females (126 with diabetes and 325 without diabetes). A self-report questionnaire including demographic data, Children's Depression Inventory (CDI), and Eating Attitude Test (EAT-26) was used for data gathering. Independent t -test, Chi-square test, and logistic regression [odds ratio (OR)] were used for data analyses in SPSS 15. Findings revealed that higher percentage of diabetic girls are likely to have eating disturbances (67.9% vs. 53.8%, P = 0.01). Diabetic group obtained higher scores in both dieting (14.95 \u00b1 6.28 vs. 11.79 \u00b1 5.62, P < 0.001) and bulimia scales (4.9 \u00b1 3.13 vs. 4.12 \u00b1 2.89, P = 0.017), which supports a role for T1DM in inducing the symptoms. Diabetic girls were at more than double the risk of developing eating disturbance. The results indicate that a significantly higher percentage of diabetic girls are likely to have eating disturbances. Also, diabetic subjects had an increased probability of getting higher scores in all three EAT-26 subscales. Therefore, healthcare professionals, especially diabetic nurses, should be aware of the potential effects of the subclinical and clinical eating behaviors on adolescents with T1DM and evaluate them for these disturbances.",

The intervention aimed to identify the underlying factors and approaches to improve selective eating in children and the self-efficacy of parents. Significant differences were observed before and after the intervention in the degree of difficulty perceived by parents, their degree of self-efficacy, the number of recommendations conducted by them, their subjective view of the degree of dietary imbalance, and the number of food items consumed by their children. We developed an interventional programme for parents of children with ASD and this programme was found to be useful.

Modifiable factors associated with increased breastfeeding, may be addressed through antenatal breastfeeding education. In Greece, the rates of exclusive breastfeeding remain rather low. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a structured in-hospital midwife-led antenatal breastfeeding educational programme on breastfeeding knowledge and self-efficacy, attitudes towards breastfeeding and perceived-barriers of breastfeeding. This was a quasi-experimental study with two study groups: an intervention group (following a four-hour midwife-led antenatal breastfeeding programme) and a control group. All nulliparous women attending antenatal care at the tertiary hospital in Athens, Greece during May 2016\u2013January 2017 were invited to participate, of which 203 nulliparous pregnant women took part. Demographic data forms, the Breastfeeding Self-efficacy Scale, the Iowa Infant Feeding Attitude Scale, the Breast Feeding Knowledge Questionnaire and the Perceived Breast Feeding Barriers Questionnaire were used for data collection. Post-intervention, women in the intervention group had a more positive attitude towards breastfeeding (73.5% versus 66.1%, p<0.001), greater knowledge (14.6% versus 13.1%, p<0.001) and more breastfeeding self-efficacy (51.4% versus 45.6%, p<0.001) compared to the control group. Furthermore, they had significantly less perceived barriers regarding breastfeeding (27.4% versus 31.0%, p<0.001). The four-hour antenatal breastfeeding education intervention which occurred and was evaluated for the first time in the Greek female population was effective in increasing breastfeeding knowledge, self-efficacy and a positive attitude towards breastfeeding. The intervention was furthermore effective in lowering perceived breastfeeding barriers. This midwife-led antenatal breastfeeding education programme could be suitable for integration to routine antenatal care in health care services in Greece.",

Anorectic effects of natural toxins were compared in the mouse. Parenteral and oral T-2 and HT-2 toxin exposure caused prolonged anorexia. Emetine was more potent when delivered orally as compared to parenterally. Emetine's effects were less than T-2 and HT-2 toxin and more transient. Parental and intranasal delivery satratoxin G caused transient anorectic effects. Trichothecene mycotoxins, potent translational inhibitors that are associated with human food poisonings and damp-building illnesses, are of considerable concern to animal and human health. Food refusal is a hallmark of exposure of experimental animals to deoxynivalenol (DON) and other Type B trichothecenes but less is known about the anorectic effects of foodborne Type A trichothecenes (e.g., T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin), airborne Type D trichothecenes (e.g., satratoxin G [SG]) or functionally analogous metabolites that impair protein synthesis. Here, we utilized a well-described mouse model of food intake to compare the anorectic potencies of T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin, and SG to that of emetine, a medicinal alkaloid derived from ipecac that inhibits translation. Intraperitoneal (IP) administration with T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin, emetine and SG evoked anorectic responses that occurred within 0.5\u00a0h that lasted up to 96, 96, 3 and 96\u00a0h, respectively, with lowest observed adverse effect levels (LOAELs) being 0.1, 0.1, 2.5 and 0.25\u00a0mg/kg BW, respectively. When delivered via natural routes of exposure, T-2 toxin, HT-2 toxin, emetine (oral) and SG (intranasal) induced anorectic responses that lasted up to 48, 48, 3 and 6\u00a0h, respectively with LOAELs being 0.1, 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5\u00a0mg/kg BW, respectively. All four compounds were generally much more potent than DON which was previously observed to have LOAELs of 1 and 2.5\u00a0mg/kg BW after IP and oral dosing, respectively. Taken together, these anorectic potency data will be valuable in discerning the relative risks from trichothecenes and other translational inhibitors of natural origin.",

    "abstract": "In mental diseases, the brain does not systematically adjust motor activity to feeding. Probably, the most outlined example is the association between hyperactivity and anorexia in Anorexia nervosa . The neural underpinnings of this \u2018paradox', however, are poorly elucidated. Although anorexia and hyperactivity prevail over self-preservation, both symptoms rarely exist independently, suggesting commonalities in neural pathways, most likely in the reward system. We previously discovered an addictive molecular facet of anorexia, involving production, in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), of the same transcripts stimulated in response to cocaine and amphetamine (CART) upon stimulation of the 5-HT 4 receptors (5-HTR 4 ) or MDMA (ecstasy). Here, we tested whether this pathway predisposes not only to anorexia but also to hyperactivity. Following food restriction, mice are expected to overeat. However, selecting hyperactive and addiction-related animal models, we observed that mice lacking 5-HTR 1B self-imposed food restriction after deprivation and still displayed anorexia and hyperactivity after ecstasy. Decryption of the mechanisms showed a gain-of-function of 5-HTR 4 in the absence of 5-HTR 1B , associated with CART surplus in the NAc and not in other brain areas. NAc-5-HTR 4 overexpression upregulated NAc-CART, provoked anorexia and hyperactivity. NAc-5-HTR 4 knockdown or blockade reduced ecstasy-induced hyperactivity. Finally, NAc-CART knockdown suppressed hyperactivity upon stimulation of the NAc-5-HTR 4 . Additionally, inactivating NAc-5-HTR 4 suppressed ecstasy's preference, strengthening the rewarding facet of anorexia. In conclusion, the NAc-5-HTR 4 /CART pathway establishes a \u2018tight-junction' between anorexia and hyperactivity, suggesting the existence of a primary functional unit susceptible to limit overeating associated with resting following homeostasis rules.",

    "abstract": "Eating Disorders (ED) are defined as abnormal eating behaviors, stemming from an obsession with food, body weight, or body shape. EDs affect 10 million men and 20 million women in the US, with an estimated 15% lifetime prevalence among women. An ED diagnosis is often accompanied with a host of adverse physical and mental health outcomes, including a heightened risk for suicidality. Given the complex comorbidities associated with EDs, treatment occurs in inpatient and outpatient settings. This study used linked administrative and health records from the Utah Population Database to create a cohort of women n =\u00a04183 and men n =\u00a0423 who had a known diagnosis of ED between 1995 and 2015. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to model ED-related hospitalization trajectories, including subsequent risk for suicidality/self-injurious behavior-related hospitalization. To better estimate the risk profiles associated with different health care utilization patterns, models explored how family-related life course events (childbirth, marriage transitions) and sociodemographic characteristics (race, sex, and median income at census-block) modify hospitalization trajectories following initial diagnosis. Results suggested that increased outpatient treatment was associated with reduced risk of initial ED-related hospitalization, but higher risk for subsequent ED-related hospital readmission. In addition, transition to marriage (i.e., getting married) was associated with reduced risk of ED-related and suicidality/self-injurious behavior-related hospitalizations (initial hospitalization and subsequent readmission). Increased number of children was only associated with reduced risk of initial ED-hospitalization, but not readmission. When assessing individuals' risk for ED-related hospitalizations, social and health services researchers should contextualize treatment trajectories within the individual's life experiences, particularly marital transitions, while simultaneously considering sociodemographic characteristics and utilization of outpatient care. Future research should further examine whether marriage represents an important turning point in the health trajectories of individuals with EDs. \u2022 Childbearing reduces risk of initial eating disorder hospitalization. \u2022 Marriage reduces risk of eating disorder hospitalization and readmission. \u2022 Marriage reduces risk of suicidality hospitalization for persons with prior eating disorder. \u2022 Higher outpatient treatment reduces risk of initial eating disorder hospitalization. \u2022 Higher outpatient treatment increases risk of eating disorder hospital readmission. Childbearing reduces risk of initial eating disorder hospitalization. Marriage reduces risk of eating disorder hospitalization and readmission. Marriage reduces risk of suicidality hospitalization for persons with prior eating disorder. Higher outpatient treatment reduces risk of initial eating disorder hospitalization. Higher outpatient treatment increases risk of eating disorder hospital readmission.",

    "abstract": "Instituting interventions during the prenatal period is optimal for early obesity prevention in the child. Healthy Eating Active Living (HEAL) is a six-week, multi-component program to promote breastfeeding, healthy dietary habits, cooking skills and physical activity among Medicaid-eligible pregnant-women in Texas. HEAL is integrated into the healthcare system and offered as a standard-of-care for eligible patients. Methods: Preliminary evaluation of this natural experiment conducted from March 2015 through October 2016 informs the initial feasibility, acceptability and effects of the program on participant diet, home nutrition environment, physical activity, and breastfeeding self-efficacy and intentions measured using self-report surveys. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted to evaluate pre- and post-intervention changes, controlling for participants' ethnicity, age, and income level. Interaction effects of session attendance on the outcomes were further assessed. Results: Of the 329 women who enrolled in HEAL, 210 women completed the pre-post assessment (64% retention rate). Pre-to-post intervention, there were significant increases in availability and intake of fruits and vegetables, self-efficacy towards consuming more fruits and vegetables, and cooking frequency and skills ( p <\u202f0.05), and decreased frequency of eating heat and serve foods ( p <\u202f0.05). Significant improvements in physical activity, duration of breastfeeding, perceived benefits and intentions to breastfeed were also observed (p\u202f<\u202f0.05). Higher attendance of HEAL sessions was associated with better outcomes. Process evaluation demonstrated 95% fidelity of program implementation. Conclusion: HEAL operationalizes clinic-community linkages and shows promise in improving behaviors during pregnancy. Future research warrants the use of a stringent study design with a control group to determine program efficacy.",

Infants were classified into 2 groups; 161 breast-fed infants and the same number of non-breast-fed infants. Microscopic examinations of stool were done for detection of parasites and measuring the intensity of infection. Moreover, serum levels of IgE and TNF-\u03b1 were measured by ELISA. Cryptosporidium spp., Entamoeba histolytica/Entamoeba dispar , Giardia lamblia , and Blastocystis sp. were demonstrated in infants with persistent diarrhea. The percentage of protozoan infections was significantly lower in breast-fed infants than that in the non-breast-fed infants. The levels of IgE and TNF-\u03b1 were significantly lower in the breast-fed group than in the non-breast-fed group. There were significant positive associations between the serum levels of IgE and TNF-\u03b1 and the intensity of parasite infection in the breast-fed group. It is suggested that breast-feeding has an attenuating effect on the rate and intensity of parasite infection.",

    "abstract": "Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody that interrupts interleukin-6 signalling, reducing downstream effects on inflammation and the innate immune response. It was shown to reduce mortality in patients with severe or critical coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Pregnant and breastfeeding people were largely excluded from clinical trials and hence, the extent to which results can be applied to these populations is not clear. To synthesize published data on tocilizumab in pregnancy and lactation, highlight important knowledge gaps, and help inform clinical decision-making about tocilizumab's use in these populations with COVID-19. PubMed was searched for studies evaluating tocilizumab in pregnancy and lactation for COVID-19 and other indications. Literature on pharmacokinetics and reproductive/fetal safety of monoclonal antibodies in general was also sought. The US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency guidance for the industry and regulatory approval documents were reviewed. Published data on tocilizumab in pregnancy include 610 cases ( n =\u00a020 with COVID-19) together with seven mother\u2013infant breastfeeding pairs. Higher rates of spontaneous abortion and premature birth have been reported compared with the general population, but multiple confounding variables limit interpretation. There is little data on tocilizumab exposure in the second and third trimesters when transplacental transport is highest. The effects of tocilizumab on the developing immune system are unclear. Pregnant patients with COVID-19 who received tocilizumab were often critically ill and corticosteroid use was uncommon. Neonatal follow up was limited. Tocilizumab appears to be compatible with breastfeeding. Although the available data do not raise serious safety signals, they have significant limitations and are not sufficient to delineate the complete spectrum of potential adverse outcomes that may be associated with tocilizumab exposure during pregnancy and lactation. Diligent follow up and documentation of pregnancy outcomes will be important moving forward. A more effective regulatory framework to ensure equitable inclusion of pregnant people in research is clearly needed.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the contribution that unilateral thoracic sympathectomy in dominant side or two-stage bilateral thoracic sympathectomy can have as strategies to reduce the incidence of compensatory sweating after sympathectomy for palmar hyperhidrosis. This is a prospective, controlled, randomized multicenter trial of 200 participants with palmar hyperhidrosis, which will be randomized into two arms: (a) one-stage bilateral thoracic sympathectomy (control arm); or (b) unilateral thoracic sympathectomy in dominant side (intervention arm). At six months the participants submitted to unilateral procedure can make the contralateral surgery if they wanted it, creating a third group called two-stage bilateral sympathectomy. Participants will be evaluated for the degree of sweating by the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) and of quality of life questionnaires. 96 participants out of the 200 proposed have been included so far, with 48 participants randomized to each arm. From the sample 61 (63.5%) are female, with a mean age of 24 (20\u201332) years. There were exclusive palmar hiperhydrosis in 14 cases (14.5%), palmar and plantar hyperhidrosis in 36 (37.5%) cases, palmar and axillar hyperhidrosis in 12 (12,5%) cases and palmar-axillary-plantar hyperhidrosis in 34 (35,4%) cases. The age at the beginning of the disease was childhood (78%), with mean of time of disease 15 (11\u201322) years. If one or both hypothesis: (a) unilateral sympathectomy in dominant hand is a satisfactory treatment; b) two-stage bilateral sympathectomy causes less compensatory sweating than in one stage are confirmed there is a chance that surgical therapy for palmar hyperhidrosis can be changed for better. \u2022 Reducing compensatory sweating is the goal to improve outcomes after sympathectomy for palmar hyperhidrosis. \u2022 Unilateral sympathectomy in dominant side can be a strategy to decrease compensatory sweating. \u2022 Is it possible that bilateral sympathectomy in two-stages can cause less compensatory sweating than in one-stage?

Because intestinal macrophages are derived from recruitment and in situ differentiation of blood monocytes in the gut mucosa, we hypothesized that increased recruitment of monocytes to the intestine during NEC reduces the blood monocyte concentration, and that this fall in blood monocytes can be a useful biomarker for NEC. We reviewed medical records of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants treated for NEC, and compared them with a matched control group comprised of infants with feeding intolerance but no signs of NEC. Clinical characteristics and absolute monocyte counts (AMC) were recorded. Diagnostic accuracy of AMC values was tested using receiver-operator characteristics (ROC). We compared 69 cases and 257 controls (median 27 weeks, range 26\u201329 in both groups). In stage II NEC, AMC decreased from median 1.7 \u00d7 10 9 /L (interquartile range (IQR) 0.98\u20132.4) to 0.8 (IQR 0.62\u20132.1); p <0.05. In stage III NEC, monocyte counts decreased from median 2.1 \u00d7 10 9 /L (IQR 0.1.5\u20133.2) to 0.8 (IQR 0.6\u20131.9); p <0.05. There was no change in AMC in control infants. ROC of AMC values showed a diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve) of 0.76. In a given infant with feeding intolerance, a drop in AMC of >20% indicated NEC with sensitivity of 0.70 (95% CI 0.57\u20130.81) and specificity of 0.71 (95% CI 0.64\u20130.77). We have identified a fall in blood monocyte concentration as a novel biomarker for NEC in VLBW infants.",

The reported associated endocrine changes (adaptive and non-adaptive) include hypothalamic amenorrhea, a nutritionally acquired growth hormone resistance with low insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) secretion, relative hypercortisolemia, decreased leptin and insulin concentrations, and increased ghrelin, Peptide YY (PYY) and adiponectin secretion. The combined effect of malnutrition and endocrinopathy may have deleterious effects on multi-organs including bone, gonads, thyroid gland, and brain (neurocognition, anxiety, depression, and other psychopathologies). The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a kinase that in humans is encoded by the mTOR gene. Recent studies suggest an important role of mTOR complex in integration of nutrient and hormone signals to adjust energy homeostasis.

    "abstract": "Eating disorders are serious mental diseases that frequently appear in female athletes. They are abnormal eating behaviors that can be diagnosed only by strict criteria. Disordered eating, although also characterized as abnormal eating behavior, does not include all the criteria for diagnosing eating disorders and is therefore a way to recognize the problem in its early stages. It is important to identify factors to avoid clinical progression in this high-risk population. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to discuss critical information for the prevention of eating disorders in female athletes. This review discusses the major correlates for the development of an eating disorder. We also discuss which athletes are possibly at highest risk for eating disorders, including those from lean sports and female adolescent athletes. There is an urgent need for the demystification of myths surrounding body weight and performance in sports. This review includes studies that tested different prevention programs\u2019 effectiveness, and the majority showed positive results. Educational programs are the best method for primary prevention of eating disorders. For secondary prevention, early identification is essential and should be performed by preparticipation exams, the recognition of dietary markers, and the use of validated self-report questionnaires or clinical interviews. In addition, more randomized clinical trials are needed with athletes from multiple sports in order for the most reliable recommendations to be made and for some sporting regulations to be changed.",

    "abstract": "Commensality, eating together with others, is a major representation of human sociality. In recent time, environments around commensality have changed significantly due to rapid social changes, and the decline of commensality is perceived as a serious concern in many modern societies. This study employs a cross-cultural analysis of university students in two East Asian countries, and examines cross-cultural variations of perceptions and actual practices of commensality and solo-eating. The analysis was drawn from a free-list survey and a self-administrative questionnaires of university students in urban Korea and Japan. The free-listing survey was conducted with a small cohort to explore common images and meanings of commensality and solo-eating. The self-administrative questionnaire was developed based on the result of the free-list survey, and conducted with a larger cohort to examine reasons and problems of practices and associated behaviors and food intake. We found that Korean subjects tended to show stronger associations between solo-eating and negative emotions while the Japanese subjects expressed mixed emotions towards the practice of solo-eating. In the questionnaire, more Korean students reported they prefer commensality and tend to eat more quantities when they eat commensally. In contrast, more Japanese reported that they do not have preference on commensality and there is no notable difference in food quantities when they eat commensally and alone. Compared to the general Korean cohort finding, more proportion of overweight and obese groups of Korean subjects reported that they tend to eat more when they are alone than normal and underweight groups. This difference was not found in the overweight Japanese subjects. Our study revealed cross-cultural variations of perceptions and practices of commensality and solo-eating in a non-western setting.",

    "abstract": "The ladybird beetle Coccinella septempunctata (L.) is an important biocontrol agent of pests such as various aphid species. Despite being one of the most studied coccinellid species, many aspects of its foraging behavior are still not completely understood. This study focuses on the diel foraging behavior of C. septempunctata , investigating their olfactory orientation toward aphid\u2010infested plants, walking activity on plants and on the soil, and feeding rates. In the scotophase the ladybird beetles were significantly more attracted to the odor of aphid\u2010infested plants, on which they also showed considerably higher walking activity then on uninfested controls. Females were more prone to utilize olfactory cues when searching for prey and fed at higher rates than males; this shows that they are better adapted to nocturnal activity, as they require higher food intake. Coccinella septempunctata have the same feeding rate during the scotophase as in the photophase. Our study shows that C. septempunctata has the potential to forage in the scotophase if prey is abundant. The results support the hypothesis that volatiles of aphid\u2010infested plants can attract or arrest foraging adult ladybird beetles, even in the darkness, which makes a considerable contribution to efficient prey search and enhances feeding capacity.",

However, data from longitudinal data are limited. This study examined 17-year changes in energy and macronutrient intake across eating occasions in the 1946 British birth cohort. Data were obtained from the 1946 British birth cohort. Cohort members completed 5d-estimated diaries at ages 36 (1982), 43 (1989) and 53 years (1999). Data from subjects who provided dietary data at all three time points were analysed ( n =1253). Repeated-measures analysis of variance with post hoc Bonferroni's adjustment was used to examine changes in energy and macronutrient at breakfast, mid-morning, lunch, mid-afternoon, evening and extra meal slots between 1982 and 1999. Analyses were stratified by sex and social class. The proportion of energy and macronutrients consumed at lunch declined between 1982 and 1999, which was compensated by a greater intake in the mid-afternoon and evening. This trend was seen across sex and social class, although women and adults with a non-manual occupation reported greater energy, carbohydrate and non-starch polysaccharide intake at breakfast in 1982 and had a higher protein intake in the evening compared with men and adults with a manual occupation. The timing of energy and nutrient intake has shifted slightly over time, with a greater proportion of intake later in the day. The association between the observed sex and occupational social class differences in eating profiles and chronic disease warrants investigation.",

    "abstract": "The main factors influencing feeding competition among members of diurnal primate groups are the distribution, availability, and quality of food resources. Socioecological models predict that temporal availability of preferred resources, such as fruit, can influence intragroup feeding competition, which is expected to affect rates of agonism and intragroup spatial patterns. We evaluated the effects of temporal variation in fruit availability on the degree of frugivory (i.e., the proportion of time spent feeding on fruit in relation to total food consumption) and the effects of fruit availability and degree of frugivory on rates of agonistic interactions, and intragroup proximity in two wild groups of gray woolly monkeys ( Lagothrix lagotricha cana ) in southwestern Brazilian Amazonia. We recorded 227 agonistic interactions via the all occurrences method and 3549 records of spacing via scan sampling during an 8-mo field study from March to October 2017. We found that fruit availability showed a positive relationship with the woolly monkeys\u2019 degree of frugivory, which in turn showed a positive relationship with the rates of agonism. We also found that degree of frugivory positively affected intragroup proximity in periods of lower fruit availability, and that agonistic interactions and proximity covaried positively. Conversely, as the degree of frugivory increased, monkeys exhibited greater interindividual distances and, consequently, lower rates of agonism, consistent with lower levels of feeding competition in periods of higher fruit availability. Therefore, we suggest that intragroup contest competition for fruits is an important cost of group living even for generalized, opportunistic frugivorous primates, such as woolly monkeys.",

This randomised controlled trial included 206 participants assigned to control (n=101) or BLISS (n=105) groups. Both groups received standard midwifery and \u2018Well Child\u2019 care. BLISS participants received eight additional visits (from before birth to 9 months) providing education and support on the BLISS approach to complementary feeding (ie, BLW modified to increase iron intake). The primary outcome of the BLISS study (growth) has been previously reported. This paper reports the key prespecified secondary outcomes, iron intake and iron status. Intake of iron and key absorption modifiers were assessed using weighed 3-day diet records at 7 and 12 months.

Significant postoperative improvements were reported between mean preoperative scores compared to 1 week and 1 month scores of the BSES\u2010SF ( F  (2) = 212.3; P < .001), the I\u2010GERQ\u2010R ( F  (2) = 85.3; P < .001), and VAS pain scale ( F  (2) = 259.8; P < .001). Average breastmilk intake improved 155% from 3.0 (2.9) to 4.9 (4.5) mL/min ( P < .001). Surgical release of tongue\u2010tie/lip\u2010tie results in significant improvement in breastfeeding outcomes. Improvements occur early (1 week postoperatively) and continue to improve through 1 month postoperatively. Improvements were demonstrated in both infants with classic anterior tongue\u2010tie and less obvious posterior tongue\u2010tie. This study identifies a previously under\u2010recognized patient population that may benefit from surgical intervention if abnormal breastfeeding symptoms exist. 2c Laryngoscope , 127:1217\u20131223, 2017",

    "abstract": "Feeding problems are an important area of neonatal morbidity that requires attention. We defined the feeding milestones related to transition to per oral feeding among premature infants based on gestational (GA) and postmenstrual ages (PMA), and elucidated the co-morbidity variables affecting with these skills. Feeding progress was tracked during the first hospitalization in a retrospective study involving 186 infants. We measured the age at acquisition of first feedings, maximum gavage feedings and maximum oral feedings. Resource usage measures included the total length of hospital stay (LOS), duration of gavage tube and duration of respiratory support. Effects of perinatal and co-morbidity factors on the acquisition of feeding milestones were evaluated. ANOVA, t -test, Wilcoxon rank sum test, \u03c7 2 test, univariate and multivariate analysis, stepwise linear regression analysis and logistic regression analysis were applied as appropriate. Data were presented as mean\u00b1s.d., or as stated. P <0.05 was considered significant. We stratified the data into three groups based on GA at birth: <28.0 weeks (group-1), 28.0 to 32.0 weeks (group-2) and 32.0 to 35.0 weeks (group-3). Compared with group-3, group-1 needed four-fold more ventilation and five-fold more continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) duration (all P <0.001); whereas group-2 needed two-fold more CPAP duration. Age at first feed correlated with age at full gavage feedings and age at full oral feedings ( r =0.53 and r =0.71, both P <0.0001). Age at full gavage feedings correlated with age at full oral feedings ( r =0.81, P <0.0001). Univariate analysis was significant for GA age, hypotension, the effects of gastroesophageal reflux, and duration of ventilation and CPAP on the PMA at maximal oral feedings (all P <0.05); multivariate analysis for these variables was also significant ( R   2 =0.58, P <0.0001). The success rate for oral feedings at discharge accelerated with GA maturation and caffeine use; on the other hand, the need for respiratory support and management of positive blood culture were associated with failure rates ( P <0.05). Infants < 28 weeks GA have significant feeding delays with respect to initiation and progression to maximal gavage and oral feedings, as well as prolonged LOS. Infants >28 weeks GA attained successful feeding milestones by similar PMA. Specific aero-digestive co-morbidities significantly affected maximal oral feeding milestone. Delays in achieving maximum gavage and maximum oral feeding milestones suggest delays with the development of control and regulation of foregut motility.",

In the current study, we delivered the Healthy Body Image (HBI) intervention among Norwegian high school students and examined the effects on healthy lifestyle habits. The HBI intervention comprises three interactive workshops, with three overarching themes related to body image, social media literacy, and lifestyle. A total of 2446 boys (43%) and girls in grade 12 (mean age 16.8 years) from 30 high schools participated in this cluster-randomized controlled study. Schools were randomized to the HBI intervention or control study arm. Data on physical activity, eating habits, and sleep were collected at baseline, post intervention, and 3- and 12-month follow-up and analyzed using linear mixed regression models. The intervention had a minor negative effect on physical activity levels in boys at 12-month follow-up and short-term small-to-moderate positive effects on consumption of breakfast and fruit and vegetables, and sleep duration on school days. In future, the lack of satisfactorily long-term effects might be better addressed using a combination of cognitive and behavioral approaches to more optimally integrate positive embodiment and lifestyle changes in the daily life of adolescents.

Due to the great advancements in the field of medical science, these anomalies can today be corrected. However, it cannot be ignored that the parents of these patients may face psychological stress due to the cleft defects in the baby. Also, these conditions may cause financial difficulties to the parents and cause anxiety to the mother about the proper feeding of their infant. Feeding problems can range from excessive air intake to failure to thrive. As the management of such cases is lengthy and includes a multi-disciplinary team approach, it is the role of the Pediatrician/Pedodontist to educate the mother about the proper feeding techniques. In this article, we have reviewed and highlighted the various traditional and advanced devices and techniques which help in the successful management of these individuals.",

    "abstract": "The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is dynamically regulated by fasting and feeding cycles in the liver to promote protein and lipid synthesis while suppressing autophagy. However, beyond these functions, the metabolic response of the liver to feeding and insulin signaling orchestrated by mTORC1 remains poorly defined. Here, we determine whether ATF4, a stress responsive transcription factor recently found to be independently regulated by mTORC1 signaling in proliferating cells, is responsive to hepatic mTORC1 signaling to alter hepatocyte metabolism. ATF4 protein levels and expression of canonical gene targets were analyzed in the liver following fasting and physiological feeding in the presence or absence of the mTORC1 inhibitor, rapamycin. Primary hepatocytes from wild-type or liver-specific Atf4 knockout ( LAtf4 KO ) mice were used to characterize the effects of insulin-stimulated mTORC1-ATF4 function on hepatocyte gene expression and metabolism. Both unbiased steady-state metabolomics and stable-isotope tracing methods were employed to define mTORC1 and ATF4-dependent metabolic changes. RNA-sequencing was used to determine global changes in feeding-induced transcripts in the livers of wild-type versus LAtf4 KO mice. We demonstrate that ATF4 and its metabolic gene targets are stimulated by mTORC1 signaling in the liver, in a hepatocyte-intrinsic manner by insulin in response to feeding. While we demonstrate that de novo purine and pyrimidine synthesis is stimulated by insulin through mTORC1 signaling in primary hepatocytes, this regulation was independent of ATF4. Metabolomics and metabolite tracing studies revealed that insulin-mTORC1-ATF4 signaling stimulates pathways of nonessential amino acid synthesis in primary hepatocytes, including those of alanine, aspartate, methionine, and cysteine, but not serine. The results demonstrate that ATF4 is a novel metabolic effector of mTORC1 in the liver, extending the molecular consequences of feeding and insulin-induced mTORC1 signaling in this key metabolic tissue to the control of amino acid metabolism. \u2022 Hepatic mTORC1 activates ATF4 and its gene targets with physiological feeding. \u2022 Hepatic ATF4 induces genes involved in amino acid metabolism with feeding. \u2022 Insulin-mTORC1 signaling stimulates de novo nucleotide synthesis in hepatocytes. \u2022 mTORC1-ATF4 induces hepatocyte synthesis of alanine and aspartate, but not serine. \u2022 mTORC1-ATF4 stimulates flux into the methionine cycle and trans-sulfuration pathway.

The target of this study was to investigate the particle-phase PAH composition of ambient samples in order to assess the influence of wood combustion on air quality in residential areas. PM 10 samples (particulate matter <10 \u03bcm) were collected during two winter seasons at two rural residential areas near Stuttgart in Germany. Samples were extracted using toluene in an ultrasonic bath and subsequently analysed by gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry. Twenty-one PAH compounds were detected and quantified. The PAH fingerprints of different wood combustion emissions were found in significant amounts in ambient samples and high correlations between total PAHs and other wood smoke tracers were found, indicating the dominant influence of wood combustion on air quality in residential areas. Carcinogenic PAHs were detected in high concentrations and contributed 49% of the total PAHs in the ambient air. To assess the health risk, we investigated the exposure profile of individual PAHs. The findings suggest that attention should be focused on using the best combustion technology available to reduce emissions from wood-fired heating during the winter in residential areas.",

This scoping review will help elucidate key elements affecting the developmental trajectory of communicative systems, typically robust and well-developed by formal school entry. We aim to (1) map the current state of the literature in a growing field of interest that has the potential to advance knowledge translation, (2) identify existing gaps and (3) provide research direction for future investigations surrounding feeding-swallowing functions and environment that support or forestall communication development in young children. We are proposing a scoping review to identify the breadth and depth of the existing literature regarding swallowing-feeding functions and environment relative to the onset and progression of communicative behaviours from infancy to 6 (<6;0) years of age. Our protocol delineates rigorous methods according to Arskey and O\u2019Malley\u2019s framework and includes elaborations by Levac and colleagues. We will search the literature based on 10 databases, 17 peer-reviewed journals, 4 conference proceedings and 6 grey literature sources. Two authors will independently screen abstracts and review full articles, remaining blind to each other\u2019s results. A third author will contribute to resolving any discrepant results from both the abstract and article review. Subsequently, we will extract data and chart information from accepted articles using a pre-established data collection form. We will stratify results according to healthy versus impaired swallowing-feeding functions and communication development. Our scoping review does not require ethical approval. We will disseminate our final study results through international and national conference presentations, publication in a peer-reviewed journal and knowledge translation activities with stakeholders.",

This study aimed to investigate the association between eating behaviors and hand grip strength in Chinese adults. We designed and conducted a cross-sectional study of 2009 Chinese individuals aged 25\u201365 years in 2017. Eating behaviors, including breakfast consumption, snacking after dinner, and eating rate, were assessed using a self-administered questionnaire. Hand grip strength was assessed using a digital grip dynamometer. Age, sex, BMI, physical activity, educational level, occupation, living status, sleep duration, smoking and drinking status, hypertension, diabetes, and depressive symptoms were used as confounding factors. After final adjustments for confounding factors, grip strength was measured as 35.2 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 34.7\u201335.8), 36.0 (95% CI: 35.6\u201336.4), and 36.9 (95% CI: 36.6\u201337.3) for those who skipped, occasionally ate, and regularly ate breakfast, respectively (p for trend <0.001).

In this study, we compared the growth pattern of formula-fed and breastfed infants living in Yasuj, southwest of Iran. Infants 7\u201314 months of age in southwest of Iran were classified as exclusively breastfed ( n = 200) and formula-fed ( n = 200) in their first 6 months of life. Growth velocity and Z -scores of weight for age, length for age, weight for length, and head circumference were estimated using WHO Anthro Plus software (2010) and SPSS Version 19 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) using World Health Organization reference for growth data. The study showed that Z -score of length for age and head circumference for age at the birth were significantly lower in formula-fed group than exclusively breastfed group ( P < 0.05), but the Z -score of weight for length did not differ significantly. At the sixth month of age, Z -score of weight for length was significantly higher in formula-fed group ( P < 0.05), but Z -score of length for age had no significant difference and Z -score of head circumference was higher in exclusively breastfed group yet ( P < 0.05). Growth velocity, prevalence of obesity, wasting, underweight, and stunting did not differ between two groups. Our findings suggest that formula feeding can lead to greater weight gain and may help the catch up of length, but evidences are not convincing enough to suggest the formula as an obesogenic feeding in the studied area. To make a conclusion, we suggest comparing the privileged and unprivileged areas and controlling for confounding variables including family hygiene and infant feeding practices between formula-fed and breastfed infants.",

    "abstract": "Some controversy surrounds the postoperative feeding regimen utilized in patients who undergo esophagectomy. Variation in practices during the perioperative period exists including the type of nutrition started, the delivery route, and its timing. Adequate nutrition is essential for this patient population as these patients often present with weight loss and have altered eating patterns after surgery, which can affect their ability to regain or maintain weight. Methods of feeding after an esophagectomy include total parenteral nutrition, nasoduodenal/nasojejunal tube feeding, jejunostomy tube feeding, and oral feeding. Recent evidence suggests that early oral feeding is associated with shorter LOS, faster return of bowel function, and improved quality of life. Enhanced recovery pathways after surgery pathways after esophagectomy with a component of early oral feeding also seem to be safe, feasible, and cost-effective, albeit with limited data. However, data on anastomotic leaks is mixed, and some studies suggest that the incidence of leaks may be higher with early oral feeding. This risk of anastomotic leak with early feeding may be heavily modulated by surgical approach. No definitive data is currently available to definitively answer this question, and further studies should look at how these early feeding regimens vary by surgical technique. This review aims to discuss the existing literature on the optimal route and timing of feeding after esophagectomy.",

    "abstract": "Outcome variables gauging the frequency of specific disordered eating behaviors (e.g., binge eating, vomiting) are common in the study of eating and health behaviors. The nature of such data presents several analytical challenges, which may be best addressed through the application of underutilized statistical approaches. The current study examined several approaches to predicting count-based behaviors, including zero-sensitive (i.e., zero-inflated and hurdle) regression models. Exploration of alternative models to predict eating-related behaviors occurred in two parts. In Part 1, participants (N = 524; 54% female) completed the Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire and Daily Stress Inventory. We considered the theoretical basis and practical utility of several alternative approaches for predicting the frequency of binge eating and compensatory behaviors, including ordinary least squares (OLS), logistic, Poisson, negative binomial, and zero-sensitive models. In Part 2, we completed Monte Carlo simulations comparing negative binomial, zero-inflated negative binomial, and negative binomial hurdle models to further explore when these models are most useful. Traditional OLS regression models were generally a poor fit for the data structure. Zero-sensitive models, which are not limited to traditional distribution assumptions, were preferable for predicting count-based outcomes. In the data presented, zero-sensitive models were useful in modeling behaviors that were relatively rare (laxative use and vomiting, 9.7% endorsed) along with those that were somewhat common (binge eating, 33.4% endorsed; driven exercise, 40.7% endorsed). Simulations indicated missing data, sample size, and the number of zeros may impact model fit. Zero-sensitive approaches hold promise for answering key questions about the presence and frequency of common eating-related behaviors and improving the specificity of relevant statistical models. Hurdle models may also be appropriate when theoretically justified.",

Exclusive nutrition on different communities is affected by different factors. This study aimed to determine continuous exclusive breastfeeding and some of the related factors. This was a descriptive-analysis prospective study. The study population included all the breastfed mothers admitted in the obstetrics wards of the selected hospitals. Selecting the hospitals also was done randomly. Data collection tools included a questionnaire completed by 291 mothers. To obtain the data about breastfeeding duration, mothers were phone called at the first and sixth postpartum months. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive and analytical statistics and software SPSS. Estimation of mean and standard deviation of exclusive breastfeeding duration at the first and sixth months after the delivery, respectively, were 3.86 (0.55) and 23.67 (6.63) weeks. One month after the delivery, 93.1%, 6.2% and 0.7% of the mothers, respectively, had exclusive breastfeeding, breastfeeding with formula milk or other ingredients and discontinuation of breastfeeding; 6 months after the delivery, these values changed to 86.3, 12 and 1.7%, respectively. The most frequent period of breastfeeding discontinuation (6.9%) was related to 1-4 weeks. The results indicated that statistically there was a significant correlation between breastfeeding duration and age and the birth hospital. While the results of the study showed no association between breastfeeding duration and number of the children, duration of marriage, educational level and mothers\u2019 occupation. The findings of the present study represented a high continuous exclusive breastfeeding which perhaps was due to applied baby-friendly hospitals strategies. Furthermore, to prevent from discontinuation of exclusive breastfeeding, knowing the discontinuation time and its related factors, particularly the first four postpartum weeks, can increase the knowledge of the health staff about counseling and education.",

    "abstract": "To study whether breastfeeding and breastfeeding status during gluten introduction influences the age at diagnosis of celiac disease (CD). In addition to study, whether the timing of gluten introduction influences the age at diagnosis of CD. It was a hospital based observational study. Total 198 patients diagnosed with CD as per modified European Society of Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (2012) criteria, aged between 6 months to 6 years were included. Detail history taken with special emphasis on breastfeeding and age of gluten introduction. Standard statistical methods used to analyze the data. Mean\u00b1standard deviation age of onset and diagnosis of CD in breastfed cases was 2.81\u00b11.42 years and 3.68 \u00b11.55 years respectively as compared to 1.84\u00b11.36 years and 2.70\u00b11.65 years respectively in not breastfed cases ( p <0.05). Those who had continued breastfeeding during gluten introduction and of longer duration had significantly delayed onset of disease. The age at onset of CD was under one year in 40.42% of the cases, who had started gluten before 6 months of age compared to only 12.58% of those who had started gluten later ( p <0.001). The proposed statistical model showed that two variables, i.e., breast feeding status during gluten introduction and age at gluten introduction positively influencing the age at diagnosis of CD. Delayed gluten introduction to infant's diet along with continuing breastfeeding, delays symptomatic CD. However, it is not clear from our study that these infant feeding practices provide permanent protection against the disease or merely delays the symptoms.",

We accepted hemoglobin values below 12 g/dl for girls and 13 g/dl for boys as the criteria of anemia. We recorded a detailed history including nutritional habits, consumption of animal source foods especially red meat, consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables, presence of parasitic infestation, psychosocial status, school success and any materials consumed except ordinary food. We investigated the prevalence of anemia in 1120 children (672 girls and 448 boys), aged 12 to 16 years. We found that the overall prevalence of anemia was 5.6%. 8.3% of the girls and 1.6% of the boys were anemic. We diagnosed iron deficiency anemia in 37(59%) anemic patients and combined iron deficiency and vitamin B12 deficiency anemia in 26 (41%) anemic patients. None of the patients had folic acid deficiency. Our results suggest that the socioeconomic status of the family, traditional eating habits of the region, the fear of gaining weight and irregular eating habits are of great importance in the development of adolescent anemia in Denizli.",

To investigate the validity and reliability of the Neonatal Feeding Assessment Scale (NFAS) in comparison to the modified barium swallow study (MBSS) as gold standard. A within-subject design was implemented. A group of 48 late premature neonates (mean gestational age 35.5 weeks) were sampled in the neonatal intensive care unit. The NFAS consists of six subsections, including physiological stability, infant state, stress cues, screening of muscle tone and control, oral peripheral examination and feeding/swallowing assessment. 93% of participants (14/15) received confirmatory diagnosis of OPD on MBSS. The NFAS presented with high sensitivity (78.6%) and specificity (88.2%) scores. The positive predictive value was 78.6%. Subsequently the accuracy of the NFAS to identify the presence of OPD accurately was 85.4% when compared to MBSS. Inter-rater reliability was determined on 35% of the sample. The inter-rater agreement on overall instrument outcome was substantial beyond chance. The NFAS may be of use to clinicians to support the early identification of OPD in this population, especially in resource constrained settings working without access to MBSS and to reach under served neonates.",

It is less known that motion sickness also affects thermoregulation, and the purpose of this review is to present and discuss existing data related to this subject. Hypothermia during seasickness was firstly noted nearly 150\u00a0years ago, but detailed studies of this phenomenon were conducted only during the last 2 decades. Motion sickness-induced hypothermia is philogenetically quite broadly expressed as besides humans, it has been reported in rats, musk shrews and mice. Evidence from human and animal experiments indicates that the physiological mechanisms responsible for the motion sickness-induced hypothermia include cutaneous vasodilation and sweating (leading to an increase of heat loss) and reduced thermogenesis. Together, these results suggest that motion sickness triggers highly coordinated physiological response aiming to reduce body temperature. Finally, we describe potential adaptive role of this response, and describe the benefits of using it as an objective measure of motion sickness-induced nausea.",

    "abstract": "Numerous studies have demonstrated attentional control difficulties and high avoidance coping in patients with anorexia nervosa. Attention is a critical coping resource because it enables individuals to demonstrate self-control and complete goal-directed behaviours. We aimed to examine whether attentional control difficulty is related to high avoidance coping, and investigate the neural underpinnings of attentional control difficulties in individuals with anorexia nervosa. Twenty-three patients with anorexia nervosa and 17 healthy controls completed questionnaires that assessed attention and coping, and underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing a go/no-go task. Patients with anorexia nervosa showed weaker attentional control, higher omission error rates and higher avoidance coping compared with healthy controls. Attentional control difficulty was associated with higher avoidance coping in both groups. Functional magnetic resonance imaging analysis showed less deactivation in regions representing internal mental processing, such as the praecuneus, cuneus and left lingual gyrus, during the no-go condition. Moreover, weakened deactivation of the left lingual gyrus was associated with higher commission error rate in the anorexia nervosa group. Our results suggest that patients with anorexia nervosa may have difficulty in maintaining attention to external ongoing events because of disturbance from internal self-related thought, and support the notion that attentional control difficulties underlie the frequent use of avoidance coping in anorexia nervosa.",

We assessed whether breastfeeding and early infection were associated with the risk of developing AL in children with DS. Children with DS in Mexico City, and either with or without AL, were the cases ( N =57) and controls ( N =218), respectively. Population was divided in children with AL and with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and also in children \u2a7d6 and >6 years old. Breastfeeding and early infections showed moderate (but not significant) association for AL, whereas hospitalisation by infection during the first year of life increased the risk: odds ratios (confidence interval 95%) were 0.84 (0.43\u20131.61), 1.70 (0.82\u20133.52); and 3.57 (1.59\u20138.05), respectively. A similar result was obtained when only ALL was analysed. We found that breastfeeding was a protective factor for developing AL and ALL, and during the first year of life, infections requiring hospitalisation were related to a risk for developing the disease in those children with DS >6 years of age. These data do not support the Greaves's hypothesis of early infection being protective for developing ALL.",

    "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa is a disease involving eating disorders. It mainly affects young people, especially teenage women. The disease is often latent and occurs in many sub-clinical and partial forms. Approximately from 0.3% to 1% of the population suffers from anorexia. It has been shown that patients with anorexia develop neurotransmitter-related disorders, leading to uncontrolled changes in the immune and endocrine systems. Interactions between cytokines, neuropeptides, and neurotransmitters play an important role in disease development. Significant malnutrition induces disorders and alterations in T-cell populations. The cellular response in patients with anorexia nervosa has been shown to be normal, although opinions on this issue are controversial. Laboratory studies on neutrophils in anorexia patients showed decreased adhesion and reduced bactericidal and cell activities. Despite such unfavourable results, patients with anorexia are resistant to infections, which are very rare in this group. Glutamine improves the performance of the human immune system. The administration of glutamine to anorexia patients, as a supplement to parenteral nutrition, has resulted in significant improvements in immune system parameters. The results of previous studies on the causes and risk factors in the development of anorexia nervosa are still ambiguous. One can hope that the differences and similarities between patients with anorexia nervosa and those with other forms of protein-calorie malnutrition may be helpful in determining the relationship between nutritional status and body defences and susceptibility to infection, and can help to broaden the knowledge about the aetiopathogenesis of anorexia nervosa.",

In a single-blinded randomized controlled trial (TCTR20181202001), 148 singleton pregnant women undergoing elective C-sections with regional anesthesia were assigned to receive either EOF or LOF. Participants began to sip water at 6\u20138\u00a0hrs or more than 12\u00a0hrs post-operation, for EOF or LOF respectively. Participants were then placed onto a stepping diet as tolerated. Participants failing to tolerate the stepping diet or those having surgical complications were excluded from the study. After exclusion, 69 women remained in the EOF group and 67 in the LOF group. The ages of participants ranged from 19 to 42, with a mean of 32.07. There was no-loss follow up and no significant difference in patient characteristics, except the site of the surgical incision. Participants given EOF were more likely to experience bowel sound the next morning than patients given LOF (EOF 87.0%, LOF 44.8%, P -value<0.001). However, there was no difference in time to passing flatus and time to passing stool. Maternal satisfaction regarding hunger (EOF 3.78\u00b10.91, LOF 3.24\u00b11.01, P -value 0.002) and maternal satisfaction with postoperative consumption (EOF 4.38\u00b10.64, LOF 4.13\u00b10.48, P -value 0.049) were significantly higher in the EOF group. There was no difference in gastrointestinal complications between the groups ( P -value 0.978). The EOF group experienced an earlier return of bowel movement and greater maternal satisfaction than the LOF group, with no difference in gastrointestinal complications. These findings support the recommendation of EOF for women who undergo uncomplicated C-sections under regional anesthesia.",

The World Health Organization recommends an early initiation of breastfeeding within one hour of birth and exclusive breastfeeding for 6 months to combat killer diseases such as diarrheal diseases, pneumonia, and obesity. On the other hand, complementary feeding is recommended with increase in the diversity, quantity, consistency and frequency as the child gets older along with continued breastfeeding for 12 months. Inappropriate complementary feeding is one of the major causes of malnutrition in children under the age of 5 years. Hence, appropriate guidance should be given to caregivers and health-care workers to help them promote the healthy growth of infants and young children.",

The likelihood of co-feeding transmission increases with duration of attachment of the infecting tick. Co-feeding transmission becomes less efficient as distance from the infecting tick increases. Approximately 6 times as many ticks acquire infection when feeding on infected mice than when co-feeding with infected ticks. Both subadult stages of the wood tick Ixodes ricinus infrequently co-infest mice and voles in nature; on approximately 1 in 20 small rodents, larvae co-feed with spirochete-infected nymphs. Because only 1 in 100 larvae in nature appear to acquire spirochetal infection when co-feeding with infected nymphs, perpetuation of B. afzelii depends largely on horizontal transmission of such pathogens from previously infected mice to noninfected larvae.",

Cows were assigned to either restricted feeding (30% of total digestible nutrient requirement) or ad libitum feeding of a dent corn-based concentrate and roughage for a 2-week feeding trial (Day 1=day of beginning the feeding trial). On day 14, a high-dose E 2 administration study was carried out to examine plasma E 2 levels as an indicator of hepatic E 2 metabolism. Plasma E 2 concentration in the restricted feeding group was consistently higher after high-dose E 2 administration than in the control group. In addition, indocyanine green half-life value was prolonged by restricted feeding for 13 days, and increased liver triglyceride concentration and decreased liver UGT activity were caused by this restriction over 14 days. Restricted feeding did not affect plasma IGF-1 concentration or hepatic IGF-1 mRNA expression. These results suggest that two weeks of restriction feeding led to accumulation of triglyceride, decreased liver blood flow, and slightly impaired liver function, which in turn slowed down the hepatic metabolism of E 2 without significantly impacting hepatic IGF-1 production.",

There was a significant positive correlation between negative perfectionism with symptoms of eating disorder, anorexia nervosa, and nervous longing to eat. The results also showed a significant negative relationship between body image and its dimensions with symptoms of eating disorder, anorexia nervosa, and neurasthenia.

    "abstract": "Eating disorders (EDs) are complex, multifactorial diseases linked to biological, developmental, psychological, and sociocultural factors. Medical students are among subjects at high risk of EDs. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate EDs among 710 Moroccan medical students with a focus on cognition and behavior related to EDs. Sociodemographic, economic, and clinical data were collected. Validated questionnaires, such as the SCOFF (Sick, Control, One Stone, Fat, Food) questionnaire and the Eating Disorder Inventory 2 (EDI2), were administered. The male:female ratio was 0.53, mean age was 21\u00b12 years, 11.1% of participants were underweight, 13.4% were overweight, and 1.8% were obese. A middle socioeconomic level was found in 84.9% of cases. The prevalence of EDs in students was 32.8% (37.6% among females and 23.7% among males) and that of weight-control behaviors 18.5%. Increased body-mass index values were significantly associated with dieting ( P <0.001), fasting ( P =0.044), and the use of appetite suppressants ( P =0.037). It appears that the impact of EDs is high, affecting a third of medical students, with significant use of harmful weight-control behaviors. We also found that dimensions of bulimia, perfectionism, body dissatisfaction, and ineffectiveness, parts of the core of EDs, were found in future medical practitioners.",

Male Wistar rats (90-days-old) were treated once a day with conventional or organic white grape juice by gavage for 14 days (7\u00a0\u03bcL/g). On the 15th day the rats received carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4 ) in a single dose of 3.0\u00a0mL/kg. Cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum were dissected to measure the activity of creatine kinase (CK) and pyruvate kinase (PK). No changes in feeding behavior were observed after the treatment with the grapes juices. However, there was an increase in grooming behavior in the open field test provoked by both juices. CCl 4 inhibited CK activity in cerebral cortex and hippocampus of the rats and CCl 4 also reduced PK activity in all brain structures studied. Furthermore, both white grape juices prevented the decrease in the activity of CK and PK. Therefore, we can suggest that organic and conventional white grape juices could restore the activity of enzymes with a central role in brain energy metabolism.",

The World Health Organization has recommended either exclusive replacement feeding or exclusive breastfeeding options for HIV-exposed infants for the first 6 months of life. The purpose of this study was to assess the factors associated with noncompliance with these recommendations among a population of HIV-infected mothers of young infants in Bahir Dar City, Amhara Regional State, Ethiopia. An institutional based cross-sectional study was conducted from March 1 to May 15, 2018. A structured interview was conducted with 213 HIV-positive mothers. Descriptive statistics were used to show the frequency distributions of factors associated with noncompliance with World Health Organization-recommended infant-feeding practices. Both bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the variables predictive of infant-feeding practices. All mothers were undergoing antiretroviral therapy. Only 83.5% claimed to be following World Health Organization-recommended infant-feeding practices. Bivariate analysis showed that high school or greater educational status [Adjusted odds ratio (AOR)\u202f=\u202f3.6 (95% CI = 4.2, 9.5)], having attended antenatal visits [AOR\u202f=\u202f6.7 (95% CI = 5.6, 10.9)] and postnatal follow-up visits [AOR\u202f=\u202f6.9 (95% CI = 4.2, 9.3)], and disclosure of HIV status to their spouse [AOR\u202f=\u202f8.2 (95% CI = 6.2, 10.7)] were associated with adherence to recommended infant-feeding practices. The prevalence of recommended infant feeding practices among HIV-exposed infants in the study area was suboptimal compared with the \u226590% recommended by the World Health Organization. Higher educational status of the mother, antenatal and postnatal follow-ups, and disclosure of HIV status to spouses were predictors of adherence to the recommended infant-feeding practices. Although not yet proven in a prospective clinical trial, providing more education for women, improving attendance at antenatal and postnatal follow-up visits, encouraging the disclosure of HIV status to spouses, and educating mothers about proper infant-feeding options during follow-up visits may all be useful to increase compliance.",

    "abstract": "In December 2019, a new viral respiratory infection known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was first diagnosed in the city of Wuhan, China. COVID-19 quickly spread across the world, leading the World Health Organization to declare it a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The disease is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a similar virus to those involved in other epidemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Epidemiological studies have shown that COVID-19 frequently affects young adults of reproductive age and that the elderly and patients with chronic disease have high mortality rates. Little is known about the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy and breastfeeding. Most COVID-19 cases present with mild flu-like symptoms and only require treatment with symptomatic relief medications, whereas other cases with COVID-19 require treatment in an intensive care unit. There is currently no specific effective treatment for COVID-19. A large number of drugs are being used to fight infection by SARS-CoV-2. Experience with this therapeutic arsenal has been gained over the years in the treatment of other viral, autoimmune, parasitic, and bacterial diseases. Importantly, the search for an effective treatment for COVID-19 cannot expose pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 to the potential teratogenic risks of these drugs. Therefore, it is necessary to determine and understand the safety of anti-COVID-19 therapies prior to conception and during pregnancy and breastfeeding.",

For example, the Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI) is an ideal metric to assess the food quality of households, but the traditional methods of collecting the data required to calculate the HEI are expensive and burdensome. We evaluated an alternative source: rather than measuring the quality of the foods consumers eat, we want to estimate the quality of the foods consumers buy. To accomplish that we need a way of estimating the HEI based solely on the count of food items. We developed an estimation model of the HEI, using an augmented set of the What We Eat In America (WWEIA) food categories. Then we mapped ~92,000 grocery food items to it. The model uses an inverse Cumulative Distribution Function sampling technique. Here we describe the model and report reliability metrics based on NHANES data from 2003\u20132010.",

    "abstract": "Vulnerability to eating disorders (EDs) is broadly assumed to be associated with early life stress. However, a careful examination of the literature shows that susceptibility to EDs may depend on the type, severity and timing of the stressor and the sex of the individual. We aimed at exploring the link between chronic prenatal stress and predisposition to EDs and metabolic disease. We used a chronic variable stress protocol during gestation to explore the metabolic response of male and female offspring to food restriction (FR), activity-based anorexia (ABA), binge eating (BE) and exposure to high fat (HF) diet. Contrary to controls, prenatally stressed (PNS) female offspring showed resistance to ABA and BE and displayed a lower metabolic rate leading to hyperadiposity and obesity on HF diet. Male PNS offspring showed healthy responses to FR and ABA, increased propensity to binge and improved coping with HF compared to controls. We found that long-lasting abnormal responses to metabolic challenge are linked to fetal programming and adult hypothalamic dysregulation in PNS females, resulting from sexually dimorphic adaptations in placental methylation and gene expression. Our results show that maternal stress may have variable and even opposing effects on ED risk, depending on the ED and the sex of the offspring. \u2022 Prenatal stress programs the metabolic outcome of the offspring in a sex dependent manner. \u2022 Prenatal stress programs females to become overweight through hypothalamic abnormalities and inflammation. \u2022 Prenatal stress affects placental gene expression, causing inflammation and abnormal transfer of nutrients to the fetus.

    "abstract": "Coronaviruses have caused three global outbreaks in the last 20 years, which include Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) caused by SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-1), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) by MERS-CoV and Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) due to SARS-CoV-2. These outbreaks share many similarities, including clinical presentation, transmission, and management. Although respiratory manifestations are responsible for most of the morbidity and mortality in these conditions, extra-pulmonary manifestations such as gastrointestinal symptoms are also increasingly recognized as important symptoms. Important gastrointestinal symptoms include nausea, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Hepatic manifestations such as abnormal aminotransferases are also noted in these patients. Early identification of GI symptoms is crucial as some patients can present only with GI manifestations in the absence of pulmonary symptoms. Furthermore, patients with diarrhea have tested positive for viral RNA in the stool. This has been reported even after the resolution of respiratory symptoms and can extend up to many days from the onset of symptoms. Because of this phenomenon, there is a theoretical risk of fecal-oral transmission and the potential spread of the disease. Though GI symptoms are frequently observed, understanding the pathogenesis of these symptoms is crucial, as it can not only of public health importance but could also identify infected patients early in the spread. Understanding the different GI and hepatic manifestations with underlying mechanisms of symptoms can assist in the therapeutic management of these patients. In this article, we summarize various GI and hepatic manifestations with their prevalence, underlying pathophysiology with emphasis on stool positivity.",

Thus, the objective of this study was to explore how caregivers of infants under 6 months of age perceived changes to infant feeding and other food and health\u2010related matters during the COVID\u201019 State of Emergency in Nova Scotia, Canada. Four weeks after the State of Emergency began, between 17 April and 15 May 2020, caregivers completed this online survey, including the Perceived Stress Scale. Participants ( n = 335) were 99% female and mostly White (87%). Over half (60%) were breastfeeding, and 71% had a household income over CAD$60,000. Most participants (77%) received governmental parental benefits before the emergency, and 59% experienced no COVID\u201019\u2010related economic changes. Over three quarters of participants (77%) scored moderate levels of perceived stress. Common themes of concern included social isolation, COVID\u201019 infection (both caregiver and infant), and a lack of access to goods, namely, human milk substitutes (\u2018infant formula\u2019), and services, including health care, lactation support, and social supports. Most COVID\u201019\u2010related information was sought from the internet and social media, so for broad reach, future evidence\u2010based information should be shared via online platforms. Although participants were experiencing moderate self\u2010perceived stress and shared numerous concerns, very few COVID\u201019\u2010related changes to infant feeding were reported, and there were few differences by socio\u2010economic status, likely due to a strong economic safety net in this Canadian setting.",

In this report, we present a 12-year-old female who developed anorexia nervosa and was thereafter diagnosed with celiac disease. The latter diagnosis occurred after a 2-year period of persistent abdominal complaints and duodenal biopsies on three separate occasions. Our case highlights the diagnostic challenge, which may include initially missing the diagnosis, associated with celiac disease in patients who are restricting their nutritional intake, and also the importance of re-testing in patients where gastrointestinal complaints are persistent for extended time periods after refeeding.",

To prospectively explore the safety, feasibility and short-term clinical outcomes of early oral feeding after laparoscopic radical total gastrectomy for GC patients. This study was a prospective cohort study conducted between January 2018 and December 2019 based in a high-volume tertiary hospital in China. A total of 206 patients who underwent laparoscopic radical total gastrectomy for GC were enrolled. Of which, 105 patients were given early oral feeding (EOF group) after surgery, and the other 101 patients were given the traditional feeding strategy (control group) after surgery. Perioperative clinical data were recorded and analyzed. The primary endpoints were gastrointestinal function recovery time and postoperative complications, and the secondary endpoints were postoperative nutritional status, length of hospital stay and expenses, etc . Compared with the control group, patients in the EOF group had a significantly shorter postoperative first exhaust time (2.48 \u00b1 1.17 d vs 3.37 \u00b1 1.42 d, P = 0.001) and first defecation time (3.83 \u00b1 2.41 d vs 5.32 \u00b1 2.70 d, P = 0. 004). In addition, the EOF group had a significant shorter postoperative hospitalization duration (5.85 \u00b1 1.53 d vs 7.71 \u00b1 1.56 d, P < 0.001) and lower postoperative hospitalization expenses (16.60 \u00b1 5.10 K\u00a5 vs 21.00 \u00b1 7.50 K\u00a5, P = 0.014).

However, there was no significant difference in the incidence of total postoperative complications between the two groups ( P = 0.507). Early oral feeding after laparoscopic radical total gastrectomy can promote the recovery of gastrointestinal function, improve postoperative nutritional status, reduce length of hospital stay and expenses while not increasing the incidence of related complications, which indicates its safety, feasibility and potential benefits for gastric cancer patients.",

We assessed food intake microstructure and meal pattern, and locomotor activity and rearing as markers of food anticipatory activity (FAA). Schedule fed mice reduced their caloric intake from control diet during the first hours of the dark phase but not during the 3-h period immediately preceding the scheduled feed. Large meal/binge-like eating behaviour during the 2-h scheduled feed was characterised by increases in both meal number and meal size. Rearing was increased during the 2-h period running up to scheduled feeding while locomotor activity started to increase 1\u2009h before, indicating that schedule-fed mice display FAA. Meal number and physical activity changes were sustained when HFD was withheld during the anticipated scheduled feeding period, and mice immediately binged when HFD was represented after a week of this \u201cwithdrawal\u201d period. These findings provide important context to our previous studies suggesting that energy balance systems in the hypothalamus are not responsible for driving these large, binge-type meals. Evidence of FAA in HFD dark phase schedule-fed mice implicates anticipatory processes in binge eating that do not involve immediately preceding hypophagia or regulatory homeostatic signalling.",

A prospective cohort study was conducted, recruiting pregnant womenthrough two-stage cluster sampling. Their exclusive breastfeeding intention, attitude, perceived norm, perceived behavioral control and past behavior were obtained at baseline through interviewer-guided questionnaire. At one month after delivery, another interview was conducted to determine the two additional variables in the extended theory, which were their postpartum support and breastfeeding difficulty. The behavior, which was the actual duration of exclusive breastfeeding, was obtained from the second follow-up at six months. Pearson correlation and two hierarchical regression analyses were conducted. A total of 200 women completed the study follow-up. Their median intended exclusive breastfeeding duration was 4.0 (IQR 5) months, and the median actual duration was 1.0 (IQR 4) month. The Theory of Planned Behavior explained 51.0% of the variance in intention, with perceived behavioral control and attitude were the significant predictors. It also explained 10.0% of the variance in behavior, but the addition of postpartum support and breastfeeding difficulty increased the amount of explained variance in behavior by 6.0%. The significant predictors of exclusive breastfeeding behavior were intention, postpartum support and breastfeeding difficulty. The extended Theory of Planned Behaviorhad a good predictive ability in explaining exclusive breastfeedingintention and behavior. The women's intention to practice exclusive breastfeeding may be improved by improving their perceived behavioral control and attitude. Providing correct postpartum support and skills to handle breastfeeding difficulties after delivery will improve their exclusive breastfeeding behavior.",

    "abstract": "Coordinated, multidisciplinary treatment for women with eating disorders is consistently recommended as maximally effective, but few studies have considered the patient experience. This qualitative study examined the experiences of women receiving such care in an outpatient setting. Using an interpretive description methodology, we conducted 12 in-depth interviews with participants who were diagnosed with an eating disorder and were receiving team-based treatment. Patients uniformly advocated for the coordinated, multidisciplinary treatment approach. Analysis of participants\u2019 experiences yielded four categories: relying on the lifeline of communication, supporting autonomy, drawing on individual strengths, and valuing synergy. These findings build on previous research emphasizing the importance of autonomy support and connectedness in the recovery process from an eating disorder. Findings highlight the importance of nurses to support a multidisciplinary care approach to working with this patient population; these women\u2019s voices also support a treatment approach that, despite being widely recommended, is vastly understudied and underutilized.",

    "abstract": "To evaluate the seroprevalence against circumsporozoite protein (CSP) of Plasmodium vivax in sera of Korean patients, the central repeating domain (CRD) of CSP was cloned and analyzed. From the genomic DNA of patient's blood, 2 kinds of CSPs were identified to belong to a VK210 type, which is the dominant repeating of GDRA(D/A)GQPA, and named as PvCSPA and PvCSPB. Recombinantly expressed his-tagged PvCSPA or PvCSPB in Escherichia coli reacted well against sera of patients in western blot, with the detecting rate of 47.9% (58/121), which included 15 cases positive for PvCSPA, 6 cases positive for PvCSPB, and 37 cases for both. The mixture of PvCSPA and PvCSPB was loaded to a rapid diagnostic test kit (RDT) and applied with the same set of patient sera, which resulted in detection rates of 57.0% (69/121). When the protein sequences of PvCSPA were compared with those of P. vivax in endemic regions of India and Uganda, they were compatibly homologous to PvCSPA with minor mutations. These results suggested that the recombinant PvCSPA and PvCSPB loaded RDT may be a milestone in latent diagnosis which has been a hot issue of domestic malaria and important for radical therapy in overlapped infections with P. falciparum in tropical and subtropical areas. During the biological process of malarial infection, exposure of CSP to antigen-antibody reaction up to 57.0% is the first report in Korea.",

    "abstract": "To explore mothers\u2019 perceptions of differences between their children in the eating behaviour domain. Twelve semi-structured interviews were carried out with mothers who had at least two children aged between 6 and 15 years, to discuss feeding experiences, particularly around healthy eating. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim and analysed using Framework Analysis. Mothers frequently identified differences in appetite and food preferences between their children, which they attributed largely to genetic factors. These sibling differences meant that although feeding goals might be common, the pathways to the goals varied depending on each child\u2019s appetitive characteristics. The overall pattern was one of flexible responsiveness to each child. In contrast to perceptions of their own children\u2019s eating behaviours, feeding difficulties in other families were usually attributed to lack of parental control. The feeding relationship is complex and interactive, resulting in parents modulating their feeding strategies to match each child\u2019s eating behaviour. Guidance to parents on healthy feeding needs to acknowledge the nuanced and interactive nature of feeding practices.",

    "abstract": "Stress\u2010induced emotional eating is a risk factor for overweight and obesity. Previous research proposes both the human serotonin transporter gene ( 5\u2010HTTLPR ) and child's reactive temperament are promising candidates to help explain individual differences in stress\u2010induced emotional eating and weight. Understanding the association between specific genotypes, reactive temperament factors, and stress\u2010induced emotional eating may inform the development of personalized and effective treatment for children who may be at risk for overweight and obesity. The current study explored the conditional indirect effect of genetic and environmental susceptibility (i.e., the interaction between 5\u2010HTTLPR and reactive temperament) on weight (as measured by percent body fat) mediated by stress\u2010induced emotional eating. One hundred and forty\u2010seven children (4 to 6 years old; 50.3% female; 22.4% Hispanic), along with their primary caregiver, completed laboratory tasks and questionnaires that assessed the child's reactive temperament, stress\u2010induced emotional eating, and percent body fat. The interaction between 5\u2010HTTLPR and impulsivity as well as with negative affectivity significantly predicted percent body fat. The interaction between 5\u2010HTTLPR and impulsivity as well as with negative affectivity significantly predicted both total calorie consumption and rate of total calorie consumption. However, the mediation aspect of this statistical model was not supported. Child reactive temperament is an important indicator of how children approach eating when stressed. Mental health providers may consider prescribing strategies to reduce emotional eating among children with the SL variant and moderate to high impulsivity as well as children with the LL variant and high negative affectivity.",

We reviewed clinical data from the first 60 pregnant women with COVID\u201019 whose care was managed at Puerta de Hierro University Hospital, Madrid, Spain from March 14 th to April 14 th , 2020. Demographic data, clinical findings, laboratory test results, imaging findings, treatment received, and outcomes were collected. An analysis of variance (Kruskal\u2010Wallis test) was performed to compare the medians of laboratory parameters. Fisher's exact test was used to evaluate categorical variables. A correspondence analysis was used to explore associations between variables. A total of 60 pregnant women were diagnosed with COVID\u201019. The most common symptoms were fever and cough (75.5%, each) followed by dyspnea (37.8%). Forty\u2010one patients (68.6%) required hospital admission (18 due to disease worsening and 23 for delivery) of whom 21 patients (35%) underwent pharmacological treatment, including hydroxychloroquine, antivirals, antibiotics and tocilizumab. No renal or cardiac failures or maternal deaths were reported. Lymphopenia (50%), thrombocytopenia (25%), and elevated C\u2010reactive protein (CRP) (59%) were observed in the early stages of the disease. Median CRP, D\u2010dimer and the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio were elevated. High CRP and D\u2010dimer levels were the parameters most frequently associated with severe pneumonia. The Neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio was found to be the most sensitive marker for disease improvement (relative risk: 6.65; 95% CI: 4.1\u20105.9). During the study period, 18 of the women (78%) delivered vaginally. All newborns tested negative for SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 and none of them were infected during breastfeeding. No SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 was detected in placental tissue. Most of the pregnant COVID\u201019 positive patients had a favorable clinical course. However, one\u2010third of them developed pneumonia, of whom 5% presented a critical clinical status. CRP and D\u2010dimer levels positively correlated with severe pneumonia and the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio decreased as the patients improved clinically. Seventy\u2010eight percent of patients had a vaginal delivery. No vertical or horizontal transmissions were diagnosed in the neonates during labor or breastfeeding.",

Unilateral and bilateral amygdala cannulation was carried out, and after a week of recovery, 2% lidocaine hydrochloride was injected into the mice amygdalae five minutes before the induction of stress. A communication box was employed to induce stress for four consecutive days and plasma corticosterone, food and water intake, weight changes, and anorexia were measured as stress-induced metabolic changes. Results demonstrated that stress, increases stress, increased plasma corticosterone concentrations, weight, food, and water intake. Temporary inhibition of the amygdala slightly decreased plasma corticosterone concentrations, but did not fully reduce the effect of stress. The bilateral injection of lidocaine hydrochloride to the amygdala reduced the effect of stress and reduced water intake and weight. Unilateral injection of lidocaine hydrochloride into the left and right amygdala reduced food intake. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that the left side and right side of amygdala nuclei play a different role in metabolic responses in stress.",

The protocol included four in-person clinic visits for protocol instruction, blood draws, anthropometry, and meal testing; all other activities were done at home. Participants completed two 21-day phases in random order with a two-week washout between phases. One phase was high EF (6 eating occasions/day) and the other was low EF (3 eating occasions/day). Each phase specified time of day for each eating occasion. Participants prepared their own meals throughout the study using study-provided individualized, structured meal plans ensuring that calories, macronutrients and micronutrients were identical during both study phases. Fasting blood was collected before and after each phase to test intervention effects on the biomarkers. At the end of each phase participants also completed extended appetite testing with meals prepared by the study clinic. Participants were recruited using print, radio, and digital ads. 60 participants consented to enroll; 10 dropped out due to work or school scheduling conflicts and 50 (target sample size) completed the study. Compliance was assessed by completion of daily on-line meal plan checklists. The FRESH study will provide data on whether higher vs. lower daily EF in the context of constant energy and nutrient intake may be harmful or beneficial based on intervention effects on biomarkers of health and disease risk.",

To investigate the effects of different goal caloric requirements of enteral nutrition on the gastrointestinal function and outcomes in the acute phase of sepsis. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 30% (defined as group A), 60% (group B), or 100% (group C) of goal caloric requirements of enteral nutrition in this prospective pilot clinical trial. The acute gastrointestinal injury (AGI) grades, incidence of feeding intolerance (FI), daily caloric intake, nutritional and inflammatory markers, and biomarkers of mucosal barrier function were collected during the first 7 d of enteral feeding. The clinical severity and outcome variables were also recorded. A total of 54 septic patients were enrolled. The days to goal calorie of group C (2.55 \u00b1 0.82) were significantly longer than those of group A (3.50 \u00b1 1.51; P = 0.046) or B (4.85 \u00b1 1.68; P < 0.001). The FI incidence of group C (16.5%) was higher than that of group A (5.0%) or B (8.7%) ( P = 0.009). No difference in the incidence of FI symptoms was found between groups A and B. The serum levels of barrier function biomarkers of group B were significantly lower than those of group A ( P < 0.05) on the 7th day of feeding. The prealbumin and IL-6 levels of group A were lower than those of group B ( P < 0.05) on the 7 th day of feeding. No significant differences in the clinical outcome variables or 28-d mortality were found among the three groups. Early moderate enteral underfeeding (60% of goal requirements) could improve the intestinal barrier function and nutritional and inflammatory status without increasing the incidence of FI symptoms in sepsis. However, further large-scale prospective clinical trials and animal studies are required to test our findings. Moreover, the effects of different protein intake on gastrointestinal function and outcomes should also be investigated in future work.",

Covariates included sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle risk factors, and medical and reproductive history. There were 3428 (3.4%) first CVD \u2010related hospital admissions and 418 (0.4%) deaths during a mean follow\u2010up time of 6.1\u00a0years for CVD hospitalization and 5.7\u00a0years for CVD mortality. Ever breastfeeding was associated with lower risk of CVD hospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio [95% CI]: 0.86 [0.78, 0.96]; P =0.005) and CVD mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [95% CI]: 0.66 [0.49, 0.89]; P =0.006) compared with never breastfeeding. Breastfeeding \u226412\u00a0months/child was significantly associated with lower risk of CVD hospitalization. Breastfeeding is associated with lower maternal risk of CVD hospitalization and mortality in middle\u2010aged and older Australian women. Breastfeeding may offer long\u2010term maternal cardiovascular health benefits.",

    "abstract": "Breastfeeding rates are suboptimal internationally, and many infants are not receiving any breast milk at all by six months of age. Few interventions increase breastfeeding duration, particularly where there is relatively high initiation. The effect of proactive peer (mother-to-mother) support has been found to increase breastfeeding in some contexts but not others, but if it is shown to be effective would be a potentially sustainable model in many settings. We aimed to determine whether proactive telephone-based peer support during the postnatal period increases the proportion of infants being breastfed at six months of age. RUBY (Ringing Up about Breastfeeding earlY) was a multicentre, two-arm un-blinded randomised controlled trial conducted in three hospitals in Victoria, Australia. First-time mothers intending to breastfeed were recruited after birth and prior to hospital discharge, and randomly assigned (1:1) to usual care or usual care plus proactive telephone-based breastfeeding support from a trained peer volunteer for up to six months postpartum. A computerised random number program generated block sizes of four or six distributed randomly, with stratification by site. Research midwives were masked to block size, but masking of allocation was not possible. The primary outcome was the proportion of infants receiving any breast milk at six months of age. Analyses were by intention to treat; data were collected and analysed masked to group. The trial is registered with ACTRN, number 12612001024831. Women were recruited between Feb 14, 2013 and Dec 15, 2015 and randomly assigned to peer support ( n =\u202f574) or usual care ( n =\u202f578). Five were not in the primary analysis [5 post-randomisation exclusions]. Infants of women allocated to telephone-based peer support were more likely than those allocated to usual care to be receiving breast milk at six months of age (intervention 75%, usual care 69%; Adj. RR 1\u00b710; 95% CI 1\u00b702, 1\u00b718). There were no adverse events. Providing first time mothers with telephone-based support from a peer with at least six months personal breastfeeding experience is an effective intervention for increasing breastfeeding maintenance in settings with high breastfeeding initiation.

    "abstract": "Functional, molecular and genetic neuroimaging has highlighted the existence of brain anomalies and neural vulnerability factors related to obesity and eating disorders such as binge eating or anorexia nervosa. In particular, decreased basal metabolism in the prefrontal cortex and striatum as well as dopaminergic alterations have been described in obese subjects, in parallel with increased activation of reward brain areas in response to palatable food cues. Elevated reward region responsivity may trigger food craving and predict future weight gain. This opens the way to prevention studies using functional and molecular neuroimaging to perform early diagnostics and to phenotype subjects at risk by exploring different neurobehavioral dimensions of the food choices and motivation processes. In the first part of this review, advantages and limitations of neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), pharmacogenetic fMRI and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) will be discussed in the context of recent work dealing with eating behavior, with a particular focus on obesity. In the second part of the review, non-invasive strategies to modulate food-related brain processes and functions will be presented. At the leading edge of non-invasive brain-based technologies is real-time fMRI (rtfMRI) neurofeedback, which is a powerful tool to better understand the complexity of human brain\u2013behavior relationships. rtfMRI, alone or when combined with other techniques and tools such as EEG and cognitive therapy, could be used to alter neural plasticity and learned behavior to optimize and/or restore healthy cognition and eating behavior. Other promising non-invasive neuromodulation approaches being explored are repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS). Converging evidence points at the value of these non-invasive neuromodulation strategies to study basic mechanisms underlying eating behavior and to treat its disorders. Both of these approaches will be compared in light of recent work in this field, while addressing technical and practical questions. The third part of this review will be dedicated to invasive neuromodulation strategies, such as vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) and deep brain stimulation (DBS). In combination with neuroimaging approaches, these techniques are promising experimental tools to unravel the intricate relationships between homeostatic and hedonic brain circuits. Their potential as additional therapeutic tools to combat pharmacorefractory morbid obesity or acute eating disorders will be discussed, in terms of technical challenges, applicability and ethics. In a general discussion, we will put the brain at the core of fundamental research, prevention and therapy in the context of obesity and eating disorders. First, we will discuss the possibility to identify new biological markers of brain functions. Second, we will highlight the potential of neuroimaging and neuromodulation in individualized medicine. Third, we will introduce the ethical questions that are concomitant to the emergence of new neuromodulation therapies. \u2022 We review the neural vulnerability factors related to obesity and eating disorders. \u2022 We compare the pros and cons of neuroimaging techniques to study eating behavior. \u2022 We present non-invasive strategies to modulate food-related brain processes. \u2022 We also present invasive neuromodulation methods such as VNS and DBS. \u2022 We discuss about neuroimaging and neuromodulation for prevention and therapy.

    "abstract": "An evaluation of a variety of efficient water heating strategies for an all-electric single family home located in a mixed-humid climate is conducted using numerical modeling. The strategies considered include various combinations of solar thermal, heat pump, and electric resistance water heaters. The numerical model used in the study is first validated against a year of field data obtained on a dual-tank system with a solar thermal preheat tank feeding a heat pump water heater that serves as a backup. Modeling results show that this configuration is the most efficient of the systems studied over the course of a year, with a system coefficient of performance (COP sys ) of 2.87. The heat pump water heater alone results in a COP sys of 1.9, while the baseline resistance water heater has a COP sys of 0.95. Impacts on space conditioning are also investigated by considering the extra energy consumption required of the air source heat pump to remove or add heat from the conditioned space by the water heating system. A modified COP sys that incorporates the heat pump energy consumption shows a significant drop in efficiency for the dual tank configuration since the heat pump water heater draws the most heat from the space in the heating season while the high temperatures in the solar storage tank during the cooling season result in an added heat load to the space. Despite this degradation in the COP sys , the combination of the solar thermal preheat tank and the heat pump water heater is the most efficient option even when considering the impacts on space conditioning.",

The current study was undertaken to assess the impact of COVID-19 on lifestyle-related behaviours: eating, physical activity and sleep behaviour. The study is a cross-sectional web-based survey. A validated questionnaire to assess the changes in lifestyle-related behaviour was administered on adults across India using a Google online survey platform. A total of 995 responses (58.5% male, mean age 33.3 years) were collected. An improvement in healthy meal consumption pattern and a restriction of unhealthy food items was observed, especially in the younger population (age <30 years). A reduction in physical activity coupled with an increase in daily screen time was found especially among men and in upper-socio-economic strata. Quarantine induced stress and anxiety showed an increase by a unit in nearly one-fourth of the participants. COVID-19 marginally improved the eating behaviour, yet one-third of participants gained weight as physical activity declined significantly coupled with an increase in screen and sitting time. Mental health was also adversely affected. A detailed understanding of these factors can help to develop interventions to mitigate the negative lifestyle behaviours that have manifested during COVID-19. \u2022 COVID-19 has affected every aspect of the lifestyle of citizens. \u2022 Slight improvement was seen in eating behavior, majorly by reduction in intake of high fat, sugar, salt and sugar foods. \u2022 A significant decline was seen in overall physical activity coupled with increase in sitting and screen time. \u2022 One third of the sample gained weight during COVID-19.

    "abstract": "We investigated the constraints on sulfide uptake by bacterial ectosymbionts on the marine peritrich ciliate Zoothamnium niveum by a combination of experimental and numerical methods. Protists with symbionts were collected on large blocks of mangrove-peat. The blocks were placed in a flow cell with flow adjusted to in situ velocity. The water motion around the colonies was then characterized by particle tracking velocimetry. This shows that the feather-shaped colony of Z. niveum generates a unidirectional flow of seawater through the colony with no recirculation. The source of the feeding current was the free-flowing water although the size of the colonies suggests that they live partly submerged in the diffusive boundary layer. We showed that the filtered volume allows Z. niveum to assimilate sufficient sulfide to sustain the symbiosis at a few micromoles per liter in ambient concentration. Numerical modeling shows that sulfide oxidizing bacteria on the surfaces of Z. niveum can sustain 100-times higher sulfide uptake than bacteria on flat surfaces, such as microbial mats. The study demonstrates that the filter feeding zooids of Z. niveum are preadapted to be prime habitats for sulfide oxidizing bacteria due to Z. niveum \u2019s habitat preference and due to the feeding current. Z. niveum is capable of exploiting low concentrations of sulfide in near norm-oxic seawater. This links its otherwise dissimilar habitats and makes it functionally similar to invertebrates with thiotrophic symbionts in filtering organs.

Therefore, this study aimed to assess and compare the risk of eating disorders and body shape perception. Data was collected from 773 undergraduate students at the Departments of Nutrition and Dietetics (NDD) (n = 254), Physical Education and Sports (PESD) (n = 263), and Social Sciences (SOC) (n = 256).A socio-demographic and personal information questionnaire, Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-40), Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ-34), Perceived Figure Rating Scale (FRS) were applied; and body weights and heights were measured. Mean EAT-40 scores showed that, both male and female students of PESD had the highest scores (17.4 \u00b1 11.6) compared with NDD (14.3 \u00b1 8.3) and SOC (13.0 \u00b1 6.2) ( P < 0.05). According to EAT-40 classification, high risk in abnormal eating behavior was more in PESD (10.7%) compared to NDD (2.9%) and SOC (0.4%) students ( P < 0.05). Students of PESD, who skipped meal, had higher tendency to the risk of eating disorders ( P < 0.05). In parallel, body shape perception was found to be marked with higher scores in NDD (72.0 \u00b1 28.7) and PESD (71.5 \u00b1 32.8) compared with SOC (64.2 \u00b1 27.5) students ( P < 0.05). Considering BSQ-34 classification, high concern (moderate and marked) for body shape were more in PESD (7.4 %) compared to NDD (5.2%) and SOC (1.9%) students ( P < 0.05). The body size judgement via obtained by the FRS scale were generally correlated with BMI. The Body Mass Index levels were in normal range (Mean BMI: 21.9 \u00b1 2.8 kg/m 2 ) and generally consistent with FRS data. Tendency to the abnormal eating behavior and substantial body shape perception were higher in PESD students who have more concern on body shape and were not well-educated about nutrition.

This study examines the morphology of the feeding apparatus of two species of long-proboscid Tabanidae: Philoliche rostrata and Philoliche gulosa \u2013 both species display adaptations for feeding from a diverse guild of long-tubed flowers, and on vertebrate blood. The heavily sclerotised proboscis can be divided into two functional units.

    "abstract": "Peritraumatic response, as currently assessed by Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) diagnostic criterion A2, has weak positive predictive value (PPV) with respect to PTSD diagnosis. Research suggests that indicators of peritraumatic autonomic activation may supplement the PPV of PTSD criterion A2. We describe the development and factor structure of the STRS (Shortness of Breath, Tremulousness, Racing Heart, and Sweating), a one page, two-minute checklist with a five-point Likert-type response format based on a previously unpublished scale. It is the first validated self-report measure of peritraumatic activation of the autonomic nervous system. We selected items from the Potential Stressful Events Interview (PSEI) to represent two latent variables: 1) PTSD diagnostic criterion A, and 2) acute autonomic activation. Participants (a convenience sample of 162 non-treatment seeking young adults) rated the most distressing incident of their lives on these items. We examined the factor structure of the STRS in this sample using factor and cluster analysis. Results confirmed a two-factor model. The factors together accounted for 68% of the variance. The variance in each item accounted for by the two factors together ranged from 41% to 74%. The item loadings on the two factors mapped precisely onto the two proposed latent variables. The factor structure of the STRS is robust and interpretable. Autonomic activation signs tapped by the STRS constitute a dimension of the acute autonomic activation in response to stress that is distinct from the current PTSD criterion A2. Since the PTSD diagnostic criteria are likely to change in the DSM-V, further research is warranted to determine whether signs of peritraumatic autonomic activation such as those measured by this two-minute scale add to the positive predictive power of the current PTSD criterion A2. Additionally, future research is warranted to explore whether the four automatic activation items of the STRS can be useful as the basis for a possible PTSD criterion A3 in the DSM-V.",

    "abstract": "The aim was to evaluate the potential of mucus-permeating nanoparticles for the oral administration of insulin. These nanocarriers, based on the coating of zein nanoparticles with a polymer conjugate containing PEG, displayed a size of 260\u00a0nm with a negative surface charge and an insulin payload of 77\u00a0\u03bcg/mg. In intestinal pig mucus, the diffusivity of these nanoparticles (PPA-NPs) was found to be 20-fold higher than bare nanoparticles (NPs). These results were in line with the biodistribution study in rats, in which NPs remained trapped in the mucus, whereas PPA-NPs were able to cross this layer and reach the epithelium surface. The therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in Caenorhabditis elegans grown under high glucose conditions. In this model, worms treated with insulin-loaded in PPA-NPs displayed a longer lifespan than those treated with insulin free or nanoencapsulated in NPs. This finding was associated with a significant reduction in the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as well as an important decrease in the glucose and fat content in worms. These effects would be related with the mucus-permeating ability of PPA-NPs that would facilitate the passage through the intestinal peritrophic-like dense layer of worms (similar to mucus) and, thus, the absorption of insulin. The surface modification of nanoparticles with a PEG-Gantrez\u00aeAN conjugate resulted in mucus-permeating nanocarriers. In the Caenorhabditis elegans model, these nanoparticles promoted the absorption, and thus the interaction of the insulin with its specific receptor (DAF-2/insulin). Image 1",

    "abstract": "Dietary guidelines can be considered a pedagogical tool, designed to promote healthy eating at the population level. In this study, we critically examine the biopedagogies implicated in Sweden\u2019s official dietary guidelines. Published in 2015, these guidelines take a potentially innovative \u2018holistic approach\u2019 to food and eating, addressing the challenge of formulating dietary advice that considers both human health and environmental concerns. Applying Bacchi\u00b4s \u2018What\u2019s the problem represented to be?\u2019 approach, we interrogate how the guidelines frame the interplay of public health concerns and environmental concerns in making food choices. We find that the biopedagogies of sustainable eating, as presented in these guidelines, implicate the subject position of the ideal eater . The ideal eater values sustainability, has high cultural capital, and draws on both taste and nutritional knowledge to make good food choices. However, while the ideal eater is expected to be aware of environmental issues, these are incorporated into the ideal eater\u2019s choices only in addition to the primary concern of health. Thus, although the guidelines frame a \u2018holistic approach\u2019 as the solution to both health and environmental concerns, in cases where health and environmental priorities conflict, the guidelines\u2019 biopedagogies of sustainable eating align with earlier biopedagogies of healthy eating.",

    "abstract": "Introduction: Several studies have noted the potentially negative effect of eating disorders (ED) on cognitive performance. Objective: To compare the impact of the duration of abnormal eating behaviors on cognitive performance in a sample of people with short- and long-term eating disorders and in two control groups matched for age. Method: The neuropsychological performance of 82 women diagnosed with an eating disorder were compared with two control groups from the community of 66 healthy women. Time of duration of the disorder was less than two years in half of the clinical sample, and more than 10 years in the other half. The following instruments were used to measure neuropsychological performance: the Matrix Test, the Stroop task, the Trail-Making Test, the Tower of London Test, the Posner Spatial Task, the Rey\u2019s Complex Figure, the Wechsler Vocabulary Test, and the Hayling Completion Test. Results: It showed that persons with long-term ED presented more impaired neuropsychological profiles, but not in all areas. In contrast, the short-term ED group presented similar profiles to the control groups. Discussion: This study highlights the positive association between cognitive impairment and time of evolution of ED, above all in perceptual measures and non-verbal memory. Considering the effect of the evolution of ED cognitive performance (especially in long-term patients) may further our understanding of the development of the disorder and the factors that may favor its persistence.",

There are case reports of oesophageal cancer in patients with eating disorders. We followed up a cohort of patients hospitalised previously with eating disorders. These patients were at significantly increased risk of oesophageal cancer. All cancers were squamous cell carcinomas in females with prior anorexia nervosa. Indirect evidence suggests confounding by established risk factors. It has been suggested that the risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma might be increased in patients with a history of eating disorders due to acidic damage to oesophageal mucosa caused by self-induced vomiting practiced as a method of weight control. Eating disorders have also been associated with risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus, including alcohol use disorders, as well as smoking and nutritional deficiencies, which have been associated with both main sub-types of oesophageal cancer. There have been several case reports of oesophageal cancer (both main sub-types) arising in patients with a history of eating disorders. We used linked records of hospitalisation, cancer registration and mortality in Scotland spanning 1981\u20132012 to investigate the risk of oesophageal cancer among patients with a prior history of hospitalisation with eating disorder. The cohort was restricted to patients aged \u226510 years and <60 years at the date of first admission with eating disorder. Disregarding the first year of follow-up, we calculated indirectly standardised incidence ratios using the general population as the reference group to generate expected numbers of cases (based on age-, sex-, socio-economic deprivation category-, and calendar period-specific rates of disease). After exclusions, the cohort consisted of 3617 individuals contributing 52,455 person-years at risk. The median duration of follow-up was 13.9 years. Seven oesophageal cancers were identified, as compared with 1.14 expected, yielding a standardised incidence ratio of 6.1 (95% confidence interval: 2.5\u201312.6). All were squamous cell carcinomas arising in females with a prior history of anorexia nervosa. Patients hospitalised previously with eating disorders are at increased risk of developing oesophageal cancer. Confounding by established risk factors (alcohol, smoking, and nutritional deficiency) seems a more likely explanation than acidic damage through self-induced vomiting because none of the incident cases of oesophageal cancer were adenocarcinomas, and because the study cohort had higher than background rates of hospitalisation with alcohol-related conditions and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.",

To investigate the inter-pair differences in caries prevalence among South Indian monozygotic twins in relation to birth weight, birth order, and gender. Possible correlation among other attributes such as breastfeeding, socioeconomic status, oral habits, frequency of brushing, and sweet intake were also assessed. A sample of 40 monozygotic children between the age group of 6 and 12 was selected. The parents were asked to complete the questionnaire and report with their children. Then dental examinations were carried out and the prevalence of dental caries among the twins were assessed. Among the total samples, 61.5% exhibited caries. Lower birth weight twins showed an increased chance of caries (72.22%), compared to higher birth weight twins (68.18%). Second of the twins had an increased risk of dental caries (70%) compared to the first (60%). 90% of the male twins and 45% of the female twins had caries. The association between dental caries and other variables were also assessed; those who were exclusively breastfed had an increased risk (70%) of caries. Evaluation of socioeconomic status and caries revealed a risk of for the high (65%), middle (62.5%), and lower groups (58.33%). Children without oral habits showed a higher prevalence (73.3%) of caries when compared to those without any habits (50%). It was noticed that the brushing frequency is not related to the severity of caries. The strongest association was noticed between excessive sweet liking and prevalence of dental caries. The study revealed difference in caries prevalence among monozygotic twins in relation to birth weight, birth order, and gender. It was found that variations in caries prevalence existed with other attributes also. Zarina R, Kuriakose S, et al.

    "abstract": "It is not always possible to administer antituberculosis pharmacotherapy orally for reasons that may be a direct consequence of tuberculosis itself. To our knowledge, no published literature is available regarding antituberculosis drug absorption via feeding tube. We present the case of a patient with tuberculosis meningitis who required medication administration via percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy ( PEJ ) tube. Blood samples were collected during the continuation phase of antituberculosis therapy, immediately before dose administration, and then at 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours after dose administration for quantification of serum rifampin concentrations. Assaying these concentrations by high\u2010pressure liquid chromatography demonstrated a peak serum rifampin level (C max ) of 18 \u03bcg/ml and total rifampin exposure (area under the curve from 0\u20136 hours [ AUC  0\u20136 ]) of 50.1 \u03bcg/ml. These are high compared with rifampin C max and AUC  0\u20136 values reported in patients after oral rifampin administration; C max tends to range between 4.0\u201310.5 \u03bcg/ml and AUC  0\u20136 7.0\u201352.9 \u03bcg/ml after oral administration of 600 mg at steady state. Based on our patient's results, therefore, rifampin administered by PEJ tube appears to be well absorbed, with preservation of adequate C max and AUC values. It is worth noting that this was in the context of drug administration in the fasted state. In the absence of any published evidence of adequate absorption via jejunal feeding tube in the nonfasted state, it would seem prudent to ensure that patients are fasted when rifampin is administered via PEJ tube, just as patients are when oral rifampin is administered. This report represents the first documented evidence, to our knowledge, of adequate rifampin absorption when administered via PEJ tube and provides important reassurance for health care providers, patients, and families facing similar clinical scenarios.",

This study investigated key beliefs that guide mothers\u2019 intention to adherence to dietary diversity in their 1\u20132-year-old children's complementary feeding. This was a cross-sectional study involving 290 mothers (mean age = 27, standard deviation = 5.32) with child 1\u20132-year-old attending maternal and child health section of health centers in Rasht, Iran. To represent the socioeconomic status of the participants, 6 centers out of 15 were selected from three different socioeconomic areas (low-, middle-, and high-income areas). Mothers completed a questionnaire assessing intention and belief-based items of theory of planned behavior. Correlations and multiple regression analyses were performed. The mean age of mothers was 27 \u00b1 5.33 (27\u201343 years). Regression analyses revealed that among behavioral beliefs, the perception that adherence to dietary diversity would lead to improve children's growth was the significant predictor of intention (\u03b2 = 0.13, P = 0.04). Regarding normative beliefs, perceived social pressure from health-care professionals to adherence to dietary diversity significantly predicted intention (\u03b2 = 0.15, P = 0.01). Among control beliefs, the perception that daily pressures made difficult adherence to dietary diversity was the key determinant (\u03b2 = 0.19, P = 0.01). Findings of this study represent the important beliefs that can be addressed in development planning aimed at modifying mothers\u2019 child complementary feeding practices.",

These constructs have typically been studied in isolation in children and little is known about how they interrelate and whether these associations differ by sex. In a low-income sample of 230 seven- to ten-year-old children, we assessed RRV, ATDG, and EAH. We separately tested by sex the model that elevated RRV, lower ATDG and greater EAH are each independent direct predictors of overweight in middle childhood. We predicted that greater RRV and less ATDG would also have indirect effects on overweight through EAH. We investigated the association between RRV and ATDG. For girls, higher RRV was indirectly associated with overweight through EAH. For boys, no associations of RRV, ATDG, or EAH with overweight were significant. Finally, for girls RRV and ATDG were significantly positively associated. In girls, higher food reinforcement appears to be an important contributor to overweight. During middle childhood, ATDG may be assessing food reinforcement rather than self-control. Future studies are needed to identify the mechanisms underlying childhood overweight in boys.",

Antipsychotic drugs seem to interfere with feeding behaviors and energy balance, processes that control metabolic regulation. Reward and energy balance centers in central nervous system constitute the cen-tral level of metabolic regulation. The peripheral level consists of skeletal muscles, the liver, the pancreas, the adipose tissue and neuroendocrine connections. Neurotransmitter receptors have crucial roles in metabolic regulation and they are also tar-gets of antipsychotic drugs.

Caregivers of patients with ED ( n = 254) and a comparison group of non\u2010ED caregivers ( N = 254) were recruited at baseline. Additionally, caregivers of patients with ED were invited into a free 4\u2010week online education program, with an additional online group as support. Depression and anxiety levels were assessed at baseline and after the intervention. Caregivers of patients with ED showed significantly higher levels of depression and anxiety than the comparison group of non\u2010ED caregivers. The online education program showed no significant effect on decreasing depression and anxiety levels of caregivers of patients with ED overall. Caregivers who had older loved ones and not living with them were more likely to decrease their depression levels. Caregivers of patients with longer illness duration were less likely to decrease their anxiety levels. These results showed that caregivers of ED patients suffered more serious psychological distress during the pandemic.

    "abstract": "Few studies have investigated the effects of dexmedetomidine (DEX) on breastfeeding after cesarean delivery. A randomized double-blind controlled trial was conducted to investigate whether the administration of DEX, immediately after delivery and for patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA), can be beneficial for breastfeeding. One hundred sixty parturients scheduled for elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia were randomly allocated to the DEX group (a loading dose of DEX was pumped at 0.5 \u03bcg/kg within 10 min, followed by a further infusion of DEX at 0.5 \u03bcg/kg/h until the end of the surgery and PCIA for 2 days with DEX plus sufentanil) or the standard care group (infusion saline intraoperatively, and PCIA for 2 days with sufentanil). The number of days required to switch to exclusive breastfeeding within six weeks of delivery, the time to first lactation and breast milk volume on day 1 and day 2 after delivery were recorded. Recovery quality, comfort, anxiety, depression, postoperative analgesia, and adverse reactions of parturients were also assessed. Compared with the standard care group, parturients in the DEX group could be converted to exclusive breastfeeding earlier (11 [14] vs 8 [10] days, log-rank P=0.025), the first lactation time was sooner (28.38 [13.82] vs 33.79 [14.85] hrs, P=0.024), and the amount of breast milk on the second day after delivery increased (P=0.012). There was no difference between the two groups in postpartum uterine contraction pain, but postpartum rest and movement VAS scores and recovery quality score in the DEX group were better than those in the standard care group (all P<0.05). Moreover, the hospital anxiety and depression scale and anxiety subscale score on the second day after delivery and the comfort score on the third day after delivery in the DEX group were significantly better than those in the standard care group (5 [5] vs 6 [8], 2 [2] vs 3 [3], 83.58 [6.75] vs 80.48 [6.58]; P=0.013, P=0.005, P=0.006, respectively). The incidence of adverse events, such as bradycardia, vomiting, hypersomnia, hypertension and hypotension, was not significantly different between the DEX and standard care groups (6.9% vs 2.7%, 5.6% vs 13.7%, 4.2% vs 0%, 5.6% vs 2.7%, 11.1% vs 8.2%; P=0.275, P=0.158, P=0.366, P=0.681, P=0.556, respectively), except more parturients experienced nausea in the standard care group than in the DEX group (28.8% vs 11.1%, P=0.012). Furthermore, there was no difference in Neonatal Behavioral Neurological Assessment scores on the first and second days after delivery between the DEX and standard care groups (38 [3] vs 37 [2], 38.5 [2] vs 38 [2]; P=0.173, P=0.312, respectively). The application of DEX in the perioperative period of cesarean section was not only conducive to the early conversion of infant feeding to exclusive breastfeeding but could also improve the recovery quality and comfort of the parturient, optimize analgesia, shorten the time to first lactation, and increase lactation.

Both the COVID-19 confirmed (58\u20223%) and suspected (52\u20226%) groups presented significantly lower rates of breastfeeding as compared with the control group (95\u20222%). All 44 breast milk samples tested negative for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. Thirty-eight breast milk samples underwent antibody testing and all tested negative for IgG. Twenty-one breast milk samples from 8 women tested positive for IgM, while the remaining samples from 11 women tested negative. Considering the lack of evidence for SARS-CoV-2 transmission through breast milk, breastfeeding counselling along with appropriate hand hygiene precautions and facemasks should be provided to all pregnant women. The study was funded by the Hong Kong Committee for UNICEF.",

    "abstract": "The breast milk of HIV infected women contains HIV virus particles, therefore children can become infected through breastfeeding. We develop a mathematical epidemiological model of HIV infection in infants, infected children and infected women that represents infection of an infant/child as a series of exposures, by incorporating within-host virus dynamics in the individuals exposed to the virus through breastfeeding. We show that repeated exposures of the infant/child via breastfeeding can cause bi-stability dynamics and, subsequently, infection persistence even when the epidemiological basic reproduction number R 0 is less than unity. This feature of the model, due to a backward\u00a0bifurcation, gives new insight into the control mechanisms of HIV disease through breastfeeding.",

    "abstract": "Optimal breastfeeding is recommended up to two years, i.e, it prevents 1.4 million child deaths per year. Despite this prelacteal feeding is commonly practiced in Ethiopia due to different reasons. The objective of this study was to assess prelacteal feeding and associated factors among mothers who have infants less than six months of age. A community based quantitative cross sectional study was conducted from April 7, 2015 to May 7, 2015. Using simple random sampling method total of 423 mothers with infant less than six months old were included in this study. The data were collected by using an interviewer admini stered questionnaire. Both simple and multiple logistic regression analyses were computed to identify factors associated with prelacteal feeding. Prevalence of prelacteal feeding was 20.3% [95% CL: 16.38% \u2013 24.02%]. The most common prelacteal feeding in the study area was butter (62.2%). Mothers with young infant who fed colostrum [AOR=3.540 (1.534, 8.173), initiated breastfeeding on time [AOR=4.4832 (1.823, 11.028)] and supported by husband's [AOR=2.686 (1.037, 6.953)] were less likely to practice prelacteal feeding to their infant than their counterparts. Prelacteal feeding was common in the study area. Colostrum feeding, timely initiations of breastfeeding and husband support were the independent predictors of prelacteal feeding practices. Recommendation to avoid prelacteal feeding practices were: increasing the habit of mothers to initiate breastfeeding timely and to feed colostrum through education, empowering husbands regarding to breastfeeding and avoiding traditional practices that hinder optimal breastfeeding like colostrum avoidance.",

This was an open label, non-comparative single-center study. Drospirenone 4\u2009mg per day was the first postpartum contraceptive for the study participants who were no longer breastfeeding yet were still lactating. It was administered for 7\u2009days to achieve steady-state concentration. All participants were volunteers who planned to use oral contraceptives as their family planning method in the future. Twelve volunteers completed the trial according to the protocol, and the samples of all 12 study completers were analyzed. The average concentration\u2013time curve of drospirenone in plasma 24\u2009h after the administration of the last dose (area under the curve (0\u201324\u2009h)) was 635.33\u2009ng\u2009h/mL and 120\u2009h after the single repeated dose administration (area under the curve (0\u2013120\u2009h)) was 1180.57\u2009ng\u2009h/mL, respectively.

    "abstract": "Gluconeogenesis responses was assessed during a short starvation period and subsequent refeeding in Siberian sturgeon ( Acipenser baerii ) previously fed different dietary carbohydrates levels and experienced to a glucose stimuli during early life. The sturgeon larvae were previously fed either a high glucose diet (G) or a low glucose diet (F) from the first feeding to yolk absorption (8 to 12\u00a0d post-hatching [dph]). Each group of fish was sub-divided into 2 treatments at 13\u00a0dph and was fed either a high-carbohydrate diet (H) or a low carbohydrate diet (L) until 20\u00a0wk. In the current study, the fish in 4 groups (GL, FL, GH and FH) were experienced to starvation for 21\u00a0d following by re-feeding of their corresponding diets for 21\u00a0d. Fish were sampled at postprandial 6 and 24\u00a0h before starvation (P6h and P24h), starvation 7, 14 and 21\u00a0d (S7, S14 and S21) and 1, 7, 14 and 21\u00a0d during refeeding (R1, R7, R14 and R21). Plasma samples during refeeding were taken at P6h at each time point. Glycaemia levels, liver and muscle glycogen contents, activities and mRNA levels of hepatic gluconeogenic enzymes were examined. We found that both dietary carbohydrate levels and early glucose stimuli significantly affected the metabolic responses to starvation and refeeding in Siberian sturgeon ( P <\u00a00.05). During prolonged starvation, Siberian sturgeon firstly mobilized the liver glycogen and then improved gluconeogenesis when the dietary carbohydrates were abundant, whereas preserved the liver glycogen stores at a stable level and more effectively promoted gluconeogenesis when the dietary carbohydrates are absent to maintain glucose homoeostasis. During refeeding, as most teleostean, Siberian sturgeon failed controlling the activities and mRNA levels of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase cytosolic forms ( PEPCK-C ), fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase ( FBPase ), but particularly controlled phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mitochondrial forms ( PEPCK-M ) activities and mRNA expression of glucose-6-phosphatase ( G6Pase , except in GL group). Siberian sturgeon has a full compensatory ability on growth, but this ability would be obstructed by early glucose stimuli when refeeding the low carbohydrate diet after S21.",

    "abstract": "To study neuronal networks in terms of their function in behavior, we must analyze how neurons operate when each behavioral pattern is generated. Thus, simultaneous recordings of neuronal activity and behavior are essential to correlate brain activity to behavior. For such behavioral analyses, the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster , allows us to incorporate genetically encoded calcium indicators such as GCaMP 1 , to monitor neuronal activity, and to use sophisticated genetic manipulations for optogenetic or thermogenetic techniques to specifically activate identified neurons 2-5 . Use of a thermogenetic technique has led us to find critical neurons for feeding behavior (Flood et al. , under revision). As a main part of feeding behavior, a Drosophila adult extends its proboscis for feeding 6 (proboscis extension response; PER), responding to a sweet stimulus from sensory cells on its proboscis or tarsi. Combining the protocol for PER 7 with a calcium imaging technique 8 using GCaMP3.0 1, 9 , I have established an experimental system, where we can monitor activity of neurons in the feeding center \u2013 the suboesophageal ganglion (SOG), simultaneously with behavioral observation of the proboscis. I have designed an apparatus (\"Fly brain Live Imaging and Electrophysiology Stage\": \"FLIES\") to accommodate a Drosophila adult, allowing its proboscis to freely move while its brain is exposed to the bath for Ca 2+ imaging through a water immersion lens. The FLIES is also appropriate for many types of live experiments on fly brains such as electrophysiological recording or time lapse imaging of synaptic morphology. Because the results from live imaging can be directly correlated with the simultaneous PER behavior, this methodology can provide an excellent experimental system to study information processing of neuronal networks, and how this cellular activity is coupled to plastic processes and memory.",

Anorexia nervosa is common, it has two subtypes; restrictive and binge/purge. Ischaemic bowel associated with anorexia nervosa is rare but potentially life-threatening. The mechanism of ischaemic bowel in anorexia nervosa has not been fully elucidated. This condition should be highlighted as it has a high associated mortality. Prompt involvement of radiology and surgery appears pivotal to outcome. Anorexia Nervosa affects up to 1% of the population and can present with binge/purge episodes. A paucity of literature exists regarding small bowel and colonic ischaemia relating to this common condition. We report our own experience and management of a patient with anorexia nervosa binge/purge subtype with small bowel and colon ischaemia and review existing cases in the literature. A 32\u00a0year old female self-presented to the emergency department complaining of abdominal pain, abdominal distension and vomiting on a background history of binge/purge subtype eating disorder, following consumption of a large amount of carbohydrates. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen was performed urgently which revealed extensive pneumatosis involving the stomach and its draining veins with evidence of extensive portal venous gas. A right hemicolectomy followed by re-look laparotomy in 48\u00a0h with resection of jejunum, jejunojejunal anastomosis and end-ileostomy was performed with a successful outcome. Anorexia nervosa can be a potentially life-threatening disease, with rates of death 10\u201312 times that of the normal population. Ischaemic bowel is a rare potential complication, with mortality rates of up to 80% having been reported prior to this case. Although the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated, gastric dilation, abnormal digestive motility, and faecal impaction appear to contribute, on a background of impaired blood supply. Clinicians need to exhibit a high index of suspicion for patients with abdominal pain on the background of an eating disorder, particularly in the context of suspected recent refeeding/binge eating. Prompt involvement of appropriate radiology and surgery input are pivotal to outcome.",

The study was performed as a crossover design, and ten unresectable or relapsed gastric cancer patients were randomly divided into two groups. Group A (n = 5) was started on Rikkunshito (2.5 g three times daily, orally) from the first course of chemotherapy and followed by a second course without Rikkunshito. A treatment with reversed order was performed for Group B (n = 5). All patients received combined chemotherapy with S-1 plus cisplatin. The primary endpoint was the amount of oral intake, and the categories of scales of anorexia, nausea, and vomiting; secondary endpoints included the plasma concentration of acylated ghrelin. In the Rikkunshito-on period, no decrease of the plasma concentration of acylated ghrelin induced by cisplatin was observed. The average oral intake in the Rikkunshito-on period was significantly larger than that in the Rikkunshito-off period, and the grade of anorexia was significantly lower in the Rikkunshito-on period than in the Rikkunshito-off period. Rikkunshito appeared to prevent anorexia induced by cisplatin, resulting in effective prophylactic administration of chemotherapy with cisplatin, and patients could continue their treatments on schedule.",

Gentrification, the influx of capital and residents of higher socioeconomic status into historically-disinvested neighborhoods, is a growing trend with the potential to place urban communities under social and financial pressure. Hypothesizing that these pressures and other community changes resulting from gentrification could be tied to excessive alcohol consumption, we examined the relationship between gentrification and binge drinking in California neighborhoods. California census tracts were categorized as non-gentrifiable, stable (gentrifiable), or gentrifying from 2006\u20132015. Outcomes and covariates were obtained from the California Health Interview Survey using combined 2013\u20132015 data (n = 60,196). Survey-weighted logistic regression tested for associations between gentrification and any binge drinking in the prior 12 months. Additional models tested interactions between gentrification and other variables of interest, including housing tenure, federal poverty level, race/ethnicity, sex, and duration of neighborhood residence. A third of respondents reported past-year binge drinking. Controlling for demographic covariates, gentrification was not associated with binge drinking in the population overall (AOR = 1.13, 95% CI = 0.95\u20131.34), but was associated with binge drinking among those living in the neighborhood <5 years (AOR = 1.49, 95% CI 1.15\u20131.93). No association was seen among those living in their neighborhood \u22655 years. For those newer to their neighborhood, gentrification is associated with binge drinking. Further understanding the relationship between gentrification and high-risk alcohol use is important for policy and public health interventions mitigating the impact of this process.",

Eleven surgically reconstructed maxillectomy patients have been included at University of Alberta and nine implant\u2010supported obturator patients at MUMC+. The mixing ability test (MAT) was used to measure masticatory performance. In addition, the oral health related quality of life (OHRQoL) was measured with shortened versions of the oral health impact profile (OHIP) questionnaire. Values of the implant\u2010supported obturator group versus the surgical reconstruction group were compared with independent t\u2010tests in case of normal distribution, otherwise the Mann\u2010Whitney U test was applied. Patients with reconstructed maxillae and patients with implant\u2010supported obturator prostheses had similar mean mixing ability indices (18.20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.38 resp. 18.66\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.37; P =\u00a0.614).

Given that EBF is a physiological process which transpires in a specific socio-economic milieu, this study investigates the socio-economic factors militating against its uptake. The study used a mixed research methodology. The concurrent nested model of mixed methods was utilized using one data collection phase, during which both quantitative and qualitative data were collected simultaneously. The research noted that factors such as low education, low income, gender inequalities, social influence, and traditional practices were hindering the uptake of exclusive breast feeding. The study envisages that it is pertinent for infant feeding programs to address socio-economic barriers to EBF in order to influence a positive uptake. The potential interventions include increasing men\u2019s involvement, raising awareness on EBF, and strengthening the Village Health Worker Program.",

    "abstract": "We summarized recent literature on the epidemiology and treatment of eating disorders in middle-aged and older women and men. The prevalence of eating disorders according to DSM-5 criteria is around 3.5% in older (>40 years) women and around 1\u20132% in older men. The majority of those eating disordered persons are not in treatment. There are new terms like \u2018perimenopausal eating disorders\u2019 and \u2018muscularity-oriented eating disorders\u2019 indicating the impact of the aging process and sex-specific differences. Disordered eating and eating disorders occur in both women and men of all ages. Medical complications because of age, the stigma of eating disorders in a still \u2018untypical\u2019 age, and the glorification of sports activity often hinder the recognition of eating disorders in midlife and older persons. Treatment approaches should consider treatment strategies tailored for older women and men, addressing the context of midlife and aging.",

    "abstract": "Night Eating Syndrome (NES) is characterized by a delay in the circadian rhythm of food intake and affects 1.5% of the general population, occurring more frequently in obese people. The Night Eating Questionnaire (NEQ) was originally developed for the American adult population. It is a self-administered instrument widely used in the identification and follow-up of individuals with NES. Although the NEQ has been translated and validated for Brazilian adults, there are no reports of its adaptation for use in Brazilian adolescents. The present study aimed to adapt and evaluate reliability and reproducibility of the NEQ for Brazilian adolescents. Initially, a semantic adaptation of the Portuguese version of the NEQ was performed by 3 professionals with experience with adolescents. The suggested text was analyzed and consolidated item by item by the researchers and then presented to 21 adolescents from an intermediate school in Fortaleza. The questions with low level of understanding (<90%) were modified and the questionnaire was re-applied to 23 adolescents, obtaining satisfactory understanding. The version of the NEQ for Brazilian adolescents, compared to the adult version, contains changes in items 3, 5, 6, 7 and 13. The questionnaire was administered to 463 students aged 11 to 17 years (mean \u00b1 SD = 13.7 \u00b1 1.2), from 3 schools. The internal consistency, measured by the Cronbach's alpha coefficient, was 0.73. The reproducibility that was measured after one week in 27 adolescents was 0.92 (95% CI 0.82-0.96). The new version of the NEQ for Brazilian adolescents presents excellent reproducibility and good internal consistency and is a simple and useful instrument to evaluate nocturnal eating symptoms in this age group.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this research is to determine retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) prevalence and possible risk factors associated with ROP development in newborns admitted to a neonatal unit of a Peruvian National Reference Hospital. This retrospective study included 216 preterm infants. The data were collected between January 2016 and December 2018. All infants were examined according to Peruvian guidelines for screening and treatment of ROP. The association of clinical risk factors and the development of ROP was analyzed and predictive factors were determined. The study subjects were 216 preterm infants of which 72 had some stage of ROP (32 stage 1; 23 stage 2 and 17 stage 3) and 144 preterm infants without ROP. The incidence of ROP in preterm infants less than 32 weeks was 60.9%, while for those weighing less than 1500 g it was 71.6%. The factors associated with ROP were gestational age below 32 weeks, birth weight below 1500 grams, neonatal sepsis, oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, hyaline membrane disease, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, persistence of ductus arteriosus and intraventricular hemorrhage. Exclusive breastfeeding was found to play a protective role against ROP. Binary logistic regression analysis found that only gestational age below 32 weeks (OR, 2.637; 95% CI, 1.04\u20136.69), weight below 1500 grams (OR, 4.377; 95% CI, 1.75\u201310.92), neonatal sepsis (OR, 6.517; 95% CI, 2.81\u201315.14), vaginal delivery (OR, 3.748; 95% CI: 1.54\u20139.14), and the presence of hyaline membrane disease (OR, 3.58; 95% CI, 1.47\u20138.74) are predictors of ROP. The incidence of ROP among very low birth weight infants was 71.6%. Infants with weight below 1500 grams, neonatal sepsis, presence of hyaline membrane disease whose mother had vaginal delivery are at risk for the development of ROP. Thus, preventing premature births and encouraging exclusive breastfeeding are two main ways to prevent ROP.",

    "abstract": "Glucose control is an important aspect in managing critically ill patients. The goal of this study was to compare the effects of sequential feeding (SF) and continuous feeding (CF) on the blood glucose of critically ill patients. A non-inferiority randomized controlled trial was adopted in this study. A total of 62 patients who were fed enteral nutritional suspension through gastric tubes were enrolled. After achieving 80% of the nutrition target calories (25\u200akcal\u00b7kg \u22121 \u00b7day \u22121 ) through CF, the patients were then randomly assigned into SF and CF groups. In the SF group, the feeding/fasting time was reasonably determined according to the circadian rhythm of the human body as laid out in traditional Chinese medicine theory. The total daily dosage of the enteral nutritional suspension was equally distributed among three time periods of 7 to 9 o\u2019clock, 11 to 13 o\u2019clock, and 17 to 19 o\u2019clock. The enteral nutritional suspension in each time period was pumped at a uniform rate within 2 h by an enteral feeding pump. In the CF group, patients received CF at a constant velocity by an enteral feeding pump throughout the study. Blood glucose values at five points (6:00/11:00/15:00/21:00/1:00) were monitored and recorded for seven consecutive days after randomization. Enteral feeding intolerance was also recorded. Non-inferiority testing was adopted in this study, the chi-square test or Fisher test was used for qualitative data, and the Mann-Whitney U test was used for quantitative data to determine differences between groups. In particular, a repeated measure one-way analysis of variance was used to identify whether changes in glucose value variables across the time points were different between the two groups. There were no significant demographic or physiological differences between the SF and CF groups ( P >\u200a0.050). The average glucose level in SF was not higher than that in CF (8.8 [7.3\u201310.3] vs. 10.7 [9.1\u201312.1] mmol/L, Z =\u200a\u22122.079, P for non-inferiority = 0.019). Hyperglycemia incidence of each patient was more common in the CF group than that in the SF group (38.4 [19.1\u201363.7]% vs. 11.8 [3.0\u201336.7]%, Z =\u200a\u22122.213, P =\u200a0.027). Hypoglycemia was not found in either group. Moreover, there was no significant difference during the 7 days in the incidence of feeding intolerance ( P >\u200a0.050). In this non-inferiority study, the average blood glucose in SF was not inferior to that in CF. The feeding intolerance in SF was similar to that in CF. SF may be as safe as CF for critically ill patients. ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03439618; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT03439618",

    "abstract": "Patients with atypical anorexia nervosa (AN) are often in the normal\u2010weight range at presentation; however, signs of starvation and medical instability are not rare. White matter (WM) microstructural correlates of atypical AN have not yet been investigated, leaving an important gap in our knowledge regarding the neural pathogenesis of this disorder. We investigated WM microstructural integrity in 25 drug\u2010na\u00efve adolescent patients with atypical AN and 25 healthy controls, using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with a tract\u2010based spatial statistics (TBSS) approach. Psychological variables related to the eating disorder and depressive symptoms were also evaluated by administering the eating disorder examination questionnaire (EDE\u2010Q) and the Montgomery\u2013\u00c5sberg depression rating scale (MADRS\u2010S) respectively, to all participants. Patients and controls were in the normal\u2010weight range and did not differ from the body mass index standard deviations for their age. No between groups difference in WM microstructure could be detected. Our findings support the hypothesis that brain structural alterations may not be associated to early\u2010stage atypical AN. These findings also suggest that previous observations of alterations in WM microstructure in full syndrome AN may constitute state\u2010related consequences of severe weight loss. Whether the preservation of WM structure is a pathogenetically discriminant feature of atypical AN or only an effect of a less severe nutritional disturbance, will have to be verified by future studies on larger samples, possibly directly comparing AN and atypical AN.",

Data were collected through participant observation and interviews. For this article, the analysis was narrowed down to the decision whether or not the patient should receive tube feeding. The data on tube feeding were assembled and coded according to different modes of dealing with this decision in clinical practice, which we refer to as \u201crepertoires.\u201d We discerned three different repertoires: choice, necessity, and comfort. Each repertoire structures clinical practice differently: It implies distinctive ethical imperatives, central concerns, sources of information, and temporalities.

    "abstract": "Transcranial magnetic resonance-guided focused ultrasound (FUS) therapy is a less invasive stereotactic treatment for tremor and other movement disorders. A sufficiently high temperature in the target brain tissue is crucial during ablation procedures for good outcomes. Therefore, maximizing the heating efficiency is critical in cases where high temperature cannot be achieved because of patient-related characteristics. However, a strategy to achieve the desired therapeutic temperature with FUS has not yet been established. This study aimed to investigate the procedural factors associated with heating efficiency in FUS. We retrospectively reviewed and analyzed data from patients who underwent FUS for ventralis intermedius (VIM) nucleus thalamotomy. In all, 30 consecutive patients were enrolled. 18 with essential tremor (ET), 11 with tremor-dominant Parkinson\u2019s disease (TDPD), and 1 with Holmes tremor. Multivariate regression analysis showed that decline in heating efficiency was associated with lower skull density ratio (SDR) and a greater subtotal rise in temperature until the previous sonication. To maximize heating efficiency, the temperature increase should be set to the least value in the target alignment and verification phases, and subsequently should be increased sufficiently in the treatment phase. This strategy may be particularly beneficial in cases where high ablation temperatures cannot be achieved because of patient-related characteristics. Importantly, a broad patient population would benefit from this strategy as it could reduce the need for high energy to achieve therapeutic temperatures, thereby decreasing the risks of adverse events.",

    "abstract": "Little is known on the early homing features of transplanted mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). We used the isolated rat heart model to study the homing of MSCs injected in the ventricular wall of a beating heart. In this model all types of cells and matrix elements with their interactions are represented, while external interferences by endothelial/neutrophil interaction and neurohormonal factors are excluded. We studied the morphology and marker expression of MSCs implanted in normal hearts and in the border-zone of infarcted myocardium. Early morphological adaptation of MSC homing differs between normal and infarcted hearts over the first 6 hrs after transplantation. In normal hearts, MSCs migrate very early through the interstitial milieu and begin to show morphological changes. Yet, in infarcted hearts MSCs remain in the site of injection forming clusters of round-shaped cells in the border-zone of the infarcted area. Both in normal and infarcted hearts, immuno-histochemistry and confocal imaging showed that, besides the proliferative marker proliferating cell nuclear agent (PCNA), some transplanted cells early express myoblastic maker GATA-4, and some of them show a VWF immunopositivity. Moreover, a few hours after injection connexin-43 is well evident between cardiomy-ocytes and injected cells. This study indicates for the first time that the isolated beating heart is a good model to study early features of MSC homing without external interferences. The results show ( i ) that MSCs start to change marker expression few hours after injection into a beating heart and ( ii ) that infarcted myocardium influences transplanted MSC morphology and mobility within the heart.",

In 1989\u201395, we evaluated the relation between childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and pre- and postnatal markers of exposure to infection, as well as breast-feeding. A population-based case-control study was carried out in certain regions of Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, in 1989\u201395 including 491 incident cases diagnosed between 1980 and 1993 and aged between 0 and 9 years. An identical number of healthy controls matched for age, sex and region of residence at the date of diagnosis was included. Having older siblings, mother's use of antibiotics during pregnancy, and being born second or later were all associated with increased risk of leukaemia while early day-care attendance (odds ratio (OR) = 0.49; 95% CI 0.31\u20130.77), and breast-feeding (OR = 0.68; 95% CI 0.49\u20130.95) were significantly protective.

    "abstract": "There is an urgent need to create effective interventions that help parents establish a healthy diet among their children early in life, especially among low-income and ethnically and racially diverse families. U.S. children eat too few fruits, vegetables and whole grains, and too many energy dense foods, dietary behaviors associated with increased morbidity from chronic diseases. Parents play a key role in shaping children's diets. Best practices suggest that parents should involve children in food preparation, and offer, encourage and model eating a variety of healthy foods. In addition, while parents help to shape food preferences, not all children respond in the same way. Certain child appetitive traits, such as satiety responsiveness (sensitivity to internal satiety signals), food responsiveness (sensitivity to external food cues), and food fussiness may help explain some of these differences. Prior interventions to improve the diet of preschool children have not used a holistic approach that targets the home food environment, by focusing on food quality, food preparation, and positive feeding practices while also acknowledging a child's appetitive traits. This manuscript describes the rationale and design for a 6-month pilot randomized controlled trial, Strong Families Start at Home, that randomizes parents and their 2-to 5-year old children to either a home-based environmental dietary intervention or an attention-control group. The primary aim of the study is to explore the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and evaluation and to determine the intervention's preliminary efficacy on child diet quality, feeding practices, and availability of healthy foods in the home.",

We investigated here a possible involvement of central NELL2 in regulating feeding behavior and metabolism. In situ hybridization and an im-munohistochemical approach were used to determine expression of NELL2 as well as its colocalization with proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the rat hypothalamus. To investigate the effect of NELL2 on feeding behavior, 2 nmole of antisense NELL2 oligodeoxynucleotide was administered into the lateral ventricle of adult male rat brains for 6 consecutive days, and changes in daily body weight, food, and water intake were monitored. Metabolic state-dependent NELL2 expression in the hypothalamus was tested in vivo using a fasting model. NELL2 was noticeably expressed in the hypothalamic nuclei controlling feeding behavior. Furthermore, all arcuatic POMC and NPY positive neurons produced NELL2. The NELL2 gene expression in the hypothalamus was up-regulated by fasting. However, NELL2 did not affect POMC and NPY gene expression in the hypothalamus. A blockade of NELL2 production in the hypothalamus led to a reduction in daily food intake, followed by a loss in body weight without a change in daily water intake in normal diet condition. NELL2 did not affect short-term hunger dependent appetite behavior. Our data suggests that hypothalamic NELL2 is associated with appetite behavior, and thus central NELL2 could be a new therapeutic target for obesity.",

The present study aims to conduct Polish adaptation and validation of the Authorized Bratman Orthorexia Self-Test (ABOST), through a comparison of dichotomous and continuous Likert response scales. This cross-sectional study involved 472 people with mean age of 27 years (ranging between 18 and 78 years, M = 26.88, SD = 10.40). The survey included demographic questions and measures of orthorexia (the ABOST and ORTO-15), eating disorders (EAT-26), body mass index (BMI), obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder (OCI-R), anxiety (GAD-7), and depression (PHQ-9). The following statistical tests were performed to explore the psychometric properties of the ABOST: descriptive statistics, Student\u2019s t -test, Pearson\u2019s correlation, Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 reliability, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The ABOST using a five-point Likert scale for responses demonstrated good psychometric properties. The CFA goodness-of-fit indices confirmed the one-factor solution. Positive correlations were found between the ABOST and the ORTO-15, EAT-26, OCI-R, GAD-7, and PHQ-9. Women scored higher in the ABOST than men, while BMI was unrelated to the ABOST. The ABOST using the Likert scale provides a reliable and valid instrument to assess ON risk, as indicated by the face, structural, and convergent validity results. However, more research in various countries is needed, in order to verify the results of this study.",

In a feeding experiment, 11 out of 69 reindeer were affected by wet belly. The problem was first observed in 7 animals during a period of restricted feed intake. When the animals were then fed standard rations, 3 additional animals fed only silage, and 1 fed pellets and silage, became wet. Four animals died and 1 had to be euthanised. To investigate why reindeer developed wet belly, we compared data from healthy reindeer and reindeer affected by wet belly. Urea, plasma protein, glucose, insulin and cortisol were affected by restricted feed intake or by diet but did not generally differ between healthy reindeer and those with wet belly. The wet animals had low body temperature and the deaths occurred during a period of especially cold weather. Animals that died were emaciated and showed different signs of infections and stress. In a second experiment, with 20 reindeer, the feeding procedure of the most affected group in the first experiment was repeated, but none of the reindeer showed any signs of wet belly. The study shows that wet belly is not induced by any specific diet and may affect also lichen-fed reindeer. The fluid making the fur wet was proven to be of internal origin. Mortality was caused by emaciation, probably secondary to reduced energy intake caused by diseases and/or unsuitable feed.",

Depression worsens the treatment outcomes of comorbid conditions and is a predictor of an increased mortality rate. Frequent comorbidities accompanying depressive syndrome are eating disorders (ED). The novel brain stimulation technique termed repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been developed as a clinical tool to treat depression. Simultaneously the effect of rTMS has been studied on ED. The aim of this study was to monitor the correlation between the improvement in depressive symptoms and changes in eating behavior after rTMS treatment, and potential possibility of the utilization of rTMS in the treatment of these frequent comorbid conditions. To map the change in eating behavior, this study follows the changes in answers 5 and 7 in the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale. The patients were treated with high-frequency rTMS focused on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. We observed a significant change in both questions. At the same time, the change in both questions correlates with a variance in the overall depressive symptoms. The rTMS treatment of depressive syndrome resulted in significant clinical improvements, including changes in eating behavior.",

We searched six databases for interventions: (a) delivered before age two, (b) specifically aimed at infants at high risk of childhood obesity and (c) that reported outcomes by weight status beyond 28\u2009days. The search identified over 27,000 titles, and 49 papers from 38 studies met inclusion criteria: 10 antenatal interventions, 16 postnatal and 12 conducted both before and after birth. Nearly all targeted infant and/or maternal nutrition. Studies varied widely in design, obesity risk factors, outcomes and quality. Overall, nine interventions of varying quality reported some evidence of significantly improved child weight trajectory, although effects tended to diminish over time. Interventions that improved weight outcomes tended to engage parents for a longer period, and most offered health professional input and support. Two studies of limited quality reported significantly worse weight outcomes in the intervention group.",

    "abstract": "There are many wrong practices and perceptions of Infant and Young Child Feeding (IYCF) prevalent among different socio-demographic groups. To observe IYCF perceptions and practices among mothers in a rural area of West Bengal. Clinic-based cross-sectional descriptive study by interviewing mothers of 0-23 month old children. Appropriate response to each selected key question was assigned a score of + 1 for objective assessment. Data analysis was done by standard statistical methods using the statistical software SPSS 13.0 (Kolkata, India) for windows version. Percentages were calculated for descriptive statistics. Chi-square test of significance was employed whenever required. 65.8% (225/342) mothers did not initiate breast feeding within 1 h of birth, 41.7% (90/216) mothers of children aged 6 months or more did not exclusively breastfeed their babies up to 6 months and 28.1% (96/342) used bottles for baby-feeding. Perception scores among younger than 20-year-old mothers were found to be highest; however, practice score increased significantly with age. Though perception and practice of mothers with some education were significantly better they wane with higher education. Lowest practice score was found in the richest per capita income group. Emphasis should be given to IYCF education sessions.",

    "abstract": " Background: Breastfeeding has been recognized to have a great deal of benefits for both the mothers and infants. Moreover, the importance of exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months of life has been greatly acknowledged. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the prevalence of starting breastfeeding in the first hour after delivery and the exclusive breast milk feeding as well as the age at which complimentary foods are provided to the child and duration of breastfeeding in Iran.  Methods: This nationwide cross-sectional study was conducted in the frame of a national survey, Iran Multiple Indicator Demographic and Health Survey (IrMIDHS), in 31 provinces of Iran. Participants were selected by multistage cluster sampling. The target sample was 3,096 clusters consisting of 2,187 urban and 909 rural families. Data were collected using a questionnaire through face-to-face interviews.  Results: The rate of exclusive breastfeeding was 53.13% with higher prevalence in rural (67.76%) than in urban areas (47.79%) (P = 0.04), and among girls (56.35%) compared to boys (50.60%). The prevalence of breastfeeding as the main diet of Iranian infants under six months old was 70.72% and the prevalence of initiation of breastfeeding (up to the first hour after delivery) was 68.70%. The probability of breastfeeding continuance among twelve to fifteen months children was 84.22%; the corresponding figure was 51% among twenty to twenty three months old babies (p=0.03).  Conclusion: Exclusive breastfeeding should be encouraged; and strategies that are more effective should be designed to protect, train and support young mothers to breastfeed their infants. The importance of early beginning of breastfeeding and its continuation should be underscored.",

    "abstract": "The brain occupies a special hierarchical position in human energy metabolism. If cerebral homeostasis is threatened, the brain behaves in a \u201cselfish\u201d manner by competing for energy resources with the body. Here we present a logistic approach, which is based on the principles of supply and demand known from economics. In this \u201ccerebral supply chain\u201d model, the brain constitutes the final consumer. In order to illustrate the operating mode of the cerebral supply chain, we take experimental data which allow assessing the supply, demand and need of the brain under conditions of psychosocial stress. The experimental results show that the brain under conditions of psychosocial stress actively demands energy from the body, in order to cover its increased energy needs. The data demonstrate that the stressed brain uses a mechanism referred to as \u201ccerebral insulin suppression\u201d to limit glucose fluxes into peripheral tissue (muscle, fat) and to enhance cerebral glucose supply. Furthermore psychosocial stress elicits a marked increase in eating behavior in the post-stress phase. Subjects ingested more carbohydrates without any preference for sweet ingredients. These experimentally observed changes of cerebral demand, supply and need are integrated into a logistic framework describing the supply chain of the selfish brain.",

We assessed clinical and immunologic features of and breastfeeding advice provided to mother\u2013infant pairs. This observational analysis was conducted in a tertiary-care centre in Wuhan, China. Pregnant patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 who delivered during hospitalization were enrolled. Clinical characteristics and serial specimens of the mother\u2013infant pairs were examined, supplemented with follow-ups regarding recovery and breastfeeding. Fourteen pregnant patients had live births and recovered well; four patients continued breastfeeding while taking precautions. No neonatal infections were observed. No infants developed COVID-19 during breastfeeding. Common maternal symptoms were fever (11/14, 78.1%) and cough (6/14, 42.9%). A pregnancy-specific symptom was abnormal foetal movement, which was noticed by three patients (21.4%). The mean virus shedding time was 9 days (standard deviation, 6 days; range, 1\u201322 days). The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) genome was not detected in breast milk or maternal vaginal secretions. Immunologic assay revealed seroconversion of IgM on day 8 after onset and IgG on day 28. Both IgM and IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were detected in breast milk, cord blood and neonatal serum. The study results suggest that passive acquisition of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 is available by ingesting breast milk. Breastfeeding has a low risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 or escalating maternal disease, so continuing breastfeeding with prudent precautions is encouraged.",

However, EBF rate for India remained low at 54.9% during 2015\u20132016. It is therefore essential to understand the reasons for such a low EBF rate in the country so that appropriate interventions can be developed and implemented. (1) To estimate the prevalence of EBF in rural community of central Gujarat and (2) to identify barriers to EBF in this community. A community-based cross sectional study was conducted among mothers of 330 infants of age 6 months to 1 year using pretested questionnaire. Two-stage cluster sampling technique was used to select the sample. \u03c7 2 test, t -test, and logistic regression were applied to assess the significance of associations. EBF rate in the studied population was detected to be 49.7%. Early marriage of parents, less educated parents, male child, Christian religion, working mother, less number of antenatal visits, operative delivery, late initiation of breastfeeding, not feeding colostrum, lack of knowledge about EBF, and poor counseling of mother regarding EBF were identified as barriers to EBF. Prevalence of EBF was found to be lower than the national average in the rural community of central Gujarat. Effective strategies at local, state, and national levels should aim at addressing the barriers to EBF that are identified in this study.",

There were no significant median changes in total ghrelin or pancreatic peptide concentrations between conditions. There were also no median differences in subjective appetite ratings or energy intake between conditions, but the median change in explicit liking of sweet versus savory foods differed significantly between pre-exercise and 24 h post exercise ( p = .013). Post-hoc analysis observed a significant difference in the pre-exercise to 24 h post exercise change between front running and downhill running ( p = .023), and indicated greater liking of savory foods over sweet foods in downhill running than front running. However, no further differences were seen between conditions for the remaining food preference parameters, suggesting there were no systematic trends in these data. In conclusion, there was no effect of front and downhill running on eating behavior as compared to a nonexercise control condition, but these data need to be replicated in a larger and more heterogeneous sample.",

Twenty-four sows [(Landrace \u00d7 Yorkshire); BW 216.70 \u00b1 3.98 kg; parity 3.04 \u00b1 0.53] were balanced for parity and randomly assigned to 1 of 3 feeding frequency regimes.

Sows received 7055 kcal ME/d during gestation from 2.21 kg of diet formulated to contain SID Lys/ME of 1.71 g/Mcal. Saliva samples were collected every 2 hr from 0630 to 1830 hours on day 52 and assayed for cortisol using ELISA procedure. Behavior data were collected for 7 d from day 53 of gestation by affixing a remote insights ear tag to each sow. Each sow had 120,960 data points categorized into: \u201cActive\u201d, \u201cFeed,\u201d or \u201cDormant\u201d. Because of housing constraint, all sows were housed in individual stalls in the same room presenting a potential limitation of the study. The data were analyzed using PROC MIXED and GLIMMIX procedures of SAS 9.4 for cortisol and behavior count data, respectively. Sow was the experimental unit. The area under the curve (AUC) is quantitative evaluation of response as threshold varies over all possible values. The T2 sows had reduced 12-hr cortisol AUC compared with control sows ( P = 0.024) and T3 sows ( P = 0.004), respectively. The T2 sows had lower 3 hr ( P = 0.039) and 5 hr ( P = 0.015) postfeeding cortisol AUC compared with control sows. Feed anticipatory activity (FAA), 24-hr total activity, and feeding activities (eating and/or sham chewing) were reduced for T2 sows relative to the control and T3 sows ( P < 0.01). Consequently, T2 sows had lower 24-hr total activity ( P < 0.001) and feeding activities ( P < 0.001) AUC compared with both the control and T3 sows, respectively. The T3 sows had greater FAA ( P < 0.001) and 24-hr total activity AUC ( P = 0.010) compared with control sows. Our data although inconclusive due to small sample size, twice daily feeding appears to be the threshold that reduces sows\u2019 total activity AUC, feeding activity AUC, and activation of hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013adrenal axis, reduced hunger, and exhibit potential to improve sow welfare in relation to once and thrice daily feeding regimes under isocaloric intake per kilogram live metabolic weight.",

We examined whether sex, race, parental history of alcohol problems, age of onset, type of alcohol consumed, drinking company, and subjective response to alcohol were associated with 1) delay to first binge episode and 2) binge drinking status (i.e., never bingers, individuals who binge drank on their first drinking occasion, and individuals who binge drank at a later date). Finally, we examined whether first-occasion bingers reported heavier drinking and alcohol-related problems than later-occasion and never bingers. Overall, a shorter delay was associated with being male an older age of onset, and, during one's first drinking experience, consuming liquor, drinking with friends or alone, and experiencing high arousal negative alcohol effects. First-occasion bingers were more likely to be male, consume liquor, and experience stronger high arousal positive and negative alcohol effects than never bingers and to have a later age of onset, experience stronger high arousal negative, and weaker low arousal negative alcohol effects than later-occasion bingers. First-occasion bingers also reported heavier current drinking and more alcohol-related problems. Characteristics of underage drinkers that confer risk for a shorter delay and first-occasion binging may provide fruitful targets for intervention, as efforts to delay binge drinking may mitigate alcohol-related risk associated with underage alcohol use. \u2022 A short delay to drinking to intoxication confers alcohol-related risk among youth. \u2022 We examined predictors of a short delay from alcohol onset to first binge episode. \u2022 Male sex, an older age of onset, and drinking liquor predicted a shorter delay. \u2022 Drinking with friends/alone and high arousal negative alcohol effects predicted delay. \u2022 Adolescents who binge drank at drinking onset were at risk for heavier alcohol use.

An example is homeostatic temperature regulation (thermoregulation). Many model organisms, from flies to mice, regulate internal temperatures in part by moving to suitable climates (thermotaxis). A particularly reliable method of quantifying temperature-dependent thermotactic behaviors is the two-temperature preference behavioral assay. In this preparation, an organism is free to move between two temperature-controlled surfaces, thus revealing its preferred thermal environment. Here we present the design and construction of a two-temperature preference assay chamber. The device uses Peltier-based thermoelectric modules (TECs) for heating and cooling, and is capable of precision control of temperatures from \u22125\u00baC to 60\u00baC. Our approach can be easily adapted for use in a variety of physiological and behavioral assays that require precise temperature control over a wide range of temperatures.",

    "abstract": "The spatio-temporal attachment site patterns of ticks feeding on their hosts can be of significance if co-feeding transmission (i.e. from tick to tick without a systemic infection of the host) of pathogens affects the persistence of a given disease. Using tick infestation data on roe deer, we analysed preferred attachment sites and niche width of Ixodes ticks (larvae, nymphs, males, females) and investigated the degree of inter- and intrastadial aggregation. The different development stages showed rather consistent attachment site patterns and relative narrow feeding site niches. Larvae were mostly found on the head and on the front legs of roe deer, nymphs reached highest densities on the head and highest adult densities were found on the neck of roe deer. The tick stages feeding (larvae, nymphs, females) on roe deer showed high degrees of intrastadial spatial aggregation, whereas males did not. Male ticks showed large feeding site overlap with female ticks. Feeding site overlap between larval-female and larval-nymphal ticks did occur especially during the months May\u2013August on the head and front legs of roe deer and might allow pathogen transmission via co-feeding. Tick density, niche width and niche overlap on roe deer are mainly affected by seasonality, reflecting seasonal activity and abundance patterns of ticks. Since different tick development stages occur spatially and temporally clustered on roe deer, transmission experiments of tick-borne pathogens are urgently needed.",

In people, lower esophageal sphincter (LES) disorders causing functional obstruction are rare causes of ME that may respond to targeted treatment. Functional LES disorders are reported rarely in dogs because of challenges in diagnostic methodologies. To identify dogs with videofluoroscopic swallow study (VFSS) features of LES achalasia\u2010like syndrome (LES\u2010AS). We hypothesized that dogs with LES\u2010AS could be distinguished from normal dogs using standardized VFSS criteria. Dogs with LES\u2010AS by VFSS (n = 19), healthy normal dogs (n = 20). Retrospective study. One\u2010hundred thirty dogs presented to the University of Missouri Veterinary Health Center (MU\u2010VHC) between April 2015 and December 2017 for a free\u2010feeding VFSS; 20 healthy dogs were included as controls. Swallow studies were evaluated for failure of the LES to relax during pharyngeal swallow (LES\u2010AS). Affected dogs subsequently were evaluated using standardized criteria to identify metrics important for identifying and characterizing dogs with LES\u2010AS. Nineteen dogs with LES\u2010AS were identified out of 130 VFSS. Megaesophagus was present in 14 of 19 (73.7%) dogs with LES\u2010AS.

    "abstract": "Traditionally, breakfast skipping (BS), and recently late-night dinner eating (LNDE), have attracted attention in public health because they can predispose to cardiometabolic conditions such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Intriguingly, it has become evident that short duration of sleep elicits similar health risks. As LNDE, BS, and short sleep can be closely related and can aggravate each other, these three should not be considered separately. In this context, LNDE (or its equivalents, snacking or heavy alcohol consumption after dinner) and BS may be representative unhealthy eating habits around sleep (UEHAS). While it is important to take energy in the early morning for physical and intellectual activities, attaining a fasting state is essential for metabolic homeostasis. Our previous UEHAS studies have shown that BS without LNDE, i.e ., BS alone, is not associated with obesity and diabetes, suggesting the possibility that BS or taking a very low energy breakfast, which could yield fasting for a while, may prevent obesity and diabetes in people with inevitable LNDE. Further studies considering UEHAS and short sleep simultaneously are needed to elucidate the effects of these unhealthy lifestyles on cardiometabolic diseases.",

Adults with body mass index \u2a7e30\u2009kg\u2009m \u22122 and binge eating scale scores \u2a7e19 received 1-week single-blind placebo run-in, and were then randomized to 28 days with either 2\u2009mg\u2009day \u22121 GSK1521498, 5\u2009mg\u2009day \u22121 GSK1521498 or placebo ( N =21 per arm) in a double-blind parallel group design. The outcome measures were body weight, fat mass, hedonic and consummatory eating behaviour during inpatient food challenges, safety and pharmacokinetics. The primary analysis was the comparison of change scores in the higher-dose treatment group versus placebo using analysis of covariance at each relevant time point. GSK1521498 (2\u2009mg and 5\u2009mg) was not different from placebo in its effects on weight, fat mass and binge eating scores. However, compared with placebo, GSK1521498 5\u2009mg\u2009day \u22121 caused a significant reduction in hedonic responses to sweetened dairy products and reduced calorific intake, particularly of high-fat foods during ad libitum buffet meals, with some of these effects correlating with systemic exposure of GSK1521498.

Breast pump provision has been used as an incentive for breastfeeding, although effectiveness is unclear. Women's use of breast pumps is increasing and a high proportion of mothers express breastmilk. No research has yet reported women's and health professionals' perspectives on breast pumps as an incentive for breastfeeding.

    "abstract": "We aimed to investigate practices of nasogastric tube (NGT) intubation and feeding for adults by clinical nurses in China. A self-designed and validated questionnaire comprising 30 questions was distributed to 560 clinical nurses in three comprehensive hospitals of Xiamen, China. The questionnaire covered participants\u2019 demographic characteristics, NGT placement, administration of enteral nutrition (EN), and monitoring or management of feeding intolerance. A total 464 (82.9%) questionnaires were completed; 36.2% of nurses used nose\u2013ear\u2013xiphoid and 79.5% forehead\u2013xiphoid measurement to define the internal length of the NGT. Many participants still used traditional methods to confirm NGT placement (auscultation of injected air 50.2%, bubble test 34.7% and observing feeding tube aspirate 34.3%). Bolus feeding was the most commonly used technique to administer EN. A total 97.0% of all nurses used syringes to measure gastric residual volume (GRV), and 62.7% measured GRV every 4\u20138 hours. The most frequently used GRV threshold values were 200\u2009mL (44.6%) and 150\u2009mL (25.2%). Most nurses stopped feeding immediately when encountering high GRV (84.3%) or diarrhea (45.0%). The nasogastric feeding practices of many clinical nurses were not consistent with international guidelines. Our study can provide an impetus for nursing administrators to revise their nasogastric feeding procedures, to promote compliance with evidence-based guidelines.",

    "abstract": "The hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) are traditionally associated with regulating memory and executive function, respectively. The contribution of these brain regions to food intake control, however, is poorly understood. The present study identifies a novel neural pathway through which monosynaptic glutamatergic ventral hippocampal field CA1 (vCA1) to mPFC connectivity inhibits food-motivated behaviors through vCA1 glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R). Results demonstrate that vCA1-targeted RNA interference-mediated GLP-1R knockdown increases motivated operant responding for palatable food. Chemogenetic disconnection of monosynaptic glutamatergic vCA1 to mPFC projections using designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs)-mediated synaptic silencing ablates the food intake and body weight reduction following vCA1 GLP-1R activation. Neuropharmacological experiments further reveal that vCA1 GLP-1R activation reduces food intake and inhibits impulsive operant responding for palatable food via downstream communication to mPFC NMDA receptors. Overall these findings identify a novel neural pathway regulating higher-order cognitive aspects of feeding behavior.",

This article aims to support shared decision\u2010making process for infant feeding and care with parents and health care providers during the unprecedented times of the pandemic. It proposes a structure and rationale to guide the process that includes (1) discussing with parents evidence\u2010based information and the different options to feed and care for an infant and young child in the context of the pandemic as well as their potential benefits, risks and scientific uncertainties; (2) helping parents to recognize the sensitive nature of the decisions and to clarify the value they place on the different options to feed and care for their infant or young child; and (3) providing guidance and support needed to make and implement their decisions. A shared decision\u2010making process will help parents navigate complex feeding and care decisions for their child as we face the different stages of the COVID\u201019 pandemic.",

    "abstract": "There is evidence of altered neural taste response in female adolescents who are obese, and in adolescents who are at risk for obesity. To further understand risk factors for the development of overeating and obesity, we investigated response to tastes of sucrose and water in 23 obese and healthy weight children. Thirteen healthy weight (HW) and 10 obese (OB) 8\u201312 year old children underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while tasting sucrose and water. Additionally, children completed an eating in the absence of hunger paradigm and a sucrose liking task. A region of interest analysis revealed an elevated BOLD response to taste (sucrose and water) within the bilateral insula and amygdala in OB children relative to HW children. Whole brain analyses revealed a group by condition interaction within the paracingulate, medial frontal, middle frontal gyri, and right amygdala: post hoc analyses suggested an increased response to sucrose for OB relative to HW children, whereas HW children responded more strongly to water relative to sucrose. In addition, OB children, relative to HW, tended to recruit the right putamen as well as medial and lateral frontal and temporal regions bilaterally. This study showed increased reactivity in the amygdala and insula in the OB compared to HW children, but no functional differentiation in the striatum, despite differences in the striatum previously seen in older samples. These findings support the concept of the association between increased neural processing of food reward in the development of obesity, and raise the possibility that emotional and interoceptive sensitivity could be an early vulnerability in obesity.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the question: what can the practice of yoga offer the field of eating disorders in terms of prevention and treatment? Regarding prevention, preliminary research suggests that yoga may be effective in decreasing risk factors, and increasing protective factors, for eating disorders. Yoga was also found to be helpful in a small number of treatment studies. However, findings are not consistent across studies, which are limited in number, and due to the preliminary nature of this body of research, most studies have weaknesses in their designs (e.g. observational design, no control groups, or small sample sizes). The basic tenets of yoga, anecdotal reports of its effectiveness, its high accessibility and low cost, and initial research findings suggest that yoga may offer promise for the field of eating disorders. Two options are suggested for prevention: (1) eating disorder prevention can be integrated into ongoing yoga classes and (2) yoga can be integrated into eating disorder prevention programmes. Regarding treatment, it is important to examine the effectiveness of different teaching styles and practices for different eating disorders. Potential harms of yoga should also be explored. Further research, using stronger study designs, such as randomised, controlled trials, is needed.",

The survey was conducted by means of a questionnaire distributed to 4th and 5th grade elementary school students (400 boys and 400 girls) in urban and suburban areas of Daejeon. The results of this study were as follows: male students in urban areas ate breakfast, unbalanced diets, and dairy products more frequently than male students in suburban areas (p < 0.05). Female students in urban areas ate dairy products (p < 0.01) and fruits (p < 0.001) more frequently than female students in suburban areas. Students had the high preferences for boiled rice and noodles with black bean sauce, beef rib soup, steamed beef rib, steamed egg, beef boiled in soy sauce, egg roll, bulgogi, pork cutlet, deep-fried pork covered with sweet and sour starchy sauce, and honeyed juice mixed with fruit as a punch. All students preferred kimchi, although students in the suburban areas preferred kimchi-fried rice (p < 0.05), and those in the urban areas preferred bean-paste soup (p < 0.01). Students in suburban areas showed a greater preference for seasoned bean sprouts and Altari kimchi. All of the students preferred fruits, rice cake made with glutinous rice, and pizza among other foods. Overall, there were distinct differences in the eating habits and food preferences of elementary school students according to the place of residence.",

A total of 280 patients from the EPIP were recruited for an on\u2010going longitudinal study examining cigarette smoking and alcohol habits. Only baseline data were used, pertaining to socio\u2010demographics, alcohol use, clinical symptomology, quality of life, and expectancies of alcohol use. Overall 23.9% (N = 67) reported ever binge drinking in their lifetime, and 11.4% (N = 32) had binged in the past 2 weeks. Controlling for all other socio\u2010demographic and clinical factors, binge drinking was significantly associated with higher education levels, having children, current or past history of cigarette smoking, and lower negative symptom scores. Binge drinkers were also more likely to endorse statements relating to the themes of enhancement seeking (ie, using alcohol to alter or enhance experiences in a pleasurable way), coping with distress, and socializing\u2010related expectancies of alcohol use. Similar to past studies, the prevalence of binge drinking among our first\u2010episode sample was relatively high. Our findings suggest certain lifestyle and social factors associated with risky drinking behaviour that future prevention efforts may address. Additionally, the three motivations of enhancement seeking, coping, and socializing also suggest psychological processes and coping styles that could be targeted for interventions.",

    "abstract": "As suffering from an eating disorder often entails restrictions on a person\u2019s everyday life, one can imagine that it is an important aspect of recovery to help young people learn to balance stressful demands and expectations in areas like the school environment and spare-time activities that include different forms of interpersonal relationships. The aim of the present study was to investigate how adolescents with experience from a restrictive eating disorder describe their illness and their time in treatment in relation to social contexts outside the family. This qualitative study is based on narratives of 15 adolescents with experience from outpatient treatment for eating disorders with a predominately restrictive symptomatology, recruited in collaboration with four specialized eating-disorder units. Data were explored through inductive thematic analysis. The adolescents\u2019 descriptions of their illness in relation to their social contexts outside the family follow a clear timeline that includes narratives about when and how the problem arose, time in treatment, and the process that led to recovery. Three main themes were found: 1) the problems emerging in everyday life (outside the family); 2) a life put on hold and 3) creating a new life context. Young people with eating disorders need to learn how to balance demands and stressful situations in life, and to grasp the confusion that often preceded their illness. How recovery progresses, and how the young people experience their life contexts after recovery, depends largely on the magnitude and quality of peer support and on how school and sports activities affect and are affected by the eating disorder.

Support for the role of self\u2010esteem in eating disorders is ambiguous and little is known about the influence of social status as judged by others. The present study investigates whether self\u2010esteem and peer status in early adolescence are associated with eating pathology in young adulthood. This study is part of TRAILS, a longitudinal cohort study on mental health and social development from preadolescence into adulthood. At age 11, participants completed the Self\u2010Perception Profile for Children, assessing global self\u2010esteem and self\u2010perceptions regarding social acceptance, physical appearance, and academic competence. At age 13, peer status among classmates was assessed regarding likeability, physical attractiveness, academic performance, and popularity in a subsample of 1,007 participants. The Eating Disorder Diagnostic Scale was administered at age 22. The present study included peer\u2010nominated participants with completed measures of self\u2010perception at age 11 and eating pathology at age 22 ( N =\u2009732; 57.8% female). In a combined model, self\u2010perceived physical attractiveness at age 11 and peer popularity at age 13 were inversely correlated with eating pathology at 22 years, while likeability by peers at age 13 was positively related to eating pathology. Both self\u2010perceptions and peer status in early adolescence are significant predictors of eating pathology in young adults. Specific measures of self\u2010esteem and peer\u2010perceived status may be more relevant to the prediction of eating pathology than a global measure of self\u2010esteem.",

In adult male elite athletes, ED prevalence rates up to 32.5% were found, higher than in the general population. Prevalence was not higher in young/adolescent male elite athletes. The most frequently associated factor was competing in weight-sensitive sports. Male elite athletes tended to exhibit less body dissatisfaction than controls and were not always associated with DE. There were no studies looking at the prognosis or reporting an evidence-based approach for the management of DE in male elite athletes.

Iron, total iron-binding capacity, and ferritin were measured, and transferrin saturation was calculated. As there were no differences in the mean values between boys and girls, we established the reference intervals for 1-yr-old children regardless of sex. The analysis of serum iron status according to feeding methods during the first six months revealed higher iron, ferritin, and transferrin saturation levels in children exclusively or mainly fed formula than in children exclusively or mainly fed breast milk. We established reference intervals of hematology and clinical chemistry analytes from community-based healthy children at one year of age.

Multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine the associated factors for exclusive breastfeeding practices. We found an association between the mutual decision of parents on exclusive breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding practices. Previous exclusive breastfeeding experience, fathers' ages, mothers' occupations and mutual decisions had significant impact on exclusive breastfeeding practices. The important determinant for practising exclusive breastfeeding is parents' mutual decisions.

This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of EDs among the individuals attending weight management centers and its associated factors. A cross-sectional study was carried out among individuals attending four weight management centers in Tanta, Gharbia Governorate, Egypt during the period from July to December 2016. Precoded interview questionnaires were used to identify the following data: sociodemographic characteristics and medical history of depression or psychological disorders and the Eating Attitude Test (EAT-40) was used to assess the attitudes, behavior, and traits associated with the EDs. A total of 400 participants (112 males and 288 females) were included in the study. According to EAT-40 questionnaires, the prevalence of positive and negative EDs was 65.0% ( n = 260) and 35.0% ( n = 140), respectively. EDs were more likely reported by females, married singles, rural residents, those with higher education, and nonworking or part-time working patients, those who were overweight or obese, and who were suffering from depression or any psychological problems. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the independent predictors of EDs were age (adjusted odds ratio [ OR ]: 1.06), nonworking (adjusted OR : 2.32) or part-time working (adjusted OR : 2.18), increased body weight (adjusted OR : 2.66 for overweight and adjusted OR : 1.24 for obese), and having a history of depression or any psychological problem (adjusted OR : 2.76).

    "abstract": "Current nutrition therapy recommendations for the prevention and treatment of diabetes are based on a systematic review of evidence and answer important nutrition care questions. First, is diabetes nutrition therapy effective? Clinical trials as well as systematic and Cochrane reviews report a ~1%\u20132% lowering of hemoglobin A 1c values as well as other beneficial outcomes from nutrition therapy interventions, depending on the type and duration of diabetes and level of glycemic control. Clinical trials also provide evidence for the effectiveness of nutrition therapy in the prevention of diabetes. Second, are weight loss interventions important and when are they beneficial? Modest weight loss is important for the prevention of type 2 diabetes and early in the disease process. However, as diabetes progresses, weight loss may or may not result in beneficial glycemic and cardiovascular outcomes. Third, are there ideal percentages of macronutrients and eating patterns that apply to all persons with diabetes? There is no ideal percentage of macronutrients and a variety of eating patterns has been shown to be effective for persons with diabetes. Treatment goals, personal preferences (eg, tradition, culture, religion, health beliefs, economics), and the individual\u2019s ability and willingness to make lifestyle changes must all be considered by clinicians and/or educators when counseling and educating individuals with diabetes. A healthy eating pattern emphasizing nutrient-dense foods in appropriate portion sizes, regular physical activity, and support are priorities for all individuals with diabetes. Reduced energy intake for persons with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes as well as matching insulin to planned carbohydrate intake are intervention to be considered. Fourth, is the question of how to implement nutrition therapy interventions in clinical practice. This requires nutrition care strategies.",

Therefore, determining the cause of PVG requires further clinical evaluation in these cases. We report the case of a very\u2010low\u2010birth\u2010weight infant who underwent UVC after birth. PVG was an unexpected finding on ultrasound following catheterization. The UVC was immediately removed and replaced with a peripherally inserted central catheter. The infant\u2019s physical examination was unremarkable. Bedside X\u2010ray revealed neither PVG nor pneumatosis intestinalis, which would indicate the onset of necrotizing enterocolitis. After full evaluation, breastfeeding was started on the same day. The infant did not develop feeding intolerance, necrotizing enterocolitis, or other disorders. PVG occasionally occurs in neonates who undergo UVC and is considered to be caused by exogenous gases. PVG is more easily detected with ultrasound than with X\u2010ray and does not affect early feeding in premature infants.",

    "abstract": "Objectives: The aim of this study is to explore the safety and feasibility of early oral feeding (EOF) on short-term postoperative outcomes. Trial design: A prospective randomized non-inferiority trial. Materials and methods: From August 27, 2015 to March 31, 2017, 100 consecutive patients with gastric cancer in Xijing Hospital were recruited. Patients undergoing total laparoscopic radical gastrectomy (TLRG) received either EOF group or delayed oral feeding (DOF group). The endpoints were anastomotic leakage, the recovery of bowel function, the postoperative complications and costs. The process of randomization used a computer-generated sequence that was kept in a sealed envelope by a nurse that did not participate in the trial. None of the participants, administrators of interventions and those assessing outcomes was blinded. Results: Ultimately, 51 patients were in EOF group and 49 in DOF group, which both are comparable. The postoperative hospital stay in EOF group was significantly lower than DOF group (5.18\u00b11.47 days vs 6.18\u00b12.46 days, P =0.016). Furthermore, there was a trend for a reduction in the time of first flatus (10.3 hrs) and defecation (12.7 hrs) in EOF group compared to DOF group, but it was not statistically significant. Meanwhile, there were no significant differences in postoperative complications between two groups. One patient in the EOF group developed a fistula in the surgical remnant, which was recorded as other leakages; there was no difference between the two groups ( P =0.582). Conclusion: EOF does not seem to be more harmful than DOF, and might significantly improve the short-term outcomes for patients receiving TLRG.",

Here, we investigate the function of pharyngeal sweet gustatory receptor neurons (GRNs), demonstrating that they express a subset of the nine previously identified sweet receptors and respond to stimulation with a panel of sweet compounds. We show that pox-neuro ( poxn ) mutants lacking taste function in the legs and labial palps have intact pharyngeal sweet taste, which is both necessary and sufficient to drive preferred consumption of sweet compounds by prolonging ingestion. Moreover, flies putatively lacking all sweet taste show little preference for nutritive or non-nutritive sugars in a short-term feeding assay. Together, our data demonstrate that pharyngeal sense organs play an important role in directing sustained consumption of sweet compounds, and suggest that post-ingestive sugar sensing does not effectively drive food choice in a simple short-term feeding paradigm.",

We aimed to investigate whether the relationship between breastfeeding and sensitization to aeroallergens is modified by cluster of differentiation 14 (CD14) genotype. This study included 1,828 school children aged 9-12. We administered a detailed questionnaire and genotyped the CD14C-159T polymorphism. Skin prick tests for 12 aeroallergens were performed. School children who had been breastfed were less likely sensitized to aeroallergens (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.712, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.555-0.914). There was no significant association between CD14C-159T genotype and atopy. Breastfeeding was associated with a decreased risk of atopic sensitization in children with CT/CC genotype (aOR 0.667, 95% CI: 0.463-0.960).

The study investigates stigmatizing beliefs and attitudes towards Anorexia nervosa (AN) and Bulimia nervosa (BN). From October 2018 to November 2019, an online survey was conducted for students of the Degree Courses in Nursing of 2 Italian university centres, using the Italian version of the SAB-BN-ITA, adapted for AN. The sample consists of 517 nursing students, aged between 20 and 23. Male subjects presented higher scores, relative to stigma, both for BN (F =17.5, p <0.001) and for AN (F = 1 9.64, p <0.001). For the sample the main trigger factor of BN is the influence of the media (56.67), the lack of social support (53.19) and parental care (51.84). The association between the stigmatizing views was explored through Spearman\u2019s correlation and a linear regression model between the two overall scores (coeff. 0.73; p <0.001: r-squared 0.52). The \u2018self-regulation\u2019 is the stigmatizing opinions for AN (Coeff. 0.0768; p <0.001; r-squared 0.039) and BN (Coeff 0.0684; p <0.001; r-squared 0.030), and the \u2018social support\u2019 is stigmatizing opinions for AN (coeff. -0.0713; p = 0.004; r-squared 0.016). The study shows that the male gender has a higher level of stigma than the female one.

The pathogen 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is now named SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is highly infectious. As of Apr. 9, 2020, over 80 000 confirmed cases had been reported, with an estimated mortality rate of 4.0% (Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020 ).

However, there is no evidence of fetal intrauterine infection in pregnant women who have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 in their third trimester (Chen et al., 2020 ). It is unclear whether breastfeeding transmits the virus from previously infected and recovered mothers to their babies. Here we report the clinical course of a pregnant woman with COVID-19.

Breastfeeding practice is multifactorial, and numerous variables influence mothers\u2019 decisions and ability to breastfeed. This review identifies the factors potentially affecting the timely initiation of breastfeeding within an hour after birth and exclusive breastfeeding in the first 6\u2009months in Middle Eastern countries. The Medline, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science databases were keyword-searched for primary studies meeting the following inclusion criteria: (1) publication in the English language between January 2001 and May 2017, (2) original research articles reporting primary data on the factors influencing the timely initiation of breastfeeding and/or exclusive breastfeeding, (3) the use of World Health Organization definitions, and (4) Middle Eastern research contexts. A random effect model was used to establish the average prevalence of the timely initiation of breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding in the Middle East. The review identified 19 studies conducted in Saudi Arabia (7), Iran (3), Egypt (2), Turkey (2), Kuwait (1), the United Arab Emirates (1), Qatar (1), Lebanon (1), and Syria (1). The meta-analysis established that 34.3% (confidence interval [CI]: 20.2%-51.9%) of Middle Eastern newborns received breastfeeding initiated within an hour of birth, and only 20.5% (CI: 14.5%-28.2%) were fed only breast milk for the first 6\u2009months. The 8 studies exploring breastfeeding initiation most commonly associated it with the following: delivery mode, maternal employment, rooming-in, and prelacteal feeding. The 17 studies investigating exclusive breastfeeding most frequently linked it to the following: maternal age, maternal education, maternal employment, and delivery mode. Middle Eastern health care organizations should fully understand all the determinants of breastfeeding identified by this review to provide suitable practical guidance and advice to help new mothers to overcome barriers where possible and to contribute to improving infant and maternal health in the region.",

The objective of this research was to investigate feeding behaviors of broilers provided with 4 feeder spaces, that are 2.3\u00a0cm/bird with one feeder (2.3FSO); and 2.3, 4.6, and 6.9\u00a0cm/bird with 3 feeders (2.3FST, 4.6FST, and 6.9FST, respectively). Number of feeder slots per feeder was 14 at 2.3FSO, 5 at 2.3FST, 9 at 4.6FST, and 14 at 6.9FST. Sixteen identical pens, each with 45 broilers (Ross 708, mixed sex), were used to accommodate the 4 feeder space treatments. Feeding behaviors were continuously monitored from weeks 4 to 8 using an ultra-high-frequency radio frequency identification system. The results show that the daily feeding time and number of feeder visits for broilers at 2.3FST were similar to those at 4.6FST and 6.9FST but higher than those at 2.3FSO ( P < 0.01). The feeder utilization ratio was the highest at 2.3FST, indicating the feeder being used most efficiently among the 4 treatments ( P < 0.01). Coefficient of variations (33.0\u201365.1%) of the feeding behavior responses was similar among the treatments (P \u2265 0.06), suggesting similar group uniformity of feeding behaviors of individual broilers. Feeders among all treatments may not be fully used because for most of the time, less than 6 birds chose to eat simultaneously at a more-than-five-slot feeder in all treatments. Given the same feeder space, increasing feeder number can accommodate more birds to eat simultaneously. The outcomes of this study provide insights into improvement of feeder design and management for broiler production.",

    "abstract": "Research conducted to date into the primary prevention of eating disorders (ED) has mainly considered the provision of information regarding risk factors. Consequently, there is a need to develop new methods that go a step further, promoting a change in attitudes and behavior in the target population. This study describes an adaptation of the Girls\u2019 Group model to the Spanish context, the main objective being to compare two types of intervention, ie, one based on this model and the other following the traditional approach of providing information. The ultimate aim was to implement a prevention program that reduces the risk factors and boosts the protection factors that have been empirically shown to be related to ED. On the basis of previous research on the primary prevention of ED, and taking into account recognized risk and protective factors, the following topics were addressed: nutritional aspects; self-esteem; coping strategies; the ideal image of what is attractive and role of the media; and body image. The total sample (174 girls and 197 boys) was divided into 12 work groups, six for the intervention group (one school) and six for the control group (two schools). School-based input (intervention group) was provided by a pharmacist, a psychologist, a qualified nutritionist/dietician, and specialist support staff (psychologists and/or educators) and teachers of the three schools. Participation in the intervention group reduced body dissatisfaction (F = 13.41; P < 0.01), the drive to thinness (F = 10.79; P < 0.01), and the influence of the media with respect to the esthetic body shape model (F = 13.90; P < 0.01), while self-esteem (F = 7.34; P < 0.01) and the use of coping strategies (F = 13.74; P < 0.01) both improved. There was also an improvement in the eating habits of participants, with better outcomes being achieved when intervening with females. The present study shows that in the primary prevention of eating disorders, better outcomes are achieved by new models which target the attitudes and behavior of adolescents rather than focusing solely on the provision of risk information to raise awareness.",

UK students aged 18\u201330 ( n =\u00a0155) completed the: (1) the Urgency, Pre-meditation, Perseverance, Sensation Seeking (UPPS-P) negative urgency subscale; (2) Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT); and (3) Binge-Eating Scale (BES). For categorical analysis, participants were assigned to one of four groups as a function of AUDIT and BES clinical cut-off scores: (1) no risk (28%); (2) risky drinkers (47%); (3) binge-eaters (6%); and (4) risky drinkers\u00a0+\u00a0binge-eaters (19%). For dimensional analysis, across students with non-zero AUDIT and BES scores ( n =\u00a0141), BES, AUDIT, gender, and their interactions were entered as predictors in the same block of a regression. UPPS-P negative urgency was the dependent variable. Categorical results indicated that binge-eaters with and without risky drinking endorsed significantly higher negative urgency than students with no risk. Dimensional results showed that although higher BES and AUDIT scores were positively linked to higher negative urgency, but only the BES was significantly associated. Furthermore, BES shared substantially more variance with negative urgency than the AUDIT, and the BES-negative urgency relationship was stronger in male students than female students. High risk students may benefit the most from interventions that help regulate negative emotion.",

    "abstract": "Topiramate is an anticonvulsant drug used for the treatment of epilepsy and prophylaxis of migraine. Some authors have proposed its use as a mood stabilizer and have reported its efficacy in reducing impulsiveness and improving mood regulation, possibly via its antagonism to glutamatergic transmission in the lateral hypothalamus, although this indication is still controversial. Weight loss is a side effect consistently reported in the medical literature in patients treated with topiramate. Given its potential role in stabilizing mood and reducing impulse control problems and weight, topiramate has been proposed as a treatment for obese patients with binge eating disorder (BED). The aim of this paper is to review published data on the efficacy and safety of topiramate for the treatment of obese subjects with BED. Although the evidence is preliminary, topiramate appears to be a relatively safe and effective treatment for obese subjects with BED. Limitations of the studies and future directions for research are discussed.",

Seventeen young adults with ASD and IDs, six parents, and 10 staff participated. Programming was delivered for over a year and featured healthy eating and exercise lessons. Also, group-based motivational interviewing was used to develop weekly health goals for participants. During COVID-19, lessons were delivered online. The program was modified using lectures with visual material, when participants returned to classrooms. Lessons focused on MyPlate, portion sizes, the food pyramid, vitamins and minerals in foods, and learning to eat \u201cless\u201d of unhealthy food groups. Exercise lessons featured information about importance of exercise, introduction to different types of exercise, and knowledge about how exercise benefits the body. Staff completed implementation logs. Height and weight of participants were examined at regular intervals. Parents completed surveys and participants completed group interviews to assess program impact. Two participants lost a significant amount of weight and others maintained their weight during COVID-19. Participants and parents were satisfied with the program and reported knowledge and behavior change. Results indicated participating in the intervention resulted in improved knowledge and health behaviors. Findings are preliminary, and research using control groups and assessing change in weight and behaviors over time are needed. Observation of meals and physical activity levels will provide more objective data in future studies.",

This study aimed to investigate the association between caregivers' oral hygiene behavior with AsP in the community dysphagia persons with nasogastric tube feeding (DPNgTF). A cross-sectional study was conducted on 128 DPNgTF and their corresponding caregivers. A self-reported structuralized questionnaire was used to measure the oral care behavior of caregivers. All data analyses were performed using the SPSS. The Chi-square was used for comparison of nonparametric data. Fisher's exact test was used when the expected frequency of any cell in the table was less than five. A p value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Fifty-five DPNgTF had developed AsP (43.0%) and they had statistically significantly halitosis (adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a04.46; 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a02.01\u20139.93), deposition of oropharyngeal secretion (OR\u00a0=\u00a04.39; 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.99\u20139.66), dry mouth (OR\u00a0=\u00a04.23; 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.81\u20139.85) and closing mouth and not allow to brush (adjusted OR\u00a0=\u00a02.83; 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.28\u20136.27). The poor oral hygiene status of DPNgTF was significantly correlated with the occurrence of AsP. The caregivers' oral care to DPNgTF after getting up (OR\u00a0=\u00a014.09; 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a02.92\u201368.08) and using sponge stick to care (OR\u00a0=\u00a03.29; 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.26\u20138.55) were the risk factors of AsP. The implemented oral care after getting up only, using sponge stick has a higher risk compared to the implemented oral care prior to sleeping, using toothbrush. The importance of implementing oral care prior to sleeping by using toothbrush should be reinforced in DPNgTF. Guidelines of oral care and education courses for caregivers during the process in their career training are needed.",

The study employed a prospective, randomized, controlled trial design. The 4-month intervention consisted of self-guided HAPA-based workbooks in addition to two telephone calls to assist participants with the program implementation, and was compared to \u201ctreatment as usual\u201d. Participants (n=87) completed health measures (diet, body mass index [BMI], waist circumference, blood pressure, blood glucose levels, lipid levels, and diabetes distress) and HAPA measures prior to the intervention and again upon completion 4 months later. The overall HAPA model predicted BMI, although only risk awareness and recovery self-efficacy were significant independent contributors. Risk awareness, intentions, and self-efficacy were also independent predictors of health outcomes; however, the HAPA did not predict healthy eating. No significant time \u00d7 condition interaction effects were found for diet or any HAPA outcome measures. Despite the success of HAPA in predicting health outcomes for those with type 2 diabetes mellitus, the intervention was unsuccessful in changing healthy eating or any of the other measured variables, and alternative low-cost health interventions for those with type 2 diabetes mellitus should be explored.",

This comorbidity presents a clinical dilemma as current treatment approaches for PCOS emphasize the importance of weight management, diet, exercise, and the potential for harm of such treatment approaches in PCOS patients with comorbid disordered eating. However, limited research has assessed the occurrence of binge eating and disordered eating in PCOS patients. Consequently, little is known about the prevalence of binge eating in PCOS, and the possible etiological processes to explain this comorbidity remain poorly understood. Given the paucity of research on this topic, the aims of this narrative review are fourfold: 1) to outline the main symptoms of PCOS and binge eating; 2) to provide an overview of the prevalence of binge eating in PCOS; 3) to outline possible etiological factors for the comorbidity between PCOS and binge eating; and 4) to provide an overview of management strategies of binge eating in PCOS.",

We intended to analyze our experience over the past 3 years of period and to discuss the advantages of rooming-in. We analyzed the rooming-in practice rate, failure rate, and the breast feeding rate. Subjects were 860 normal healthy neonates from June 2006 to June 2009. Among these 860 cases, 83 babies were required separation out of rooming-in in the middle of the course. Among these 83 cases, 70 cases had to stop the course due to poor condition of babies and 13 cases due to maternal condition. 70 cases of infant's causes consist of 68 cases of NICU admission and 2 cases of poor feeding support. The other 13 cases of separation include refusal by maternal condition. Therefore the success rate of rooming-in for the last 3 years was 90.3%, that is 777 cases among the total 860 cases. The percentage of exclusive breast feeding was 64%, that of mixed feeding with breast and formula feeding was 25%, and formula feeding only was 11%. We experienced successful rooming-in care for the last 3 years. Nursery facilities should educate and encourage the advantages of rooming-in, including the good formation of attachment between mother and infant, emotional stability, protection from infection, and increased breast feeding rate so that rooming-in care can be fully established.",

The study sample comprised 320 caregivers of preschool children aged 3\u20136 years, who were attending the public preschools in Bangpakong, Chachoengsao, and they completed self-administered questionnaires. The questionnaires had information about demographic data, weaning status, the feeding practices for children who were still on a bottle, and the caregivers\u2019 attitudes on bottle feeding according to weaning status. Of these children, 38.4% were still on a bottle while 61.6% had been weaned. Mean age at the weaning time was 3.1 \u00b1 0.6 years. The most common reason that led caregivers of bottle feeding group to allow continuation of the habit was the child refused to wean. Of these caregivers, 56% lacked knowledge concerning the appropriate weaning time and that the use of bottles should be actively discouraged for children after 1 year of age. Attitudes between bottle feeding and weaned groups were significantly different ( P < 0.05) in the following: a child should be introduced to drink from cup after 1 year of age, nursing bottle works best to stop a child from crying, early weaning results in poor mental health, and early weaning results in malnutrition. Prolonged bottle feeding beyond the recommended age was found in the majority of preschool children in this study.

This is a clinical trial with a quantitative design conducted on 69 premature infants (gestational age between 29 and 32 weeks) who were assigned to cup ( n = 34) and palady ( n = 35) feeding groups through random allocation. The first feeding was administrated either by cup or palady method in each shift within seven sequential days (total of 21 cup and palady feedings). Then, the rest of feeding was administrated by gavage. Mean hospitalization time (cup = 39.01 and palady = 30.4; P < 0.001) and mean time interval to reach full oral feeding (cup = 33.7 and palady = 24.1; P < 0.001) were significantly lower in palady group compared to cup group. Mean weight changes of neonates 7 weeks after the intervention compared to those in the beginning of the intervention were significantly more in palady group compared to the cup group (cup = 146.7 and palady = 198.8; P < 0.001). The neonates in palady group reached full oral feeding earlier than those of cup group. Subjects\u2019 weight gain was also higher in palady group compared to the cup group.

We included 74 incident cases in women with histologically confirmed diagnoses of adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus, and 74 female controls matched by age and general practice. High body mass index (BMI) around the age of 20 years (highest vs lowest quartile, adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 6.04, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28\u201328.52) and low consumption of fruit (highest vs lowest quartile, adjusted OR = 0.08, 95% Cl 0.01\u20130.49) were associated with increases in risk.

    "abstract": "Feeding management in horses suggests feeding horses in advance of exercise, particularly the grain portion of the diet. Plasma amino acids ( AA ) peak at 3 to 6 h postfeeding depending on the AA. The timeframe between feeding and exercise may affect the availability of AA during and after exercise. The purpose of this study was to observe the differences in plasma AA in horses fed prior to exercise or after exercise. Eight light type horses were fed a diet with adequate protein and AA for horses in light to moderate exercise. After an adjustment period, horses completed a standardized exercise test ( SET ). Relative to the SET, horses were fed either 2 h prior ( PRE horses) to the SET, 1 h after completing the SET ( POST horses), or horses remained fasted throughout the sampling period ( FASTED horses). Plasma was drawn prior to exercise, at the peak of exercise as well as at 1, 2, 4, and 7 h postexercise. Plasma was analyzed for AA, glucose, lactate, creatinine, creatine kinase, ammonia, urea-N, and 3-methylhistdine. After completion of the SET and sampling period, horses entered a 1-wk recovery period, which was followed by another SET. The protocol repeated until horses rotated through all feeding protocols in the study (three SETs). The majority of the plasma AA were elevated in PRE horses compared with POST horses prior to the SET until 2 h postexercise where POST horses\u2019 plasma AA concentrations became elevated and remained elevated until the end of the sampling period. In that same time frame, plasma AA for the PRE group decreased out to the end of the sampling period. The elevation of plasma AA in POST horses would be expected as they were fed at 1 h postexercise, whereas PRE horses were reaching a 4 h postfeeding time frame at this point. This elevation was not observed for plasma concentrations of isoleucine, leucine, methionine, and histidine. Concentrations of these AA initially were greater for POST horses in the postexercise period; however, they declined more rapidly than the other AA. The rapid decrease of some of the plasma AA concentrations may suggest uptake by muscle for recovery. This in conjunction with a decrease in plasma creatine kinase concentrations for POST horses suggests that feeding postexercise may facilitate better muscle protein balance (synthesis vs. breakdown) in the recovery period following exercise.",

One hundred thirty preterm infants who had undergone VFSS were enrolled in this retrospective study. The FSSPI was developed by referring to the Baby Regulated Organization of Subsystems and Sucking approach. The FSSPI score for each VFSS video was evaluated by a physiatrist as well as by three experienced speech-language pathologists. To verify the reliability of the FSSPI, the inter-evaluator and intra-evaluator associations for the FSSPI scores were analyzed. To verify the validity of the FSSPI, the association between FSSPI scores and clinical characteristics including prognosis-related factors was analyzed. The mean gestational age was 27.3\u00b12.8 weeks. The FSSPI showed a high degree of both intra-rater reliability and inter-rater reliability. Also, there was a significant negative correlation between the FSSPI score and corrected age (CA) at the time of performing VFSS. Further, a significant positive correlation was observed between the FSSPI score and CA at the time of achieving full oral feeding. A significant negative correlation was observed between the FSSPI score and weight gain, between the 1st and 2nd month after birth, and between the 2nd and 3rd month after birth, respectively. In this study, we proposed a new clinical scale using VFSS to reflect the development of feeding and swallowing skills in preterm infants.

    "abstract": "Despite its therapeutic advantages, chemotherapy can also cause adverse effects, including anorexia and loss of appetite. Although numerous patients with cancer have been reported to suffer from anorexia during or following chemotherapy, treatment options for anorexia remain to be determined. In Asian countries, traditional medicines are widely used to treat problems with appetite; sip-jeon-dea-bo-tang (SJDBT) is one of those medicines used for the treatment of anorexia. The present study demonstrated that SJDBT ameliorated cisplatin-induced anorexia. In a mouse model of chemotherapy-induced anorexia, oral administration of SJDBT prevented the cisplatin-induced reduction of food intake, inhibiting weight loss. The results of multiplex assays showed that SJDBT only altered the levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and leptin in the serum and fat tissue. In addition, SJDBT maintained the serum leptin level and increased the serum IL-6 level, whereas cisplatin reduced the levels of both serum leptin and IL-6. Furthermore, SJDBT was revealed to increase the levels of leptin and IL-6 in the fat tissue by activating the JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway. In conclusion, the present results revealed that SJDBT ameliorated cisplatin-induced anorexia, suggesting its usefulness in the prevention of anorexia during chemotherapy.",

    "abstract": "In 2018, the transition to routine vitamin A supplementation (VAS) was integrated with caregivers' preparation of nutritious complementary food from local produce and confidential counseling and provision of modern contraceptives. In 2019, funding for complementary food ceased and Community Health Workers (CHWs) were trained to track defaulters, while national efforts to improve Health Management Information Systems, supply chains and reduce teenage pregnancies were intensified. We report on key indicators after these changes and in comparison, to those previously published. The same Lot Quality Assurance Sampling methodology was used in both assessments: 19 villages were randomly selected in each of five lots in each of three districts then caregivers of children 6\u201059\u2009months age randomly selected and interviewed. Coverage of VAS, Albendazole, and Pentavalent 3 before and after these changes was over 80%, 75%, and 80% respectively, equitable by sex, age, caregiver's religion, and educational status. Comparison with 2018 found more lots failed to reach 80% VAS by verbal affirmation (10 vs 2), and coverage in one district (Bo) had dropped (77.5% vs 92.3%). Fewer caregivers were aware that VAS should be taken every 6\u00a0months (27% vs 50%), that complementary feeding should start at 6 months (63% vs 77%) or were providing minimal dietary diversity (27% vs 45%). There was an increase in caregivers using modern contraception (45% vs 35%), obtaining information about contraception from a friend (14% vs 9%), while fewer thought country rope/herbs (traditional contraceptives) were \u201ceffective\u201d (11% vs 21%) and stockouts of contraceptives at health facilities had dropped (24% vs 55%). Stipends for CHWs cost approximately $750\u2009K vs complementary food: $112\u2009K. Overall coverage for VAS, Albendazole, and Pentavalent remained effective but VAS had dropped significantly in one district. Complementary feeding practices had declined. Awareness, uptake, and contraceptives supply chains had improved.",

    "abstract": "Today, it is considered that infants can feel pain, and it can have several adverse effects on their development. Although different interventions, such as skin-to-skin contact (kangaroo mother care method), glucose solutions, breastfeeding, and local anesthetic agents, have been evaluated to reduce infants\u2019 pain, there is no clinical trial available to identify the best method. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of four methods of relieving infants\u2019 pain, i.e., breastfeeding, oral 25% dextrose, kangaroo mother care method (KMCM), and EMLA cream based on a pain score level following heal-prick sampling in term newborns. In this double-blind, controlled, randomized clinical trial, full term, and healthy infants in Shahid Motahhari Hospital, Marvdasht, Shiraz Province, Iran were studied. Infants were randomly allocated to four groups of interventions, i.e., A: breast milk feeding (n=42), B: oral 25% dextrose (n=40), C: KMCM (n=38), and D: KMCM ointment (n=40). All interventions were applied 15 minutes before heel-prick sampling. To evaluate the pain level in infants, the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) questionnaire was used. The data were analyzed with SPSS version 16 by ANOVA and the chi-squared tests. One hundred and sixty-one infants (93 males, 68 females) with an age range of 3 to 5 days were studied. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of gender (p=0.113), weight (p=0.059), and baseline pain score level (p=0.904). The breastfeeding method showed the lowest pain score in comparison to the other interventions (A=5.52\u00b12.22, B=6.45\u00b11.88, C=6.84\u00b11.96, D=7.37\u00b11.95; p=0.001) after the heel-prick sampling. It seems that, among the four methods of interventions in this study, the most effective method of lowering perceived pain in infants undergoing painful procedures was proven to be breastfeeding. This study is registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials with the registration number of IRCT20151201253256N1. This research was supported financially by the Research Council of the International Campus of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.",

Subjects were weight class athletes from colleges in Gyeong-gi Province. Subjects (n = 182) responded to a questionnaire assessing study variables by self-report, and data on 151 athletes were used for statistical analysis. Subjects were categorized into High vs. Normal Weight Loss (HWL, NWL) groups depending on weight control level. Data were analyzed using t-test, ANCOVA, \u03c7 2 -test, and multiple logistic regressions. Seventy-three percent of subjects were in the HWL group. The two groups showed significant differences in weight control practices such as frequency ( P < 0.01), duration and magnitude of weight loss, methods, and satisfaction with weight control ( P < 0.001). Multiple logistic regression showed that self-efficacy (OR: 0.846, 95% CI: 0.730, 0.980), eating behaviors during training period (OR: 1.285, 95% CI: 1.112, 1.485), and eating behaviors during the weight control period (OR: 0.731, 95% CI: 0.620, 0.863) were associated with weight control level. Compared to NWL athletes, HWL athletes agreed more strongly on the disadvantages of rapid weight loss ( P < 0.05 \u2013 P < 0.01), perceived less confidence in controlling overeating after matches ( P < 0.001), and making weight within their weight class ( P < 0.05). HWL athletes showed more inappropriate eating behaviors than NWL athletes, especially during the weight control period ( P < 0.05 \u2013 P < 0.001). Self-efficacy was lower and eating behaviors during pre-competition period were more inadequate in HWL athletes. Education programs should include strategies to help athletes apply appropriate methods for weight control, increase self-efficacy, and adopt desirable eating behaviors.",

The protective effects of D-methionine on cisplatin-induced anorexia and renal injury were investigated. The model of chronic cisplatin administration (5 mg/kg body weight) involved intraperitoneal injection on days 1, 8, and 15 and oral D-methionine (300 mg/kg body weight) coadministration daily for 20 days. On the 21st day of treatment, food intake and body weight in the cisplatin-treated group significantly decreased by 52% and 31%, respectively, when compared with a control group. D-methionine coadministration with cisplatin decreased food intake and body weight by 29% and 8%, respectively. In cisplatin-treated rats, white blood cell, mean corpuscular volume, and platelet values significantly decreased, while mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration significantly increased by 8.6% when compared with control rats. Cisplatin administration resulted in significantly decreased feeding efficiency, elevated renal oxidative stress, and reduced antioxidative activity. Leukocyte infiltration, tubule vacuolization, tubular expansion, and swelling were observed in the kidneys of cisplatin-treated rats. Oral D-methionine exhibited an antianorexic effect, with improvement in food intake, feeding efficiency, and hematological toxicities, as well as a protective effect against nephrotoxicity by elevated antioxidative activity. D-methionine may serve as a chemoprotectant in patients receiving cisplatin as part of a chemotherapy regimen.",

To understand the characteristics that are associated with the timing of infants\u2019 initial exposure to solid foods. The 2000 National Survey of Early Childhood Health (NSECH) was a nationally representative telephone survey of 2,068 parents of children aged 4\u201335\u00a0months, which profiled content and quality of health care for young children. African-American and Latino families were over-sampled. Analyses in this report include bivariate tests and logistic regressions.\u00a062% of parents reported introducing solids to their child between 4\u20136\u00a0months of age. African-American mothers (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.5 [0.3, 0.9]), English-speaking Latino mothers (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.4 [0.2, 0.7]), White mothers with more than high school education (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.5 [0.2, 1.0]), and mothers who breastfed for 4\u00a0months or longer (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.4 [0.3, 0.7]) were less likely to introduce solids early. Most parents (92%) of children 4\u20139\u00a0months of age reported that their pediatric provider had discussed introduction of solids with them since the child\u2019s birth, and provider discussion of feeding was not associated with the timing of introduction of solids. Although most parents recall discussing the introduction of solid foods with their child\u2019s physician, several subgroups of mothers introduce solid foods earlier than the AAP recommendation of 4\u20136\u00a0months. More effective discussion of solid food introduction linked to counseling and support of breastfeeding by the primary health care provider may reduce early introduction of solids.",

Our aim was to investigate the associations between impulsivity, inhibitory control, energy-dense food consumption, and body mass index (BMI) in women with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). In this cross-sectional study, 51 adult females with GAD answered the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) and participated in a go/no-go task using food images. Anthropometric measurements were evaluated. A food frequency questionnaire and a snack test were used to study eating behavior. Pearson correlation and multiple linear regression were performed to analyze the variables of interest, adjusted by age. Impulsivity predicted intake of sugar (p = 0.016, 95%CI 0.67-6.05), total fat (p = 0.007, 95%CI 0.62-3.71), and saturated fat (p = 0.004, 95%CI 0.30-1.48). The snack test showed a positive correlation between presence of impulsivity and intake of biscuits (R = 0.296; p = 0.051). Response inhibition to food images in the go/no-go task paradigm did not predict BMI or food intake. Impulsivity was predictive of higher sugar and saturated fat intake in women diagnosed with GAD. Our findings add to the literature regarding the association between neuropsychological factors and food consumption in this specific population.",

The present study was aimed at evaluating the utility of endometrial aspiration in various gynecological disorders. In this diagnostic accuracy study, 55 prospectively registered women with various gynecological disorders were evaluated clinically and subjected to endometrial aspiration cytology and study of endometrial histology. Endometrial aspiration was performed by infant feeding tube in 10 cases and intra cath cannula in 45 cases. The slides were stained with rapid Papanicolaou (PAP) stain and Leishman stain. Endometrial aspiration cytology showed 90% and 94.6% sampling adequacy with infant feeding tube and intra cath cannula, respectively. Intra cath cannula was very convenient to handle and superior to infant feeding tube in aspirating the endometrium. Of the two stains used, rapid PAP stain was less time-consuming and superior to Leishman stain in studying the nuclear details. Leishman stain was helpful in detecting cytoplasmic vacuoles of secretory endometrium. Overall diagnostic accuracy of endometrial cytology was 90.4% while that for morphological hormonal evaluation was 97.6%. It enjoyed a sensitivity of 91.66%, a specificity of 88.23%, positive predictive value of 94.28%, and negative predictive value of 83.33%. Intra cath cannula emerged as an inexpensive, effective, and convenient device for endometrial aspiration.

On arrival at the emergency room, extreme abdominal distension was detected and the patient's legs changed color. Computed tomography suggested severe gastric dilatation, so abdominal compartment syndrome was suspected and an emergent laparotomy was supposed to be conducted. Though anesthesia was induced without event, abrupt hemodynamic collapse developed just after the operation started. In spite of active resuscitation for 29 min, the patient did not recover and expired. As the incidence of eating disorders is increasing, anesthesiologists should keep in mind the possibility of abdominal compartment syndrome in patients with a recent history of binge eating, and prepare optimal anesthetic and resuscitation remedies against sudden deteriorations of a patient's condition.",

However, sweating can be problematic for individuals with spinal cord injuries (SCI), as they display a blunting of sudomotor and vasomotor responses below the level of the injury. Sweat gland density and eccrine gland metabolism in SCI are not well understood. Consequently, this study examined sweat lactate (S-LA) (reflective of sweat gland metabolism), active sweat gland density (SGD), and sweat output per gland (S/G) in 7 SCI athletes and 8 able-bodied (AB) controls matched for arm ergometry VO 2 peak. A sweat collection device was positioned on the upper scapular and medial calf of each subject just prior to the beginning of the trial, with iodine sweat gland density patches positioned on the upper scapular and medial calf. Participants were tested on a ramp protocol (7 min per stage, 20 W increase per stage) in a common exercise environment (21\u00b11\u00b0C, 45-65% relative humidity). An independent t-test revealed lower (p<0.05) SGD (upper scapular) for SCI (22.3 \u00b114.8 glands \u00b7 cm \u22122 ) vs. AB. (41.0 \u00b1 8.1 glands \u00b7 cm \u22122 ).

S-LA was significantly greater (p<0.05) during the second exercise stage for SCI (11.5\u00b110.9 mmol \u00b7 l \u22121 ) vs. AB (26.8\u00b111.07 mmol \u00b7 l \u22121 ). These findings suggest that SCI athletes had less active sweat glands compared to the AB group, but the sweat response was similar (SLA, S/G) between AB and SCI athletes.

    "abstract": "Caenorhabditis  elegans has emerged as a powerful model to study the genetics of feeding, food-related behaviors, and metabolism. Despite the many advantages of C. elegans as a model organism, direct measurement of its bacterial food intake remains challenging. Here, we describe two complementary methods that measure the food intake of C. elegans . The first method is a microtiter plate-based bacterial clearing assay that measures food intake by quantifying the change in the optical density of bacteria over time. The second method, termed pulse feeding, measures the absorption of food by tracking de novo protein synthesis using a novel metabolic pulse-labeling strategy. Using the bacterial clearance assay, we compare the bacterial food intake of various C. elegans strains and show that long-lived eat mutants eat substantially more than previous estimates. To demonstrate the applicability of the pulse-feeding assay, we compare the assimilation of food for two C. elegans strains in response to serotonin. We show that serotonin-increased feeding leads to increased protein synthesis in a SER-7 -dependent manner, including proteins known to promote aging. Protein content in the food has recently emerged as critical factor in determining how food composition affects aging and health. The pulse-feeding assay, by measuring de novo protein synthesis, represents an ideal method to unequivocally establish how the composition of food dictates protein synthesis. In combination, these two assays provide new and powerful tools for C. elegans research to investigate feeding and how food intake affects the proteome and thus the physiology and health of an organism.",

Radiation exposure to both mother and infant and the radiolucent properties of breastmilk make videofluoroscopy an unsuitable imaging modality. Furthermore, ultrasound is not ideal for capturing the complex 3\u2010dimensional functional anatomy of swallowing. In this study we explore the feasibility of using real\u2010time MRI to capture the breastfeeding swallow. Prospective observational study: Review of imaging from 12 normal infants (<5\u2009months of age) and their mothers while breastfeeding using real\u2010time MRI. Static images were successfully captured in 11 infants and dynamic images in nine infants. This imaging modality confirms the dorsal surface of the infant's tongue elevates the maternal nipple to the hard palate, closing the space around the nipple with no air visible in the oral cavity during sucking and swallowing. We obtained dynamic imaging of mandibular movement with sucking, palatal elevation and pharyngeal constriction with swallowing, diaphragm movement with breathing and milk entering the stomach. Breastmilk was easily visualized, being high intensity on T2 sequences. Technical challenges were encountered secondary to infant movement and difficulties acquiring and maintaining midsagittal orientation. The similarity in tissue densities of the lips, tongue, nipple and hard palate limited definition between these structures. Real\u2010time MRI imaging was successful in capturing dynamic images of the breastfeeding swallow. However, technical and practical challenges make real\u2010time MRI unlikely at present to be suitable for swallow assessment in clinical practice. Advances in technology and expertise in dynamic image capture may improve the feasibility of using MRI to understand and assess the breastfeeding swallow in the near future.  4.  The breastfeeding swallow is difficult to image and poorly understood. Dynamic MRI imaging has been used to visualize mothers and their infants while breastfeeding, demonstrating the dynamic events occurring during sucking and swallowing. ",

    "abstract": "Excessive sweating is a medical condition in which a person sweats much more than needed. The medical name of this disorder is hyperhidrosis known as a common dermal problem that affects people of all ages and leads to negative impact on the quality of life. During the last decades, several studies have shown that in many cases of hyperhidrosis there is no evidence of systemic disease. Therefore, most treatments are temporary and symptomatic therapy. According to Iranian traditional medicine (ITM), different approaches are mentioned for hyperhidrosis. This study has reviewed ITM textbooks, such as \u201cCanon of Medicine and Exir-e-azam\u201d as well as scientific references and databases of modern medicine (ISI, PubMed, etc.) with specific keywords. Contents and related concepts were classified and results prepared. In modern medicine, hyperhidrosis has been defined as an abnormal excessive sweating, which is either primary (idiopathic) or secondary to other systemic diseases such as hyperthyroidism, neurological condition or heart disease. Current modalities for treatment are topical anti-perspiration, iontophoresis, Botox injection (Botulinum toxin type A) and eventually thoracic sympathectomy as the last therapeutic modalities. From the viewpoint of the Iranian traditional medicine as a holistic doctrine, hyperhidrosis etiologies include overfilled and repletion of body due to the accumulation of humors, excessive intake of food, excessive dilated skin pores, vigorous exercise, or physical activity. Therefore, therapeutic plan for hyperhidrosis was based on its cause, which includes reduction in the amount of food, increasing physical activity, purging the body from the excess humors and adjustment in temperament. Hyperhidrosis is not an important or dangerous disorder; however, due to the negative impact on quality of life and failure to achieve perfect answer in modern medicine treatments it seems that the recommendations of Iranian traditional medicine will be helpful to control this disorder.",

Specific schema-based strategies focused on bodily felt-sense and body-image, as well as emotional regulation skills. Six attended until end of treatment, two dropped-out at mid-treatment. Eating disorder severity, global schema severity, shame, and anxiety levels were reduced between pre- and post-therapy, with a large effect size at follow-up. Clinically significant improvement in eating severity was found in four out of six completers. Group completers showed a mean reduction in schema severity of 43% at post-treatment, and 59% at follow-up. By follow-up, all completers had achieved over 60% improvement in schema severity. Self-report feedback suggests that group factors may catalyze the change process in schema therapy by increasing perceptions of support and encouragement to take risks and try out new behaviors, whilst providing a de-stigmatizing and de-shaming therapeutic experience.",

However, until recently, little was known about the influencing factors of these brain volume alterations, nor their exact quantification and rehabilitation. This review addresses these open questions and further explores what is now known about the underlying patho-biology and the clinical consequences including human studies as well as animal studies mimicking anorexia nervosa in ro-dents. GM was reduced by 3.7% in adults and 7.6% in adolescents with AN. WM was reduced on average 2.2% in adult patients and 3.2% in adolescents. Most volume deficits in adults are reversible after long-term recovery; for adolescents, data are less clear. The main influencing factors for GM were absolute lowest weight at admission and illness duration. Cerebellar and WM reductions at admission predicted clinical outcome at one year follow-up. New studies found GABA receptor changes in GM and astrocyte loss in both GM and WM, as well as a possible role for oestrogen deficit. All three could part-ly explain clinical symptoms of anxiety, rigidity and learning impairments in patients with AN. Brain volume deficits in AN seem to play a causal role in the course and the prognosis of AN. A better under-standing of these brain changes could lead to more targeted therapies for patients with AN, including astrocyte-directed ap-proaches",

    "abstract": "The prevalence of atopic dermatitis in infants is increasing worldwide. However, the nutrient intake status of infants with atopic dermatitis has not been studied properly. This study was conducted to compare the nutrient intake status of infants in the weaning period with atopic dermatitis by feeding type. Feeding types, nutrient intake status and growth status of 98 infants with atopic dermatitis from age 6 to 12 months were investigated. Feeding types were surveyed using questionnaires, and daily intakes were recorded by mothers using the 24-hour recall method. Growth and iron status were also measured. The result showed that breastfed infants consumed less energy and 13 nutrients compared to formula-fed or mixed-fed infants ( p < 0.001). The breastfed group showed a significantly lower intake rate to the Dietary Reference Intakes for Koreans than the other two groups ( p < 0.001). In addition, they consumed less than 75% of the recommended intakes in all nutrients, except for protein and vitamin A, and in particular, iron intake was very low, showing just 18.7% of the recommended intake. There was no significant difference in growth by feeding type, but breastfed infants showed a significantly higher rate of iron deficiency anemia ( p < 0.001). Continuous management programs should be prepared for breastfed infants with atopic dermatitis, who are in a period when rapid growth takes place and proper nutrient intake is essential.",

    "abstract": "Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the unexpected death of an infant that remains unexplained after a thorough investigation of the circumstances, family history, paediatric investigation and complete autopsy. In Western society, it is the leading cause of post-neonatal death below 1\u00a0year of age. In the Netherlands, the SIDS incidence is very low, which offers opportunities to assess the importance of old and new environmental risk factors. For this purpose, cases were collected through pathology departments and the working group on SIDS of the Dutch Paediatrician Foundation. A total of 142 cases were included; these occurred after the parental education on sleeping position (1987), restricted to the international age criteria and had no histological explanation. Age-matched healthy controls ( N =\u20092,841) came from a survey of the Netherlands Paediatric Surveillance Unit, completed between November 2002 and April 2003. A multivariate analysis was performed to determine the risk factors for SIDS, including sleeping position, antenatal maternal smoking, postnatal parental smoking, premature birth, gender, lack of breastfeeding and socio-economic status. Postnatal smoking was identified as an important environmental risk factor for SIDS (OR one parent\u2009=\u20092.5 [1.2, 5.0]; both parents\u2009=\u20095.77 [2.2, 15.5]; maternal\u2009=\u20092.7 [1.0, 6.4]; paternal\u2009=\u20092.4 [1.3, 4.5] ) as was prone sleeping (OR put prone to sleep\u2009=\u200921.5 [10.6, 43.5]; turned prone during sleep\u2009=\u2009100 [46, 219]). Premature birth was also significantly associated with SIDS (OR\u2009=\u20092.4 [1.2, 4.8]). Postnatal parental smoking is currently a major environmental risk factor for SIDS in the Netherlands together with the long-established risk of prone sleeping.",

    "abstract": "A high percentage of individuals affected by eating disorders (ED) achieve incomplete recovery following treatment. In an attempt to improve treatment outcome, it is crucial that predictors of outcome are identified, and personalized care approaches established in line with new treatment targets, thus facilitating patient access to evidence-based treatments. Among the psychological factors proposed as predictors of outcome in ED, alexithymia is of outstanding interest. The objective of this paper is to undertake a systematic review of the literature relating to alexithymia, specifically in terms of the implications for treatment of ED. In particular, issues concerning the role of alexithymia as a predictor of outcome and as a factor to be taken into account in the choice of treatment will be addressed. The effect of treatments on alexithymia will also be considered. A search of all relevant literature published in English using PubMed, PsycINFO, and Scopus databases was carried out on the basis of the following keywords: alexithymia, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, eating disorders, and treatment; no time limits were imposed. Despite the clinical relevance of alexithymia, the number of studies published on the above cited aspects is somewhat limited, and these studies are largely heterogeneous and feature significant methodological weaknesses. Overall, data currently available mostly correlate higher levels of alexithymia with a less favorable outcome in ED. Accordingly, alexithymia is seen as a relevant treatment target with the aim of achieving recovery of these patients. Treatments focusing on improving alexithymic traits, and specifically those targeting emotions, seem to show greater efficacy, although alexithymia levels often remain high even after specific treatment. Further investigations are needed to overcome the methodological limitations of previous studies, to understand the actual impact of alexithymia on ED outcome, and to allow more precise implications for treatment to be drawn. Additional research should also be undertaken to specify which of the alexithymic dimensions are specifically relevant to the course and outcome of ED, and to identify treatment protocols producing a significantly greater efficacy in ED patients with relevant alexithymic traits.",

    "abstract": "The current literature regarding the transition from milks to solid foods across the first 2\u00a0years of life is limited despite the important influence of early dietary intake on children's growth and development. The present study describes dietary intake from birth to 2\u00a0years across four developmental relevant time\u2010points within an Australian birth cohort. Dietary data from 466 infants was collected at four time\u2010points in the first 2\u00a0years of life via parent\u2010reported questionnaire, including a 45\u2010item food and beverage frequency questionnaire. Subsample analyses of children who were aged 1\u20133, 6\u20138, 12\u201314 and 18\u201320\u00a0months at the time of data collection were conducted. Infant formula remained consistently consumed by over 75% of children from the 6\u20138\u2010 to 18\u201320\u00a0months old age groups. Mean (SD) age of\u00a0introduction to solid foods was 5.2 (1.3) months. Almost 20% and 10% of children were introduced before 16 and after 32\u00a0weeks, respectively. The highest consumption of core foods, recommended for a healthy diet, daily was seen in the 12\u201314\u00a0months old age group with lower proportions in the 18\u201320\u00a0months old age group coinciding with an increased proportion of children eating discretionary choice foods, not recommended for a healthy diet. Discretionary choice foods/beverages presented in children's diets as early as in the 6\u20138\u00a0months old age group. By 18\u201320\u00a0months, at least 20% of children were consuming savoury biscuits, sweet biscuits, muesli bars and luncheon meats at least twice a week. The present study identified a number of findings outside the recommendations of the Australian Dietary and Infant Feeding Guidelines. Further work is warranted to explore these outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Culicidae colonization in laboratory is paramount to conduct studies aiming at a better understanding of mosquitoes' capacity to transmit pathogens that cause deadly diseases. Colonization requires female blood feeding, a necessary step for maturation of female's oocytes. Direct blood feeding on anesthetized mammals implies in a number of disadvantages when compared to artificial blood feeding. Consequently, laboratories worldwide have been trying to -feed female mosquitoes artificially in order to replace direct feeding. In this study, we compared the effects of direct blood feeding and artificial blood feeding on important life traits of three Culicidae species. Artificial feeding was performed using citrated or defibrinated sheep blood and citrated or defibrinated rabbit blood. Direct feeding was performed using anesthetized guinea pigs as the blood source and the experiment control. Results indicated that artificial feeding using sheep blood was not good enough to justify its use in the maintenance of laboratory colonies of Culicidae. However, artificial feeding using rabbit blood maintained a recovery rate always very close to the control, especially when blood was citrated. We concluded that artificial feeding using citrated rabbit blood can substitute direct feeding on mammals reducing the use of animals, eliminating the need to maintain a bioterium in the laboratory and reducing costs in scientific researches involving Culicidae vectors.",

Methods: DEB was investigated using Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) test by a psychologist. Questions regarding insulin dosage manipulation or omission to obtain decrease in weight were added. Specific behavioral items from the EDE were used to define DEB: Objective Binge-eating, Self-induced Vomiting for weight control; the use of Diuretics, Laxatives or Insulin Omission for weight loss. Some EDE items provided information about four composite subscales which assesse Restraint, Eating concern, Shape concern and Weight concern. Results: Shape and Weight concern showed significantly higher scores than those observed in the other two subscales (p=0.021). Average scores of each subscale resulted significantly higher in girls than in boys as well as in teen than in pre-teen participants. Objective binge eating (20%) and insulin dosage omission or reduction (17.6%) were the most common DEB (p<0.03). Forty-one percent of participants reported to consume three, 25% four and 34% five meals daily. A significantly lower proportion of females than males resulted to consume breakfast and mid-afternoon snacks. Conclusions : Findings from this study suggest that caregivers working in pediatric diabetes units should be alert in order to discover some DEB such as medication omission and binge-eating, all indicative symptoms of dissatisfaction of the body and psychological distress in diabetes management.

    "abstract": "Symptoms of depression and eating disorders increase during adolescence, particularly among girls, and they tend to co-occur. Despite this evidence, there is meager research on whether depression increases the risk of future eating pathology, or vice versa, and we do not know whether these processes are different for adolescent girls and boys. Accordingly, this study explored the prospective reciprocal associations between depressive symptoms and disordered eating at different time points from preadolescence to mid-adolescence and tested the moderator effect of gender on these associations. A community-based sample of Spanish youth ( N =\u2009942, 49\u00a0% female) was assessed at ages of approximately 10-11 (T1), 12-13 (T2), 14-15 (T3), and 16-17 (T4) years. The bidirectional relationships between depressive symptoms and disordered eating were estimated in an autoregressive cross-lagged model with latent variables. A unidirectional, age-specific association between depressive symptoms at T1 and disordered eating at T2 was found. No other significant cross-lagged effect emerged, but the stability of the constructs was considerable. Gender did not moderate any of the links examined. Regardless of gender, the transition from childhood to adolescence appears to be a key period when depressive symptoms foster the development of disordered eating. These findings suggest that early prevention and treatment of depression targeting both girls and boys may result in lower levels of depressive symptoms and disordered eating in adolescence.",

    "abstract": "Overweight and obesity during pregnancy are associated with adverse health outcomes leading to increased maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Women with a high body mass index (BMI) also experience low breastfeeding rates. There is limited evidence of effective educational programs that aim to improve length of breastfeeding among this population. The main objective of this pilot educational intervention was to determine knowledge and skills retention at six weeks after completion of a breastfeeding class. A two-hour breastfeeding class was offered during the second and third trimester of pregnancy targeting high BMI women. A longitudinal, survey study design was conducted using two data collection points. No comparator group was employed. Baseline mean age of respondents was 26.6 years (SD = 5.7). Respondents who completed post-intervention surveys were largely white (69.2%) followed by Hispanic (15.4%) and non-Hispanic black (15.4%), some college (57.1%), earned less than $50,000/year (64.3%), had employer-provided insurance (53.8%), and did not receive WIC benefits (78.6%). Most respondents had a pre-pregnancy BMI category of overweight (28.6%) or obese (57.1%). The intervention appeared to have some impact on responses. The following were observed: an increased understanding that baby may be fussy in the evening hours and wants to nurse more often (p < 0.002), how to bring baby to the breast (p = 0.004), knowing what to do if breastfeeding hurts (p = 0.031), and knowing what to do when baby has trouble breastfeeding (p = 0.021). Consistent with previous findings, all participants in our study reported increased knowledge to breastfeed. Thus, women\u2019s confidence to breastfeed their infant is enhanced through knowledge obtained from breastfeeding education. Additional studies are underway to assess breastfeeding behaviors.",

    "abstract": "The present study aimed to develop a symptom-based (namely, hot flashes and sweating) scoring system for predicting the risk of depressive symptoms in menopausal women via a multicentre cross-sectional survey. The data examined in the present study were obtained from 1,004 women aged 40\u201360 years who underwent physical examination at A Hospital. The basic information was obtained using a questionnaire-based survey. A self-rating depression scale was used to obtain the depressive symptom scores, while the Kupperman Menopausal Index was used to obtain the scores for the frequency of hot flashes and sweating. A logistic regression model was also established. The resulting \u03b2 coefficient was employed to calculate and predict the risk of depressive symptoms in these women and a risk scoring system was established. The scoring system was validated using samples from 2 other centers (validation sample 1: B Hospital, 440 women; validation sample 2: C Hospital, 247 women). The scoring system developed to predict the risk of depressive symptoms in menopausal women was based on hot flash and sweating symptoms and associated with menopausal status, hot flash scores, education level (high school education and below) and being diabetic. The scoring system yielded a total score of 0\u201354 points. For women in the study sample, the area under the curve (AUC) of depressive symptom risk score was 0.750 (95% CI, 0.708\u20130.793). Validation sample 1 had an AUC of 0.731 (95% CI, 0.667\u20130.794), while validation sample 2 had an AUC of 0.744 (95% CI, 0.669\u20130.820). The optimal cut-off score to assess depressive symptoms in women participating in the present study was 31 points. The sensitivity and specificity for predicting depressive symptoms in the study sample were 0.667 and 0.701, respectively. In contrast, the sensitivity was 0.840 in validation sample 1 and 0.879 in validation sample 2. The hot flash and sweating symptom-based scoring system developed to predict the risk of depressive symptoms in menopausal women relies on non-laboratory survey data. The system is simple, practical, and convenient to use. For Chinese huge population of menopausal women, the scoring system should be considered a reliable screening tool for depressive symptoms.",

Because pregnant and reproductive-aged women account for a large proportion of the population with particular concerns regarding vaccination against COVID-19, this survey aimed at investigating their current attitudes and beliefs within our own institution. This study aimed to understand vaccine acceptability among pregnant, nonpregnant, and breastfeeding respondents and elucidate factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. We administered an anonymous online survey to all women (including patients, providers, and staff) at our institution assessing rates of acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination. Respondents were contacted in 1 of 3 ways: by email, advertisement flyers, and distribution of quick response codes at virtual town halls regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. Based on their responses, respondents were divided into 3 mutually exclusive groups: (1) nonpregnant respondents, (2) pregnant respondents, and (3) breastfeeding respondents. The primary outcome was acceptance of vaccination. Prevalence ratios were calculated to ascertain the independent effects of multiple patient-level factors on vaccine acceptability. The survey was administered from January 7, 2021, to January 29, 2021, with 1012 respondents of whom 466 (46.9%) identified as non-Hispanic White, 108 (10.9%) as non-Hispanic Black, 286 (28.8%) as Hispanic, and 82 (8.2%) as non-Hispanic Asian. The median age was 36 years (interquartile range, 25\u201347 years). Of all the respondents, 656 respondents (64.8%) were nonpregnant, 216 (21.3%) were pregnant, and 122 (12.1%) were breastfeeding. There was no difference in chronic comorbidities when evaluated as a composite variable (Table 1). A total of 390 respondents (39.2%) reported working in healthcare. Nonpregnant respondents were most likely to accept vaccination (457 respondents, 76.2%; P <.001) with breastfeeding respondents the second most likely (55.2%). Pregnant respondents had the lowest rate of vaccine acceptance (44.3%; P <.001). Prevalence ratios revealed all non-White races except for non-Hispanic Asian respondents, and Spanish-speaking respondents were less likely to accept vaccination (Table 3). Working in healthcare was not found to be associated with vaccine acceptance among our cohort. In this survey study of only women at a single institution, pregnant respondents of non-White or non-Asian races were more likely to decline vaccination than nonpregnant and breastfeeding respondents. Working in healthcare was not associated with vaccine acceptance.",

    "abstract": "The circadian clock in peripheral tissues can be entrained by restricted feeding (RF), a regimen that restricts the duration of food availability with no calorie restriction (CR). However, it is not known whether RF can delay the occurrence of age-associated changes similar to CR. We measured circadian expression of clock genes, disease marker genes, metabolic factors and inflammatory and allergy markers in mouse serum, liver, jejunum and white adipose tissue (WAT) after long-term RF of 4 months. We found that circadian rhythmicity is more robust and is phase advanced in most of the genes and proteins tested under RF. In addition, average daily levels of some disease and inflammatory markers were reduced under RF, including liver Il-6 mRNA, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) protein; jejunum Arginase, Afp, Gadd45\u03b2, Il-1 \u03b1 and Il-1 \u03b2 mRNA, and interleukin (IL)-6 and TNF-\u03b1 protein and WAT Il-6, Il-1\u03b2, Tnf \u03b1 and Nf \u03ba b mRNA. In contrast, the anti-inflammatory cytokine Il-10 mRNA increased in the liver and jejunum. Our results suggest that RF may share some benefits with those of CR. As RF is a less harsh regimen to follow than CR, the data suggest it could be proposed for individuals seeking to improve their health.",

    "abstract": "Individuals may reduce competition by temporally partitioning their use of a shared resource. Behavioral differences between sexes in ungulates may encourage segregation as individuals attempt to avoid antagonistic interactions. However, dominant sex and age groups may reduce subordinates\u2019 access to food resources, regardless of the subordinate\u2019s sex. We hypothesized that white-tailed deer Odocoileus virginianus temporally segregated at supplemental feeding sites based on social rank (subordinate: yearling males and adult females; dominant: adult males) and that segregation was affected by phase of the breeding season and diel cycle. If deer temporally segregate according to social rank, we predicted that the resulting activity patterns would manifest in one social class being relatively more susceptible to hunter-induced mortality. We used a multi-state modeling approach to quantify temporal segregation and calculated the probability that a feeding site was in a particular state during diurnal and nocturnal hours for each of the 3 phases of the breeding season. We determined that transition probabilities differed by season and diel cycle and dominant and subordinate social classes clearly avoided each other, with <1% co-occurrence at feeding sites. During the pre-breeding season, the probability of a subordinate being present during diurnal hours was 3.0 \u00d7 more likely than a dominant being present, but did not differ during nocturnal hours. There was no difference for dominants and subordinates during diurnal or nocturnal hours during the breeding season. In the post-breeding season, subordinates were 1.7 \u00d7 more likely to occur at the feeding site than a dominant during diurnal hours but they did not differ during nocturnal hours. Our results indicate that dominance status influences temporal segregation at feeding sites and is affected by the phase of the breeding season. Therefore, the resulting activity patterns may increase subordinates\u2019 risk to human predation during the pre-breeding and post-breeding seasons.",

    "abstract": "Recent breastfeeding studies from immigration countries have found that acculturation factors influence breastfeeding behaviour in women with a migration background. To date, there has been no systematic investigation for Germany. Therefore, we study whether and how the degree of acculturation within a population of migrant women influences the start, time and duration of breastfeeding. Pregnant women who were admitted to one of the three participating maternity clinics in Berlin for the birth of their child in the one-year study period were surveyed (including sociodemographic details, data on migration/acculturation). These women were interviewed again two or three days post partum (including start of breastfeeding, planned breastfeeding duration, reasons for not breastfeeding). In a subgroup, a telephone interview took place 6 months post partum about the actual breastfeeding duration, contraceptive behaviour post partum and availing of midwife services following delivery. Breastfeeding behaviour was analysed using multivariate regression models, among other things. The prepartum survey included 7100 women, 6884 women were contacted in the postnatal wards, and the subgroup six months after delivery comprised 605 women. No acculturation-related differences were found in the start of breastfeeding. In the adjusted model, a medium and higher degree of acculturation diminished the chance of planning a long breastfeeding period. More acculturated women show a greater risk of weaning within the first six months than less acculturated women. The degree of acculturation has relevant significance for some aspects of breastfeeding behaviour in women with a migration background. This should be considered both in breastfeeding promotion programmes and in further national breastfeeding studies.  Fragestellungen Neuere Stillstudien aus Einwanderungsl\u00e4ndern fanden einen Einfluss von Akkulturationsfaktoren auf das Stillverhalten bei Frauen mit Migrationshintergrund (MH). Eine systematische Untersuchung f\u00fcr Deutschland fehlt bisher. Es soll daher untersucht werden, ob und wie der Akkulturationsgrad innerhalb eines Migrantinnenkollektivs Stillbeginn, -zeit und -dauer beeinflusst.  Patientinnenkollektiv und Methodik Es wurden schwangere Frauen befragt, die im 1-j\u00e4hrigen Untersuchungszeitraum in einer der 3 teilnehmenden Berliner Geburtskliniken zur Geburt ihres Kindes aufgenommen wurden (u.\u200aa. soziodemografische Angaben, Daten zu Migration/Akkulturation). Diese Frauen wurden nochmals 2 bzw. 3 Tage post partum interviewt (u.\u200aa. Stillbeginn, geplante Stilldauer, Gr\u00fcnde f\u00fcr Nichtstillen). Bei einem Teilkollektiv erfolgte 6 Monate post partum ein Telefoninterview zur tats\u00e4chlichen Stilldauer, zum Verh\u00fctungsverhalten post partum und zur Inanspruchnahme von Hebammenangeboten nach der Entbindung. Das Stillverhalten wurde u.\u200aa. anhand multivariater Regressionsmodelle analysiert.  Ergebnisse Das pr\u00e4partal befragte Kollektiv umfasste 7100 Frauen, auf den Wochenbettstationen konnten insgesamt 6884 Frauen erreicht werden, beim Teilkollektiv 6 Monate nach der Entbindung 605 Frauen. Es zeigten sich keine akkulturationsbedingten Unterschiede beim Stillbeginn. Im adjustierten Modell verringerten ein mittlerer und h\u00f6herer Akkulturationsgrad die Chance, eine lange Stillzeit zu planen. Mehr akkulturierte Frauen weisen ein gr\u00f6\u00dferes Risiko auf, innerhalb der ersten 6 Monate nach der Geburt abzustillen, als weniger akkulturierte.  Schlussfolgerung Der Akkulturationsgrad hat relevante Bedeutung f\u00fcr einige Aspekte des Stillverhaltens bei Frauen mit Migrationshintergrund. Dies sollte sowohl bei Stillf\u00f6rderprogrammen als auch bei weiteren nationalen Stillstudien beachtet werden.",

A total of 270 fish (each experiment) individual body weight (BW) averaging 16\u00b10.3 g (mean\u00b1SD) were fed a commercial diet for 4 wk at 16\u00b0C, 20\u00b0C, and 24\u00b0C. At each temperature, triplicate tanks were assigned to one of 6 feeding rates: 1.5%, 2.5%, 2.8%, 3.1%, 3.4%, and satiation (3.7% BW/d) at 16\u00b0C, 1.9%, 2.9%, 3.2%, 3.5%, 3.8% and satiation (4.1% BW/d) at 20\u00b0C and 1.7%, 2.7%, 3.0%, 3.3%, 3.6%, and satiation (3.9% BW/d) at 24\u00b0C water temperature. Weight gains of fish in satiation and 3.4% groups at 16\u00b0C, in satiation and 3.8% groups at 20\u00b0C and in satiation and 3.6% groups at 24\u00b0C were significantly higher than those of fish in the other treatments (p<0.05). A broken line regression analysis of weight gain indicated that optimum feeding rates of juvenile Korean rockfish were 3.41% at 16\u00b0C, 3.75% at 20\u00b0C and 3.34% at 24\u00b0C water temperature. Results of the present study indicate that the optimum feeding rate could be >3.1% but <3.41% at 16\u00b0C, >3.5% but <3.75% at 20\u00b0C and >3.0% but <3.34% at 24\u00b0C. As we expected results suggest that fish performed better at 20\u00b0C than 16\u00b0C or 24\u00b0C water temperature and the optimum feeding rate could be 3.1% BW/d to 3.7% BW/d in 16 g of juvenile Korean rockfish.",

    "abstract": "In 1968, the Harvard criteria equated irreversible coma and apnea (i.e., brain death) with human death and later, the Uniform Determination of Death Act was enacted permitting organ procurement from heart-beating donors. Since then, clinical studies have defined a spectrum of states of impaired consciousness in human beings: coma, akinetic mutism (locked-in syndrome), minimally conscious state, vegetative state and brain death. In this article, we argue against the validity of the Harvard criteria for equating brain death with human death. (1) Brain death does not disrupt somatic integrative unity and coordinated biological functioning of a living organism. (2) Neurological criteria of human death fail to determine the precise moment of an organism\u2019s death when death is established by circulatory criterion in other states of impaired consciousness for organ procurement with non-heart-beating donation protocols. The criterion of circulatory arrest 75\u00a0s to 5\u00a0min is too short for irreversible cessation of whole brain functions and respiration controlled by the brain stem. (3) Brain-based criteria for determining death with a beating heart exclude relevant anthropologic, psychosocial, cultural, and religious aspects of death and dying in society. (4) Clinical guidelines for determining brain death are not consistently validated by the presence of irreversible brain stem ischemic injury or necrosis on autopsy; therefore, they do not completely exclude reversible loss of integrated neurological functions in donors. The questionable reliability and varying compliance with these guidelines among institutions amplify the risk of determining reversible states of impaired consciousness as irreversible brain death. (5) The scientific uncertainty of defining and determining states of impaired consciousness including brain death have been neither disclosed to the general public nor broadly debated by the medical community or by legal and religious scholars. Heart-beating or non-heart-beating organ procurement from patients with impaired consciousness is de facto a concealed practice of physician-assisted death, and therefore, violates both criminal law and the central tenet of medicine not to do harm to patients. Society must decide if physician-assisted death is permissible and desirable to resolve the conflict about procuring organs from patients with impaired consciousness within the context of the perceived need to enhance the supply of transplantable organs.",

    "abstract": "Three important infant feeding support problems are addressed: (1) mothers who use formula milk can feel undersupported and judged; (2) mothers can feel underprepared for problems with breastfeeding; and (3) many mothers who might benefit from breastfeeding support do not access help. Theory of constraints (TOC) is used to examine these problems in relation to ante\u2010natal education and post\u2010natal support. TOC suggests that long\u2010standing unresolved problems or \u2018 undesirable effects \u2019 in any system (in this case a system to provide education and support) are caused by conflicts, or dilemmas , within the system, which might not be explicitly acknowledged. Potential solutions are missed by failure to question assumptions which, when interrogated, often turn out to be invalid. Three core dilemmas relating to the three problems are identified, articulated and explored using TOC methodology. These are whether to: (1) promote feeding choice or to promote breastfeeding; (2) present breastfeeding positively, as straightforward and rewarding, or focus on preparing mothers for problems; and (3) offer support proactively or ensure that mothers themselves initiate requests for support. Assumptions are identified and interrogated, leading to clarified priorities for action relating to each problem. These are (1) shift the focus from initial decision\u2010making towards support for mothers throughout their feeding journeys, enabling and protecting decisions to breastfeed as one aspect of ongoing support; (2) to promote the concept of an early\u2010weeks investment and adjustment period during which breastfeeding is established; and (3) to develop more proactive mother\u2010centred models of support for all forms of infant feeding.",

To quantify the impact of self-quarantine on bariatric patients and self-quarantine\u2019s relationship with weight gain. Academic hospital, United States. A 30-item survey examining several known contributors to weight regain was distributed among the postoperative bariatric patients of our clinic. Changes in eating habits, exercise, depression, social support, loneliness, and anxiety were studied, among others. A total of 208 patients completed the survey (29.3% response rate). A large percentage of patients reported increases in their depression (44.2%), loneliness (36.2%), nervousness (54.7%), snacking (62.6%), loss of control when eating (48.2%), and binge eating (19.5%) and decreases in their social support (23.2%), healthy food eating (45.5%), and activity (55.2%). Difficulty in accessing vitamins was reported by 13%. Patients more than 18 months out of surgery regained more than 2 kg during an average of 47 days. Risk factors for weight regain were found to be loss of control when eating, increases in snacking and binge eating, reduced consumption of healthy food, and reduced physical activity. Bariatric patients are negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent social isolation on many levels. This patient population is vulnerable to crisis situations; thus, additional intervention is needed to address behaviors that lead to weight regain.",

A 12-month, open-label extension study assessed the long-term safety and tolerability of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX) in adults with binge eating disorder (BED). Adults (aged 18\u201355 y) with BED who completed 1 of 3 antecedent studies were enrolled in a 52-week, open-label extension study (dose optimization, 4 weeks [initial titration dose, 30-mg LDX; target doses, 50- or 70-mg LDX]; dose maintenance, 48 weeks). Safety evaluations included the occurrence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), vital sign and weight assessments, and Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale responses. Of the 604 enrolled participants, 599 (521 women and 78 men) comprised the safety analysis set, and 369 completed the study. Mean (SD) LDX exposure was 284.3 (118.84) days; cumulative LDX exposure duration was 12 months or longer in 344 participants (57.4%). A total of 506 participants (84.5%) reported TEAEs (TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation, 54 [9.0%]; severe TEAEs, 42 [7.0%]; serious TEAEs, 17 [2.8%]). Treatment-emergent adverse events reported in greater than or equal to 10% of participants were dry mouth (27.2%), headache (13.2%), insomnia (12.4%), and upper respiratory tract infection (11.4%). Mean (SD) changes from antecedent study baseline in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, and weight at week 52/early termination (n = 597) were 2.19 (11.043) and 1.77 (7.848) mm Hg, 6.58 (10.572) beats per minute, and \u22127.04 (7.534) kg, respectively. On the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale, there were 2 positive responses for any active suicidal ideations; there were no positive responses for suicidal behavior or completed suicides. In this 12-month, open-label, extension study, the long-term safety and tolerability of LDX in adults with BED were generally consistent with its established profile for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder.",

Polaprezinc (zinc\u2013 l -carnosine complex) is a medication for gastric ulcers. A small case series reported successful treatment of binge eating with add-on polaprezinc. This was an open trial of add-on polaprezinc in patients with binge eating disorder (BED; n = 22) or bulimia nervosa (BN; n = 7) receiving antidepressants. A 4-week baseline period was followed by a 16-week polaprezinc treatment at 150 mg/d (containing 34 mg zinc and 116 mg l -carnosine) in addition to ongoing psychotropic medications. We also assessed their zinc status via a laboratory index and zinc deficiency\u2013related symptoms. At the study end, both conditions showed a significant reduction in the 4-week frequency of combined objective and subjective binge eating episodes, the 4-week frequency of days when at least 1 such episode occurred (only in BED), several aspects of eating disorder psychopathology (rated by the Eating Disorder Examination\u2013Questionnaire), and comorbid depressive symptoms (rated by the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology [Self-Report]). Serum copper/zinc ratio decreased from 1.4 to 1.1 on average in both conditions. All patients had multiple zinc deficiency\u2013related symptoms at baseline that substantially improved after polaprezinc treatment. Overall, the effectiveness of polaprezinc was greater in BED patients than in BN patients, with minor adverse effects. These findings offer preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of polaprezinc in treating BED and BN and suggest the involvement of zinc deficiency in these conditions.",

Questionnaire data were collected from breastfeeding Korean mothers who visited the pediatric clinic of Cheil General Hospital & Women's Healthcare Center from July 2015 through August 2015. The survey included items assessing maternal age, number of children, maternal educational attainment, household income, degree of difficulty with self-food restriction, types of self-restricted foods, dietary customs during breastfeeding, and sources of information about breastfeeding. The questionnaire was completed by 145 mothers. More than a third (n=56, 39%) had discomfort from and usually avoided 4\u20135 types of food (mean, 4.92). Mothers younger than 40 years had more discomfort (odds ratio [OR], 12.762; P =0.017). Primiparas felt less discomfort than multiparas (OR, 0.436; P =0.036). Dietary practices were not influenced by maternal educational attainment or household income. The most common self-restricted foods were caffeine (n=131, 90.3%), spicy foods (n=124, 85.5%), raw foods (n=109, 75.2%), cold foods (n=100, 69%), and sikhye (traditional sweet Korean rice beverage) (n=100, 69%). Most mothers (n=122, 84.1%) avoided foods for vague reasons. Most mothers restricted certain foods unnecessarily.

Furthermore, there is a gap in the evidence base for those with co-morbid obesity and atypical eating disorders, but it is likely that treatments which focus on linking past and present patterns of behaviour and emphasise cognitive, behavioural and emotional change will be most effective. A naturalistic single case design was used to pilot the feasibility of providing video therapy using the schema therapy mode model, which involves a range of \u2018active\u2019 techniques including chair work and imagery. Results suggest that videoconferencing may be well suited to the delivery of experiential psychotherapy, leading to change across several domains.

However, the effects of estrogen on feeding behavior in hungry animals remain unclear. In this study, we examined the roles of 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2) and ER\u03b1 in the regulation of feeding in hungry female animals and explored the underlying mechanisms. Wild-type female mice with surgical depletion of endogenous estrogens were used to examine the effects of E2 supplementation on acute refeeding behavior after starvation. ER\u03b1-C451A mutant mice deficient in membrane-bound ER\u03b1 activity and ER\u03b1-AF2 0 mutant mice lacking ER\u03b1 transcriptional activity were used to further examine mechanisms underlying acute feeding triggered by either fasting or central glucopenia (induced by intracerebroventricular injections of 2-deoxy- D -glucose). We also used electrophysiology to explore the impact of these ER\u03b1 mutations on the neural activities of ER\u03b1 neurons in the hypothalamus. In the wild-type female mice, ovariectomy reduced fasting-induced refeeding, which was restored by E2 supplementation. The ER\u03b1-C451A mutation, but not the ER\u03b1-AF2 0 mutation, attenuated acute feeding induced by either fasting or central glucopenia. The ER\u03b1-C451A mutation consistently impaired the neural responses of hypothalamic ER\u03b1 neurons to hypoglycemia. In addition to previous evidence that estrogen reduces deviations in energy balance by inhibiting eating at a satiated state, our findings demonstrate the unexpected role of E2 that promotes eating in hungry mice, also contributing to the stability of energy homeostasis. This latter effect specifically requires membrane-bound ER\u03b1 activity. \u2022 Endogenous E2 is required to maintain acute refeeding in hungry female mice after starvation. \u2022 Membrane-bound ER\u03b1 activity in female mice is required for efficient refeeding after starvation. \u2022 Membrane-bound ER\u03b1 activity is required for hypothalamic ER\u03b1 neurons to respond to hypoglycemia.

    "abstract": "In recent times, mental health problems have been on the increase worldwide. Among these are eating disorders. The current study aim was to assess the prevalence of the symptoms of eating disorders in patrons of sport centers in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia, and its association with patrons' sociodemographic, and exercise characteristics, as well as social media use. This cross-sectional study was conducted among 560 sport center clients. The Eating Attitude Test (EAT-26), as well as questions on sociodemographic, exercise, and the use of the social media was collected through self-administered questionnaires. Descriptive statistics, Chi-squared test, and Fischer's exact tests were performed. The prevalence of the symptoms of eating disorders was found to be 36.6% according to the results of the EAT-26. There were no significant differences in the rates of eating disorders between genders. Frequencies of eating disorder symptoms increased with an increase in the body mass index of the participants. In addition, more than half of the participants who were pressured by social media to be slim and perceived that social media influencers motivated them to go to the gym had eating disorders' symptoms. The prevalence of eating disorders symptoms was high among the sport center patrons examined. The findings from this study might help family physicians, mental health professionals, and sport medicine specialists wishing to understand this issue in Arab populations. Developing strategies regarding mental health in sport center patrons are suggested. In addition, a screening program is recommended for this population to identify those who need further evaluation and management.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about the applicability of mindfulness-based interventions in Spanish adults with overweight/obesity. The objective of the present study protocol is to describe the methods that will be used in a cluster randomised trial (CRT) that aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a mindfulness eating (ME) programme to reduce emotional eating (EE) in adults with overweight/obesity in primary care (PC) settings. A CRT will be conducted with approximately 76 adults with overweight/obesity from four PC health centres (clusters) in the city of Zaragoza, Spain. Health centres matched to the average per capita income of the assigned population will be randomly allocated into two groups: \u2018ME +treatment as usual (TAU)\u2019 and \u2018TAU alone\u2019. The ME programme will be composed of seven sessions delivered by a clinical psychologist, and TAU will be offered by general practitioners. The primary outcome will be EE measured by the Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (DEBQ) at post test as primary endpoint. Other outcomes will be external and restrained eating (DEBQ), binge eating (Bulimic Investigatory Test Edinburgh), eating disorder (Eating Attitude Test), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder-7), depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9), mindful eating (Mindful Eating Scale), dispositional mindfulness (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire) and self-compassion (Self-Compassion Scale). Anthropometric measures, vital signs and blood tests will be taken. A primary intention-to-treat analysis on EE will be conducted using linear mixed models. Supplementary analyses will include secondary outcomes and 1-year follow-up measures; adjusted models controlling for sex, weight status and levels of anxiety and depression; the complier average causal effect of treatment; and the clinical significance of improvements. Positive results of this study may have a significant impact on one of the most important current health-related problems. Approval was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the Regional Authority. The results will be submitted to peer-reviewed journals, and reports will be sent to participants.  NCT03927534 (5/2019).",

    "abstract": "Childhood obesity is a significant problem nowadays, with breastfeeding being one of many factors responsible for this issue. Breastfeeding as a natural way of feeding infants has many benefits for the child, the mother, and society. The present study aimed to investigate the association between overweight children in preschool age and breastfeeding duration. The current study included 674 preschool children aged 2-5 who attended various municipal kindergartens in South Athens. Questionnaires were given to parents where they recorded the child\u2019s personal and body data, parenting, and questions about pregnancy and lactation. The effect of BMI on the duration of breastfeeding in children was examined by the chi-square independence test. Fisher\u2019s and Monte Carlo simulations were also used. For data processing, Z scores and percentiles BMI for the first, second until fifth year of the child were found and based on these values the following categorization was performed; for values below -2 as low weight, values from -2 to 1 as normal weight, from 2 to 3 as overweight and over 3 as obese children. The Corresponding categorization was based on the 3rd, 85th, 97th, and 99.9th percentage position. The percentage of children at preschool age who have been breastfed for over six months and had normal weight was higher than those who breastfed below six months. Moreover, the proportion of children who were low weight, overweight and obese was lower in children who had been breastfed more than six months compared to those who breastfed for a shorter period. Additionally, a statistically significant difference was found for the effect of breastfeeding on childhood obesity in children aged 2 to 5 years. There is a statistical association between breastfeeding duration and body weight in preschool age. Breastfeeding for more than six months has a positive impact on the child\u2019s weight.",

This study presents the first investigation of how HVAC (heating, ventilation, air\u2010conditioning) operating conditions influence the dissemination of fluorescent tracer particles released in a BCU . Test conditions included normal HVAC operation and exhaust failure resulting in loss of negative pressure. A suspension of optical brightener powder and water was nebulized to produce fluorescent particles simulating droplet nuclei (0.5\u20105\u00a0\u03bcm). Airborne particle number concentrations were monitored by Instantaneous Biological Analyzers and Collectors ( FLIR Systems). During normal HVAC operation, fluorescent tracer particles were contained in the isolation room (average concentration\u00a0=\u00a01\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 4 \u00b1 3\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 3 /L air ). Under exhaust failure, the automated HVAC system maximizes airflow into areas adjacent to isolation rooms to attempt to maintain negative pressure differential. However, 6% of the fluorescent particles were transported through cracks around doors/door handles out of the isolation room via airflow alone and not by movement of personnel or doors. Overall, this study provides a systematic method for evaluating capabilities to contain aerosolized particles during various HVAC scenarios. Recommendations are provided to improve situation\u2010specific BCU safety.",

A case\u2013control study was conducted in 210 participants who were matched for age and sex and recruited sequentially from King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Demographic and anthropometric variables were measured in all study participants. Dietary intake was measured by food frequency questionnaire. Obesity was highly prevalent among the study population. The mean AHEI score for the total sample was found to be 58.3 \u00b1 1.67. There were no differences according to the presence and absence of atherosclerotic disease; 45% had a poor diet, and 39% had a diet that needs improvement. Participants with higher CIMT values tended to be of lower AHEI category. Negative correlations were observed between CIMT and AHEI scores and components after adjustment for age and energy intake. Adherence to a healthier diet, as reflected by a higher AHEI score, is associated with lower coronary risk, as estimated by CIMT value, independently from obesity and personal behavior factors.",

This pilot trial aimed to test the study feasibility procedures for a definitive trial of a behavioural lifestyle programme. This 24-week parallel two-arm randomised pilot trial took place in two hospitals in London, UK (April 2015\u2013June 2016). Sixty disease-free ECS within 3 years of diagnosis. Participants were randomised using minimisation to receive the intervention or care as usual. The \u2018Shape-Up following cancer treatment\u2019 programme used self-monitoring, goal-setting, self-incentives, problem-solving and group social support for 12\u2009hours over 8 weeks to help survivors improve their eating and physical activity. The main outcome measures were recruitment, adherence, and retention rates. Further outcomes included barriers to participation and feedback on programme satisfaction. Of the 296 potentially eligible ECS, 20% (n=60) were randomly allocated to the active intervention (n=29) or control group (n=31). Three participants in each arm were deemed ineligible after randomisation and excluded from analysis. Twenty participants (77%; 95%\u2009CI 61% to 93%) adhered to the intervention and provided generally favourable feedback. At 24 weeks, 25/26 (96%; 95%\u2009CI 89% to 100%) intervention and 24/28 (86%; 95%\u2009CI 73% to 99%) control participants completed their assessment. No intervention-related adverse events were reported. Among eligible survivors who declined study participation (n=83), inconvenience (78%; 95%\u2009CI 69% to 87%) was the most common barrier. The trial was feasible to deliver based on the a priori feasibility criteria.

Subsequently, important implications have been derived for treatment of those disorders and even political actions. However, studies on the prevalence of food addiction are rare. Few recent studies investigated addictive eating in children, adolescents, and adults. This mini-review presents these first attempts to assess addictive eating and how prevalent addictive eating patterns were in the respective studies. It is concluded that the prevalence of food addiction is increased in obese individuals and even more so in obese patients with binge eating disorder. However, prevalence of food addiction is not sufficient to account for the obesity epidemic. Conversely, an arguably high prevalence of food addiction can also be found in under-, normal-, and overweight individuals. Future studies may investigate which factors are associated with addictive eating in non-obese individuals.",

Links between obesity and complications from COVID\u221219 have been identified, but it is unknown whether weight stigma poses adverse health implications during this pandemic. We examined longitudinal associations between prepandemic experiences of weight stigma and eating behaviors, psychological distress, and physical activity during the COVID-19 pandemic in a diverse sample of emerging adults. Participants ( N = 584, 64% female, mean age = 24.6 \u00b1 2.0 years, mean body mass index [BMI] = 28.2) in the COVID-19 Eating and Activity over Time (C-EAT) study were cohort members of the population-based longitudinal study EAT 2010\u20132018. Weight stigma reported by participants in 2018 was examined as a predictor of binge eating, eating to cope, physical activity, depressive symptoms, and stress during COVID-19. Data were collected via online surveys during the U.S. outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020. Prepandemic experiences of weight stigma predicted higher levels of depressive symptoms (\u03b2 = 0.15 , p < .001), stress (\u03b2 = 0.15 , p = .001), eating as a coping strategy (\u03b2 = 0.16 , p < .001), and an increased likelihood of binge eating (odds ratio = 2.88, p < .001) among young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic but were unrelated to physical activity. Although associations remained after accounting for demographic characteristics and BMI, the magnitude of longitudinal associations was attenuated after adjusting for prior levels of the outcome variables. Young adults who have experienced weight stigma may have increased vulnerability to distress and maladaptive eating during this pandemic. Public health messaging could be improved to support people of diverse body sizes and reduce the harmful consequences of weight stigma. Young adults who experienced weight stigma prior to the COVID-19 pandemic endorsed higher levels of depressive symptoms, stress, eating to cope, and binge eating during the pandemic than those who had never experienced weight stigma.",

The magnetite\u2010containing agar piece was heated more than the magnetite\u2010free agar phantom, and the specific adsorption rate in the phantom was increased 1.5 times by the magnetite particles. The temperature distribution in the large agar phantom showed that the highest temperature was obtained at the center of the magnetite\u2010containing piece. The rate of temperature increase was approximately proportional to the magnetite concentration to the power 0.8. This method was applied to an in vivo experiment using a pig. Magnetite was prepared as a colloidal material dispersed in a carboxymethylcellulose solution (CMC\u2010Mag) and intramuscularly injected in the pig femur. As a result of 8 MHz\u2010RF heating, the temperature at the CMC\u2010Mag\u2010injected point increased to over 43\u00b0C after 7 min, while the temperature at a point without magnetite was under 40\u00b0C at the same time.

    "abstract": "Neuroimaging studies investigating the neural profile of anorexia nervosa (AN) have revealed a predominant imbalance between the reward and inhibition systems of the brain, which are also hallmark characteristics of the disorder. However, little is known whether these changes can also be determined independent of task condition, using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, in currently ill AN patients. Therefore the aim of our study was to investigate resting-state connectivity in AN patients ( n =\u00a012) compared to healthy athlete ( n =\u00a012) and non-athlete ( n =\u00a014) controls. For this purpose, we used degree centrality to investigate functional connectivity of the whole-brain network and then Granger causality to analyze effective connectivity (EC), to understand directional aspects of potential alterations. We were able to show that the bilateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) is a region of special functional importance within the whole-brain network, in AN patients, revealing reduced functional connectivity compared to both healthy control groups. Furthermore, we found decreased EC from the right IFG to the midcingulum and increased EC from the bilateral orbitofrontal gyrus to the right IFG. For the left IFG, we only observed increased EC from the bilateral insula to the left IFG. These results suggest that AN patients have reduced connectivity within the cognitive control system of the brain and increased connectivity within regions important for salience processing. Due to its fundamental role in inhibitory behavior, including motor response, altered integrity of the inferior frontal cortex could contribute to hyperactivity in AN. \u2022 We evaluate resting-state functional (FC) and effective (EC) connectivity. \u2022 We compare anorexia nervosa (AN) patients with healthy controls. \u2022 AN patients show reduced FC in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). \u2022 AN patients show reduced EC from the IFG and increased EC to the IFG. \u2022 Altered FC patterns correlate with physical activity.

However, the principal neurons generating the orexigenic function in the DMH remain to be defined. This study aimed to clarify the role of the DMH GABAergic neurons in feeding regulation by using optogenetics and electrophysiological techniques.

As reference standard for anorexia, two external criteria were used: (1) a cut-off value of \u22652 on the anorexia symptom scale of the EORTC QLQ C-30 and (2) the question \u201cDo you experience a decreased appetite?\u201d (yes/no). ROC curves were used to examine the optimal cut-off values for the FAACT\u2013A/CS and VAS. A total of 273 patients (58\u00a0% male; 64.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a010.6\u00a0years) were included. The median score on the FAACT\u2013A/CS was 38 (IQR 32\u201342) points and 77 (IQR 47\u201393) points on the VAS. Considering both external criteria, the optimal cut-off value for the FAACT\u2013A/CS was \u226437 (sensitivity (se) 80\u00a0%, specificity (sp) 81\u00a0%, positive predictive value (PV + ) 79\u00a0%, negative predictive value (PV \u2212 ) 82\u00a0%) and for the VAS was \u226470 (se 76\u00a0%, sp 83\u00a0%, PV + 80\u00a0%, PV \u2212 79\u00a0%). For the assessment of anorexia in patients with cancer, our study suggests cut-off values of \u226437 for the FAACT\u2013A/CS and \u226470 for the VAS. Future studies should confirm our findings in other patient samples.",

It provides the infant's physical growth and is responsive to its emotional needs. Since determining the knowledge and attitude of girls in this period and promoting, it is considered as the main principle in motivating them for choosing this method in future. This descriptive-correlational study was conducted to determine the knowledge and attitude of 630 high-school students on breastfeeding at a selected public high school in Tehran, Iran in 2018. A researcher-made questionnaire was administered to collect the data, to determine the validity of the tool; content validity was used and to determine its reliability, a test re-test method was applied. Data were analyzed by the nonparametric tests of Chi-square, multiple comparisons, and Spearman correlation coefficient. The results showed that 80.3% had moderate knowledge. The mean score of knowledge in the human sciences group was significantly higher than others. Furthermore, the attitude of 22.5% of girls was positive, 77.5% had no idea, none of them had negative attitudes. There was a statistically significant difference between the mean score of attitude of the students in groups of knowledge (good, moderate, and weak) ( P < 0.01), and multiple comparison tests showed that the positive attitude score in the moderate knowledge group was more than the attitude score in weak and good knowledge. The results indicate that there is an unbiased attitude about the moderate knowledge of different aspects of breastfeeding among pre university students, although they have a moderate knowledge on a complete and successful breast feeding.",

This study explores the sources of support among users of Facebook breastfeeding support groups and a possible mechanism by which support received on Facebook may translate to behavioral outcomes among breastfeeding mothers. From July\u2013September 2017 a survey was distributed online to African American mothers ( N =\u2009277) who participate in breastfeeding support groups on Facebook. The survey assessed network support from Facebook and other sources of breastfeeding support, perceived breastfeeding norms, breastfeeding self-efficacy and breastfeeding attitudes. Correlations and linear regression analysis were used to examine the relationship between covariates and outcome variables. The average intended breastfeeding duration among participants in this study was 19 months. Participants reported the highest amount of breastfeeding support received from their Facebook support group, in comparison to other sources of support, and Facebook support was significantly correlated with intended breastfeeding duration ( p <\u20090.05). Self-efficacy and breastfeeding attitudes remained significant predictors of intended breastfeeding duration within the final regression model. Breastfeeding support received within Facebook groups may compensate for inadequate support received within mothers\u2019 networks. More research is needed to understand the mechanism through which Facebook support may contribute to prolonged breastfeeding durations.",

Maintenance of R. rickettsii in nature depends on horizontal transmission along tick generations. Although such transmission is known to occur when uninfected and infected ticks feed simultaneously on susceptible animals (co-feeding systemic transmission), we investigated co-feeding nonsystemic transmission, which was based on R. rickettsii \u2013infected and \u2013uninfected A. aureolatum ticks feeding simultaneously on guinea pigs immune to R. rickettsii . Our acquisition and transmission infestations demonstrated that horizontal transmission of R. rickettsii by co-feeding ticks on immune hosts with no systemic infection did not occur when uninfected larvae fed distantly from infected nymphs but did occur in a few cases when uninfected larvae fed side-by-side with infected nymphs, suggesting that they shared the same feeding site. The co-feeding nonsystemic transmission type might have no epidemiologic importance for Rocky Mountain spotted fever.",

Student binge drinkers have reduced performance on learning a 24-word list. This is due to low proficiency in encoding, storage and retrieval processes. Memory processes are impacted by consumption speed and intoxication episodes. Academic failure described among binge drinkers could be partly related to findings. Many studies have emphasized the harmful impact of binge drinking on several cognitive functions, including memory. However, the exact nature of the memory processes involved is still unknown. The present study was designed to assess verbal working memory and verbal episodic memory, especially its encoding, storage and retrieval processes, in binge drinking to identify the processes impacted by this behavior. Participants were 48 community-recruited college students aged 18\u201325\u00a0years and categorized as either binge drinkers (BDs) or social drinkers (SDs). They were assessed with (a) subtests of the Wechsler scale (digit span, letter\u2013number sequencing) measuring verbal working memory, and (b) a modified version of the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT), which measures verbal episodic memory functioning in various conditions of encoding (controlled) and recollection (free recall, cued recall, and recognition). Verbal working memory was unaffected by binge drinking, whereas verbal episodic memory performances were reduced. In particular, analysis of the modified FCSRT scores suggested that BDs had less proficient storage and retrieval processes. Furthermore, correlational analyses indicated that the proficiency of these memory components was negatively correlated with several indicators of binge drinking behavior. Results suggest that binge drinking behavior affects the storage and recollection processes of verbal episodic memory. The academic failure described in binge drinkers could be partly related to this harmful effect. Our results on the negative impact of binge drinking on memory should be used to develop information campaigns targeting students.",

Such exploration is the purpose of the present study. The subjects included in the study were 152 female clinicians, 1052 females randomly selected from the general population, and 184 eating-disorder patients. All subjects rated 17 recovery items on a 10-point scale in terms of their relevance and importance. They also completed measures of knowledge about eating disorders and their own eating problems, in addition to providing information about their age and personal acquaintance with eating disorders. Fourteen recovery-item scores were sample unspecific, and hence all samples tended to judge the majority of items in a similar manner. The 17 items successfully formed three separate factors covering specific eating-disorder symptoms, as well as social and psychological issues. The clinician and general population sample analyzed together provided a more condensed scale comprising two factors (specific eating-disorder symptoms and psychosocial factors), with each factor having three items. This factor structure was successfully replicated using the patient-validation sample. The findings indicate an empirical basis for a valid recovery measure that may be suitable in future outcome research.",

Hence, knowledge, attitudes and cultural practices of mothers are vital in prevention of this. The present study was carried out to assess the mother's knowledge about feeding practices and its influence on primary dentition. The current study was a cross-sectional study of 187 mothers of 3- to 5-year-old children identified with malocclusion, conducted in the pedodontics department of tertiary care teaching dental hospital in South India. Majority of the mothers were graduates (31.6%) or undergraduates or postgraduates (42.8%). The duration of breastfeeding was 0\u20133 months in 9.1%, 3\u20136 months in 23%, 6\u201312 months in 30.5%, and >12 months in 37.5%. Bottle-feeding was reported by 21.4%. Only 52.4% of the mothers were aware about caries, and 66.2% were aware of malocclusion. The prevalence of malocclusion was 63.6% in study population, and the prevalence of caries was 30.5%. The most common type of malocclusion was overjet seen in 20.9% of study subjects. The proportion of children with crowding, open bite, and crossbite was 17.1, 15, and 10.7%, respectively. There was a gradually increasing trend in malocclusion awareness with increasing educational status of the mother which was statistically not significant ( p value = 0.119). The proportion of malocclusion was highest in children who received breastfeeding between 3 months and 6 months and was highest (69.8%) in children who received bottle-feeding for more than 12 months. None of the factors had shown a statistically significant association with malocclusion in study population. The prevalence of malocclusion is high in children, and mothers\u2019 awareness regarding malocclusion is poor.

To evaluate E. delhiensis as a biocontrol agent in greenhouse, the killing efficiency of this parasitoid by parasitism and host-feeding, were studied. Killing efficiency can be compared by estimation of functional response parameters. Laboratory experiments were performed in controllable conditions to evaluate the functional response of E. delhiensis at eight densities (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 100, and 120 third nymphal stage) of Trialeurodes vaporariorum (Hemiptera, Aleyrodidae) on two hosts including; tomato and prickly lettuce. The maximum likelihood estimates from regression logistic analysis revealed type II functional response for two host plants and the type of functional response was not affected by host plant. Roger\u2019s model was used to fit the data. The attack rate ( a ) for E. delhiensis was 0.0286 and 0.0144 per hour on tomato and 0.0434 and 0.0170 per hour on prickly lettuce for parasitism and host feeding, respectively.

The experiments involved feeding the experimental group cats twice their daily energy requirement with a commercial diet for 4 weeks. The control group was fed the estimated daily energy requirement with the same diet. Body weight, feline body mass index, body condition score, several zoometry measurements, and plasma metabolites/hepatic injury markers were measured in all the cats before and after the experiment. In addition, the fatty acid profiles in the liver and subcutaneous adipose tissue were measured after the experiment. After 4 weeks of overfeeding, the experimental group demonstrated significant increases in hepatic C18:1, plasma triglyceride, and nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentrations and in alanine aminotransferase activity. Furthermore, hepatic SCD-1 indices were positively correlated with body weight, feline body mass index, body condition score, and plasma NEFA concentration, although subcutaneous adipose tissue did not demonstrate any increase in SCD-1 indices in this study. The increase in hepatic SCD-1 indices might be enhanced by the inflow of plasma NEFA into the liver, and NEFA toxicity might stimulate C18:1 synthesis by SCD-1.",

The various problems characteristic to the puerperal period make mothers more prone than ever to stress, anxiety and depression. The aim of this study was to determine relationship between psychological factors and social support and breastfeeding process in mothers presenting to healthcare centers in Shahrood, Iran. The present cross-sectional study was conducted on 465 mothers with infants aged one to six months, presenting to Shahrood healthcare centers in 2015\u201316. Data were obtained using a researcher-designed demographic and breastfeeding questionnaire, the Beck Depression Inventory, Spielberger\u2019s State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Cohen\u2019s Perceived Stress Scale and the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support. Data were analyzed in SPSS-18 using measures of central tendency, the Chi-square test, the t-test, Mann-Whitney\u2019s test and Fisher\u2019s exact test and Logistic Regression Model. The level of statistical significance was set at p<0.05. The prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding was 68.4% in the study population. The results revealed a significant relationship between state and trait anxiety and exclusive breastfeeding (p=0.004 and p=0.006, respectively). According to the results of the logistic regression, each unit of increase in the mother\u2019s mean state of anxiety protects the chances of non-exclusive breastfeeding up to about 54% (OR=0.462). The findings suggest that maternal anxiety can reduce the chances of exclusive breastfeeding. It is therefore recommended to actively monitor and manage maternal anxiety in the postpartum period so as to support exclusive breastfeeding.",

Interviewer administered structured questionnaire was used for data collection. Data were entered and analyzed by using SPSS version 20.0. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of delayed initiation of breastfeeding and non-exclusive breastfeeding. The prevalence of suboptimal breast feeding of infants was found to be 56.9%. Nearly half (49.4%) of the mothers delayed initiation of breast feeding, and 13.4% of the infants were fed breast non-exclusively.

To maintain this high breastfeeding rate, it is important to understand the factors that influence breastfeeding. A doctor s advice can improve the rates of breastfeeding initiation and duration, but not all doctors are competent in breastfeeding counselling. The aim of this study was to identify the knowledge and beliefs of general practitioners (GPs) about breastfeeding in Norway and to investigate how important they considered guidance about breastfeeding initiation and duration before and after birth. A questionnaire study about knowledge and beliefs according to predefined correct responses and about self-perceived competence as an advisor. 122 GPs engaged in apprenticeship for medical students. The response rate was 57%, 69 GPs participated. The questions were answered correctly according to national consensus for 49 % for the knowledge items and 64 % of the belief items. The GPs believed that their guidance was more important after than before birth. Female GPs had more confidence in their guidance ability than male GPs. Confidence in the GPs own guidance after birth was associated with knowledge about contraindications to breastfeeding. Although the GPs expressed beliefs favouring breastfeeding they partly lacked basic knowledge. The GPs confidence in own guidance was better after than before birth and was higher among those with more knowledge. Improved knowledge and emphasis on guidance before birth should be promoted among GPs. Key points Breastfeeding is the best infant-feeding method.

In this view, these two organizations promoted a worldwide campaign for breastfeeding, creating the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) that encourages good practices for the promotion of breastfeeding in hospitals. The aim of our study was to review the available evidence regarding the positive effects of breastfeeding, in order to suggest to most appropriate strategy to support it. The main databases including Scopus, PubMed, MEDLINE, Google scholar and Science Direct were researched to obtain the original papers related to breastfeeding education. The main terms used to literature search were \u201cBreastfeeding education\u201d, Breastfeeding support\u201d, and \u201cBreastfeeding healthcare policy\u201d. The timeframe included the obtained articles was from 1980 to 2015. Our analysis confirms that healthcare providers play a pivotal role in education and encouraging mothers to begin and continue breastfeeding. In this view, the adequate training of healthcare providers seems to be mandatory in order to support this practice. Moreover, adequate facilities are needed in order to promote and support breastfeeding. Considering the available evidence, breastfeeding should be supported among all the mothers. Based on the positive data emerging from the public awareness campaign in different Countries of the world, we strongly encourage an accurate training for doctors and midwives and the implementation of adequate facilities in order to support breastfeeding.",

Compared with PA\u2212/HE\u2212, age\u2010sex\u2010race\u2010adjusted hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for all\u2010cause mortality for PA\u2212/HE+, PA+/HE\u2212, and PA+/HE+ groups were 0.96 (0.76\u20131.21), 0.61 (0.52\u20130.71), and 0.62 (0.52\u20130.75), respectively. These associations remained unchanged after multivariable adjustment and were similar for cardiovascular and non\u2010cardiovascular mortalities. Respective demographic\u2010adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for incident HF among 1954 participants without baseline HF were 1.21 (0.81\u20131.81), 0.71 (0.54\u20130.94), and 0.71 (0.51\u20130.98). These latter associations lost significance after multivariable adjustment. Among community\u2010dwelling older adults with normal BMI, physical activity, regardless of healthy eating, was associated with lower risk of mortality and incident HF, but healthy eating had no similar protective association in this cohort.",

Independent samples T-tests or \u03c7\u00b2 tests for between-group differences and paired-samples T-tests and repeated measures analysis of variance for within group differences were used. No group differences in fertility problems, miscarriage, preterm birth or low birth weight were found. Both groups decreased training volume all trimesters and the first two postpartum periods compared with prepregnancy, and more athletes returned to sport/exercise at week 0\u20136 postpartum. We found no group differences in complications during pregnancy and delivery, but athletes reported fewer common complaints. Four athletes experienced stress fracture postpartum. Athletes had higher BD and DT postpartum, while controls reduced DT score. Number of athletes with clinical ED was reduced postpartum, while constant in controls. Athletes were not satisfied with advice related to strength training and nutrition during pregnancy. Elite athletes and active controls get pregnant easily, deliver healthy babies and decrease training during pregnancy and the first postpartum periods compared with prepregnancy. Most athletes and every third control returned to sport or exercise at week 0\u20136 postpartum. Athletes report stress fractures and increased BD and DT, but decreased ED postpartum. However, since relatively few athletes were included these findings need further investigation.",

    "abstract": "Daily feed intake ( DFI ) is an important consideration for improving feed efficiency, but measurements using electronic feeder systems contain many missing and incorrect values. Therefore, we evaluated three methods for correcting missing DFI data (quadratic, orthogonal polynomial, and locally weighted (Loess) regression equations) and assessed the effects of these missing values on the genetic parameters and the estimated breeding values ( EBV ) for feeding traits. DFI records were obtained from 1622 Duroc pigs, comprising 902 individuals without missing DFI and 720 individuals with missing DFI . The Loess equation\u00a0was the most suitable method for correcting the missing DFI values in 5\u201350% randomly deleted datasets among the three equations. Both variance components and heritability for the average DFI ( ADFI ) did not change because of the missing DFI proportion and Loess correction. In terms of rank correlation and information criteria, Loess correction improved the accuracy of EBV for ADFI compared to randomly deleted cases. These findings indicate that the Loess equation\u00a0is useful for correcting missing DFI values for individual pigs and that the correction of missing DFI values could be effective for the estimation of breeding values and genetic improvement using EBV for feeding traits.",

The aim of the study was to evaluate if mirtazapine has any effect on gastric emptying in patients suffering from cancer-related anorexia. Solid-meal gastric-emptying study using radiolabeled meal was performed in 28 patients suffering from cancer anorexia once at baseline and repeated after 15 days of mirtazapine therapy. At baseline, only 7 (25%) patients had normal gastric motility (emptying >70% at 3 h postingestion) whereas after treatment, 18 (64.2%) patients achieved this limit. Mean % gastric emptying increased from 55.2% \u00b121.0% to 68.9% \u00b121.3% ( P < 0.001). Mean gastric emptying time (t 1/2 ) before intervention was 314.7 \u00b1 421.0 min which decreased to 116.0 \u00b1 106.7 min after intervention. Results were further analyzed by dividing the patients into two groups based on baseline gastric-emptying study. Group A (normal gastric emptying) consisted of seven patients, mean % gastric emptying at baseline and postintervention was 75.0% \u00b15.25% and 87.57% \u00b15.94%, respectively ( P < 0.018).

    "abstract": "The aim of our study was to determine the central and peripheral autonomic nervous system profiles underlying anorexia nervosa (AN) syndrome, given that affected patients present with the opposite clinical profile to that seen in the hyperinsulinism syndrome. We measured blood pressure and heart rate, as well as circulating neurotransmitters (noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, plasma serotonin, and platelet serotonin), using high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, during supine resting, one minute of orthostasis, and after five minutes of exercise. In total, 22 AN patients (12 binge-eating/purging type and 10 restricting type) and age-, gender-, and race-matched controls (70 \u00b1 10.1% versus 98 \u00b1 3.0% of ideal body weight) were recruited. We found that patients with AN had adrenal sympathetic overactivity and neural sympathetic underactivity, demonstrated by a predominance of circulating adrenaline over noradrenaline levels, not only during the supine resting state (52 \u00b1 2 versus 29 \u00b1 1 pg/mL) but also during orthostasis (67 \u00b1 3 versus 32 \u00b1 2 pg/mL, P < 0.05) and after exercise challenge (84 \u00b1 4 versus 30 \u00b1 3 pg/mL, P < 0.01). Considering that this peripheral autonomic nervous system disorder depends on the absolute predominance of adrenomedullary C1 adrenergic nuclei over A5 noradrenergic pontine nucleus, let us ratify the abovementioned findings. The AN syndrome depends on the predominance of overwhelming adrenal sympathetic activity over neural sympathetic activity. This combined central and autonomic nervous system profile contrasts with that registered in patients affected by hyperinsulinism, hypoglycemia, and bulimia syndrome which depends on the absolute predominance of neural sympathetic activity.",

    "abstract": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has provided detailed guidance on the care of infants of women who are persons under investigation (PUI) or confirmed to have COVID\u201019. The guidance supports immediate post\u2010partum mother\u2013infant contact and breastfeeding with appropriate respiratory precautions. Although many countries have followed WHO guidance, others have implemented infection prevention and control (IPC) policies that impose varying levels of post\u2010partum separation and discourage or prohibit breastfeeding or provision of expressed breast milk. These policies aim to protect infants from the potential harm of infection from their mothers, yet they may fail to fully account for the impact of separation. Global COVID\u201019 data are suggestive of potentially lower susceptibility and a typically milder course of disease among children, although the potential for severe disease in infancy remains. Separation causes cumulative harms, including disrupting breastfeeding and limiting its protection against infectious disease, which has disproportionate impacts on vulnerable infants. Separation also presumes the replaceability of breastfeeding\u2014a risk that is magnified in emergencies. Moreover, separation does not ensure lower viral exposure during hospitalizations and post\u2010discharge, and contributes to the burden on overwhelmed health systems. Finally, separation magnifies maternal health consequences of insufficient breastfeeding and compounds trauma in communities who have experienced long\u2010standing inequities and violence, including family separation. Taken together, separating PUI/confirmed SARS\u2010CoV\u20102\u2010positive mothers and their infants may lead to excess preventable illnesses and deaths among infants and women around the world. Health services must consider the short\u2010andlong\u2010term impacts of separating mothers and infants in their policies.",

However, there is no longitudinal study on whether habitual night eating, regardless of diet quality and energy intake, is associated with arterial stiffness, a major etiological factor in the development of cardiovascular disease. The study included 7771 adult participants without cardiovascular disease, cancer, or diabetes mellitus prior to dietary assessment by a validated food frequency questionnaire in 2014 through 2015. Participants were categorized into 3 groups based on self\u2010reported night\u2010eating habits: never or rarely, some days (1\u20135\u00a0times per week), or most days (6+\u00a0times per week). Arterial stiffness was assessed by brachial\u2010ankle pulse wave velocity at baseline and repeatedly during follow\u2010ups. Mean differences and 95% CIs in the yearly change rate of brachial\u2010ankle pulse wave velocity across the 3 groups were calculated, adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status, total energy intake, diet quality, sleep quality, and other cardiovascular disease risk factors. At baseline, 6625 (85.2%), 610 (7.8%), and 536 (6.9%) participants reported night eating as never or rarely, some days, or most days, respectively. During a mean 3.19\u00a0years, we observed a positive association between night\u2010eating frequency and progression of arterial stiffness ( P trend=0.01).

This association was only significant in women, but not in men ( P interaction=0.03). In an adult population free of major chronic diseases, habitual night eating was positively associated with the progression of arterial stiffness, a hallmark of arteriosclerosis and biological aging.

    "abstract": "Breast feeding can promote positive long-term and short-term health outcomes in infant and mother. The UK has one of the lowest breastfeeding rates (duration and exclusivity) in the world, resulting in preventable morbidities and associated healthcare costs. Breastfeeding rates are also socially patterned, thereby potentially contributing to health inequalities. Financial incentives have been shown to have a positive effect on health behaviours in previously published studies. Based on data from earlier development and feasibility stages, a cluster (electoral ward) randomised trial with mixed-method process and content evaluation was designed. The \u2018Nourishing Start for Health\u2019 (NOSH) intervention comprises a financial incentive programme of up to 6\u2005months duration, delivered by front-line healthcare professionals, in addition to existing breastfeeding support. The intervention aims to increase the prevalence and duration of breast feeding in wards with low breastfeeding rates. The comparator is usual care (no offer of NOSH intervention). Routine data on breastfeeding rates at 6\u20138\u2005weeks will be collected for 92 clusters (electoral wards) on an estimated 10\u2005833 births. This sample is calculated to provide 80% power in determining a 4% point difference in breastfeeding rates between groups. Content and process evaluation will include interviews with mothers, healthcare providers, funders and commissioners of infant feeding services. The economic analyses, using a healthcare provider's perspective, will be twofold, including a within-trial cost-effectiveness analysis and beyond-trial modelling of longer term expectations for cost-effectiveness. Results of economic analyses will be expressed as cost per percentage point change in cluster level in breastfeeding rates between trial arms. In addition, we will present difference in resource use impacts for a range of acute conditions in babies aged 0\u20136\u2005months. Participating organisations Research and Governance departments approved the study. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and at conference presentations. ISRCTN44898617; Pre-results.",

The present study was aimed to determine the factors affecting the breast-feeding continuation effectively for a selected region of Iran. This cross-sectional study was performed on 523 women having less than two year old babies from the selected counties covered by the Zahedan University of Medical Sciences (Khash, Saravan, Sarbaz, Chabahar, Zahedan, Nikshahr, Iranshahr, and Konark) using the stratified sampling method. The Data was completed for the target group by using the check-list which included 3 parts: demographic data, case history of pregnancy, childbirth and mother\u2019s statue, and previous records of the newborn up to two years. The obtained data were fed into SPSS software, and all parametric and non-parametric statistical methods were used to analyze the data, especially appropriate to the data type. The results showed that the most important factors associated with breast-feeding discontinuation were infant\u2019s illness (only up to six months), mother\u2019s consciousness, parental support, practical breastfeeding training to the mother, mother\u2019s educational level, child\u2019s gender, place of birth, pregnancies\u2019 interval, mother\u2019s ethnicity and residence and the statue of taking (using) narcotics. The data also indicated that on maternal reasons the main factor which impelled most of the mothers to discontinue their breast-feeding up to six months or even before two years was milk shortage in mother\u2019s breasts. Moreover, the main child- related factor that compelled most of the mothers for non-continuance of their breast-feeding up to six months or even before two years was child\u2019s crying and discomfort. It can be safely concluded that promotion of parental education, neglecting child\u2019s gender as far as cultural context and preference of a son is considered, observance of pregnancy interval for more than three years, non-smoking in nursing mothers, practical training of breast-feeding to mothers besides conductance of educative programs via maternity hospitals and health centers to educate parents about the importance of breast-feeding and benefits of spouse\u2019s support can be considered as the influential factors in continuation of breast-feeding.",

Despite its demonstrated benefits, exclusive breast-feeding practice in many countries including Ethiopia is lower than the international recommendation. However, studies about exclusive breast-feeding in the study area are limited. Therefore, this study aimed to fill this gap. Community-based cross-sectional study was employed. A cluster sampling method was used to select 577 women who had a child aged <12 months. Data were collected using a pretested interviewer-administered questionnaire. Epi-Data version 3.1 and SPSS version 21 were used for data entry and analysis. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regressions \ufeffwere used to analyze the association between the dependent and independent variables.

Those women who initiated breast-feeding early were 12 times more likely to breastfeed than those women who did not initiate early at (AOR = 12.336 [95% CI = 1.331, 14.316]). The overall exclusive breast-feeding practice among the women was found to be less. Age, information on breast-feeding and early initiation of breast-feeding were found as important predictors of exclusive breast-feeding.

However, the clinical manifestations of adrenocortical insufficiency may be atypical: anorexia, ascites, impaired liver function, and alacrima have been reported. Jaundice and anorexia presenting together in the same patient as the main symptoms are rare. We present a rare case of a 65-year-old woman diagnosed as having adrenocortical insufficiency with chief complaints of anorexia and jaundice. The patient had a history of hiatus hernia and gastroesophageal reflux disease, which can easily lead to a misdiagnosis in clinical practice, which is what happened with this patient at the beginning in our hospital and in the other hospitals that treated her previously. Hiatus hernia was considered the mostly likely cause of her vomiting, and a laparotomy was done to repair the hernia at the local hospital. However, there was no improvement. After regular glucocorticoid replacement, the patient\u2019s symptoms all soon disappeared. Adrenal insufficiency can atypically present as anorexia and jaundice.

However, this relationship has not been investigated yet. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the number of musculoskeletal pain regions was associated with picky eating, which was characterized by food intake balance of familiar products or self-identification. A total of 4660 adult subjects were enrolled in this study. Picky eating was assessed in two ways; a countable score and self-identification of picky eating. For the countable score, the number of food items, which the subjects usually did not consume among a list of 11 familiar products was measured. Self-identification as a picky eater was defined through a single question. The presence of musculoskeletal pain; in the neck, low back, knee, back, or arm, within 2\u00a0months of the survey was also identified. Of all subjects, 2654 (56%) had musculoskeletal pain in at least one region. The prevalence of musculoskeletal pain in every region was seen as consistently higher in subjects who self-identified as picky eaters than those who were non-picky eaters. In multiple linear regression analysis, the number of pain regions was significantly associated with older age, females, self-identification as a picky eater, and low body weight, not but the countable score.

The child had been partially breast-fed, and the mother used topiramate for epilepsy. Hospital examination excluded a viral or bacterial infection and failed to identify any other potential cause. After two weeks, topiramate exposure was suspected to be the cause, and breast-feeding was suspended. The diarrhea ceased within 2\u00a0days. Analysis of the breast milk showed a topiramate concentration of 15.7\u00a0\u03bcmol/L (5.3\u00a0\u03bcg/mL). There is little information on the use of topiramate in breast-feeding women. The potential effects on the children are not known. Topiramate passes into breast milk, and the concentration may equal the therapeutic plasma concentration. In this case, the infant may have ingested up to 40% of the mother's weight-adjusted dose. Diarrhea is a well-known adverse reaction to topiramate and has the potential to cause serious electrolyte disturbances in neonates and infants. The condition improved rapidly after suspension of breast-feeding. Topiramate in breast milk may reach levels that cause adverse effects in infants. Based on the adverse reaction profile of topiramate and the milk concentration, the diarrhea was assessed as a probable adverse drug reaction in the infant.",

Although the impact of breastfeeding support has been well established, there is a lack of consistency in the development and evaluation of support models. This report examines two differing populations of Baby Caf\u00e9 attendees. The study evaluated the mother's achievement of personal and nationally recommended breastfeeding goals, the frequency of attending a Baby Caf\u00e9, and their ratings of the program as helpful in solving breastfeeding problems. Methods: A total of 559 mothers attending two Baby Caf\u00e9s, one in Massachusetts and the other in southern Texas, were surveyed when their babies were 6 months old and again over age 12 months. Actual breastfeeding duration was compared with the mothers' initially stated goals and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommended goals, and then evaluated against the number of Caf\u00e9 attendances. The mother's rating of the Caf\u00e9 for helpfulness was measured using a 1\u20135 effectiveness scale. Results: Results show that mothers attending either of the surveyed Baby Caf\u00e9s that served distinctly different populations reported higher breastfeeding exclusivity rates and higher rates of 12-month breastfeeding duration than national rates reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). More than 70% of all mothers surveyed rated the Caf\u00e9 as most effective. Conclusions: The Baby Caf\u00e9 model was shown to be effective at helping mothers reach breastfeeding goals regardless of the Caf\u00e9's different geographical settings and the socioeconomic characteristics of the populations served.",

    "abstract": "Recently, the incidence of obesity, especially extreme obesity, has significantly increased. It is connected with inappropriate lifestyle, including a high calorie diet, psychological and genetic factors, some medications, diseases or infectious factors. Nowadays, the consumption of food is not only to satisfy a physiological need, but also fulfils psychological needs. The most effective method of morbid obesity treatment is metabolic surgery. Moreover, food is considered to be a reward and method of coping with stress. In order to improve the efficiency of the surgical treatment, it seems significant to assess the effects of psychological factors on eating behaviours. To evaluate the effects of stress on eating habits that increase the risk of extreme obesity. The study included 50 subjects qualified for bariatric surgery. The authors\u2019 own questionnaire and standardised PSS-10 questionnaire by Cohen, Kamarcki and Mermelstein adapted by Juczy\u0144ski and Ogi\u0144ska-Bulik were used. These questionnaires indicated that patients felt a moderate levels of stress but with a tendency for high levels. The majority of respondents declared an increased appetite due to stress-causing factors. Reasons for snacking most frequently included negative emotions and feeling like eating something. Consumption of additional snacks was a way of coping with stress. Most frequently the subjects ate sweets and salty snacks, but also sandwiches, nuts, fruit and alcohol beverages. Psychological support may help morbidly obese people both to change nutritional habits and to cope with stress.",

A major tamoxifen administration is performed by intraperitoneal administration or oral administration. However, these forced administrations may be damaging to mice. Herein, we have demonstrated an improved method of administering tamoxifen with powdered food to mice. A mouse line expressing the tamoxifen-inducible Cre gene was used ubiquitously in this experiment to evaluate the efficiency of Cre recombination in the whole body. Our method also achieved efficient recombination without causing injury to mice. The X-gal staining intensity of the feeding method was equivalent to that of the intraperitoneal administration method. Furthermore, this method can be used for recombination before birth, or during the fetal period. We recommend researchers to employ this feeding method to administer tamoxifen to minimize the risk of injury to mice.",

The Food Craving Inventory (FCI) and the Control of Eating Questionnaire (COEQ) were administered over 12 weeks. The FCI total score and the subscale scores reduced from baseline in all groups. The least squares means (95% confidence intervals) for the total scores were \u22120.65 (\u22120.75, \u22120.55), \u22120.75 (\u22120.84, \u22120.65), and \u22120.84 (\u22120.95, \u22120.74) in the LOR BID, LOR BID+PHEN QD, and LOR BID+PHEN BID groups, respectively. Cravings assessed by COEQ reduced from baseline in all groups. In general, the combination treatments were more effective than lorcaserin alone. At week 12, except for fruit juice and dairy products, general and specific cravings reduced in LOR BID+PHEN BID compared to LOR BID (p<0.05). Lorcaserin in combination with phentermine improves control of food cravings during short-term energy restriction.",

    "abstract": "Women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are at high risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD); continuous life-style intervention, especially diet, is central to managing T2DM and CVD. However, little is known about the dietary patterns of women with GDM after delivery. The goal of this study was to compare the eating habits and food intakes of women diagnosed with GDM during the early postpartum period. We performed a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in 184 women with GDM between 6 and 12 weeks after delivery. Based on the results of the OGTT, the subjects were divided into three groups according to the American Diabetes Association criteria; normal glucose tolerance (NGT) ( n =100), pre-diabetes ( n =73), and diabetes mellitus (DM) ( n =11). Eating habits and usual food intake after delivery were investigated using a questionnaire, based on 24 hour-recall, which was administered by a trained dietitian. The daily intake data were analyzed using CAN Pro 3.0. Blood tests were performed pre- and post-delivery. Eating habits were not significantly different among the three groups. However, animal fat consumption was significantly different among the three groups. The intake ratio of fat calories to total calories was also significantly higher in the pre-diabetes and DM groups. Although diet in the period 6 to 12 weeks postpartum did not influence glucose level, it may be important to educate women with GDM about the risks of excessive animal fat intake during pregnancy and the postpartum period in order to prevent later onset of T2DM.",

The UPPS-P impulsivity model has been associated with substance addiction and gambling disorder, but its role in other non-substance addiction-related behaviors is less understood. We sought to examine associations between UPPS-P impulsivity traits and indicators of multiple substance and non-substance addiction-related behaviors in youth with varying involvement in these behaviors. Participants ( N =\u2009109, aged 16\u201326\u00a0years, 69% males) were selected from a national survey based on their level of externalizing problems to achieve a broad distribution of involvement in addiction-related behaviors. Participants completed the UPPS-P Questionnaire and standardized questionnaires assessing problematic use of substances (alcohol, cannabis, and other drugs) and non-substances (Internet gaming, pornography, and food). Regression analyses were used to assess associations between impulsivity traits and indicators of addiction-related behaviors. The UPPS-P model was positively associated with indicators of all addiction-related behaviors except problematic Internet gaming. In the fully adjusted models, sensation seeking and lack of perseverance were associated with problematic use of alcohol, urgency was associated with problematic use of cannabis, and lack of perseverance was associated with problematic use of other drugs than cannabis. Furthermore, urgency and lack of perseverance were associated with binge eating and lack of perseverance was associated with problematic use of pornography. We emphasize the role of trait impulsivity across multiple addiction-related behaviors. Our findings in at-risk youth highlight urgency and lack of perseverance as potential predictors for the development of addictions and as potential preventative therapeutic targets.",

Using a pig model, we investigated the effects of maternal body condition (thin or fat) and maternal gestation feeding level (restricted, control or high) on maternal stress, milk composition, litter size, piglet birth weight and pre-weaning growth. A total of sixty-eight thin (backfat depth about 8\u00a0mm) and seventy-two fat (backfat depth about 12\u00a0mm) gilts were selected at about 22 weeks. This backfat difference was then accentuated nutritionally up to service at about 32 weeks. During gestation, individual gilts from within each group were randomly allocated to a gestation diet at the following feed allowances: 1\u00b78\u00a0kg/d (restricted); 2\u00b75\u00a0kg/d (control) and 3\u00b75\u00a0kg/d (high) until day 90 of gestation. During gestation restricted gilts had higher levels of cortisol than high and control fed animals. Piglets born to fat gilts had higher average daily gain during the lactation period and higher weaning weights at day 28 than piglets born to thin gilts. Gilts on a high feed level had heavier piglets than those provided with restricted and control allocations. Fat gilts had less saturated fat in their milk at day 21 of lactation and higher unsaturated fat levels. No differences were found in the n -6: n -3 PUFA ratio in the milk between thin and fat gilts. In conclusion, maternal body condition influenced the daily weight gain of offspring up to weaning (day 28) and milk fat composition. Furthermore, maternal feed level during gestation alters maternal cortisol levels and milk fat composition.",

In order to develop care that facilitates initiation of breastfeeding and enables mothers to realize their expectations concerning breastfeeding, it is necessary to understand what having severe breastfeeding difficulties means for women who experience them. The aim of this study is to describe the lived experiences of initiating breastfeeding under severe difficulties. A reflective lifeworld research design was used. Eight women, seven primiparous and one multipara, were interviewed within 2 months of giving birth. The essential meaning of the phenomenon is described as \u201c Existential lostness as a mother forcing oneself into a constant fight \u201d. This pattern is further explicated through its constituents; shattered expectations, a lost time for closeness, being of no use to the infant, being forced to expose oneself, and gaining strength through sharing. The results show that mothers with severe breastfeeding difficulties feel alone and exposed because of their suffering and are lost in motherhood. Thus, adequate care for mothers should enhance the forming of a caring relationship through sharing rather than exposing.",

Pan roasting and microwave cooking caused a significantly higher production of COPs, as with the process of reheating using microwave, pan roasting, and oven grilling methods. The major COPs found in pork loin were cholestanetriol, 20-hydroxycholesterol, and 25-hydroxycholesterol, whose concentrations varied according to the different cooking and reheating methods used. Moreover, the aerobic storage of cooked pork loin under a refrigerated condition also increased the formation of cholesterol oxides on reheating.",

    "abstract": "Tube feeding is used for patients, who are not able to eat orally but their digestive system can digest food. This method is safe and economical for patients, maintains the functions of the digestive system and reduces the risk of infection and sepsis. However, incorrect administration of this method of feeding results in problems such as aspiration pneumonia, infection, diarrhea, NG tube obstruction, and etcetera. If tube feeding is performed according to its standard procedure, it can have a major role in reducing complications, providing adaptability and the desired lifestyle, reducing the duration of hospitalization, and reducing the relevant costs. This research is a descriptive-analytic cross-sectional study on 37 nurses who worked in the general surgery and neurology wards and fed patients suffering from gastrostomy. A valid and reliable checklist was used for data collection. To analyze the data, the descriptive statistical method (frequency and mean) and inferential method (paired t-test, Spearman Correlation Coefficient and variance Analysis with repetition of observations) were used. The findings showed that the mean score of measures in all the stages (before, during, and after administration) was significantly lower than the standard (p < 0.001). There was a significant reverse relation between the score of measures in all the three stages (before, during, and after administration), and work record and work experience in the ward. Furthermore, the mean score of measures in all the three stages was significantly different between female and male subjects (p value = 0.031), in that the mean score of women was higher than that of men. There was also a significant difference between the mean score of measures in all the three stages, and the employment status of samples; so that the mean score of provisionally employed personnel was higher than that of permanently employed personnel. The findings of the research showed that the mean score of measures before, during, and after administration of feeding through gastrostomy was lower than the standard (p < 0.001). Therefore, a gastroenterology advisor, a clinical nurse and a nutrition specialist should train the patients and their families, and the personnel about preparation and storage of food, method of administering food, protection of tube entrance and NG tube by considering the problems and complications arising from this type of feeding.

RLS symptoms are usually moderate to severe in intensity during pregnancy and can result in insomnia, depression, and other adverse outcomes. Although iron deficiency has been implicated as a potential etiological factor, other mechanisms can also play a role. Nonpharmacologic methods are the primary recommended form of treatment for RLS in pregnancy and lactation. Iron supplementation may be considered when the serum ferritin is low; however, several patients are unable to tolerate iron or have severe symptoms despite oral iron replacement. Here, we describe a case of severe RLS in pregnancy and illustrate the dilemmas in diagnosis and management. We review the literature on the prevalence, diagnosis, course, possible underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms and complications of RLS in pregnancy. We describe current best evidence on the efficacy, and safety of nonpharmacologic therapies, oral and intravenous iron supplementation, as well as other medication treatments for RLS in pregnancy and lactation. We highlight gaps in the literature and provide a practical guide for the clinical management of RLS in pregnancy and during breastfeeding.",

However, while self-weighing has been associated with weight loss, there is mixed evidence regarding the psychological impact of this behaviour. The present review aimed to quantify the relationship between self-weighing and: (i) affect (e.g., anxiety, depression); (ii) psychological functioning (e.g., self-esteem); (iii) body-related attitudes and (iv) disordered eating. A computerized search of scientific databases in September 2014 and subsequent ancestry and citation searches identified 29 independent tests of the relationship between self-weighing on psychological outcomes. Meta-analysis was used to quantify the size of the association across the tests. Results indicated that there was no association between self-weighing and affect, body-related attitudes or disordered eating. There was, however, a small-sized negative association between self-weighing and psychological functioning. The age of participants, obesity status, the extent of weight loss, duration of self-weighing and study design (RCT versus correlational) were found to influence at least some of the psychological outcomes of self-weighing. The findings suggest that, for the most part, self-weighing is not associated with adverse psychological outcomes. However, in some cases the association between self-weighing and psychological outcomes may be more negative than in others.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the current study was to examine the following hypotheses: 1. Mothers who breastfeed their infants from 2 to 12 months of age or who use a mixed-feeding method after birth will demonstrate greater attachment toward their infants than mothers who only formula-feed their infants, as measured by the Maternal Attachment Inventory (MAI). 2. A difference in maternal attachment levels will be observed between mothers who exclusively formula-feed their infants and those who exclusively breastfeed their infants from 2 to 12 months of age, as measured by the MAI inventory, controlling for infant temperament. A cross-sectional, descriptive, comparative method was applied in different healthcare centers in Jordan from May 2016 to August 2016 in which the MAI inventory was employed to assess 258 Arabic-speaking mothers. One-way analysis of variance was used to detect the differences in maternal attachment between mothers using different feeding methods. The findings showed significant differences in maternal attachment between exclusive breastfeeding and exclusive formula-feeding mothers, and mixed-feeding mothers at 2 months (F\u00a0=\u00a024.36, P\u00a0<\u00a0.01).

    "abstract": "A prematurely born infant had three episodes of feeding intolerance in the first three weeks after birth. In the post-partum period, his mother, who was from the Ukraine, had a respiratory arrest; unusually, a high-resolution computerised tomograph demonstrated miliary tuberculosis (TB). As a consequence, and due to the continuing ill health of the infant, gastric aspirates were sent from the infant. Acid fast bacilli were seen on microscopy. Variable nucleotide tandem repeat analysis of acid fast bacilli facilitated the rapid diagnosis of connatal TB. We conclude that connatal TB should be considered in a prematurely born infant poorly responsive to standard management and whose mother falls into a high-risk group.",

Eighty infants who had been seen at the Emergency Department for an episode of acute wheezing were followed for 2\u2003yr in this prospective study. Caregivers completed a questionnaire, and children underwent clinical evaluation and skin prick testing 2\u2003yr following the index\u2010wheezing episode. Detection of respiratory viruses and analysis of exposure to major indoor allergens were carried out at enrollment. Immunoglobin E antibodies were measured at the beginning of the study and at the end of follow\u2010up, using the CAP system. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with persistent wheezing. Seventy\u2010three children (44 boys) completed the study. After 2\u2003yr, 38 (52%) reported three or more wheezing episodes in the past 12\u2003months (persistent wheezers). Independent risk factors for persistence of wheezing were allergic sensitization and exposure to cockroach allergen in the kitchen. Breast\u2010feeding for at least 1\u2003month was a protective factor. A strong association between allergic sensitization and persistence of wheezing was found in a group of very young children living in a subtropical area.",

    "abstract": "Relapsing to overeating is a stubborn problem in obesity treatment. We tested the hypothesis that context cues surrounding palatable food (PF) intake have the power to disrupt caloric regulation even of less PF. Context cues are non-food cues that are in the environment where PF is habitually eaten. Rats were conditioned to associate intake of Oreo cookies as the PF to cages with distinct context cues that differed from cues in cages were they were only given chow. PF naturally stimulated greater caloric intake. The rats were then tested in the PF cage with only chow available to determine if the PF-paired cues, alone, could elicit overeating of plain chow. Non food-deprived female Sprague-Dawley rats. Intake of plain chow under PF-paired cues vs. chow-paired cues was compared. This was also measured in tests that included a morsel of PF as a priming stimulus. We also controlled for any effect of binge-prone vs. binge\u2013resistant status to predict cued-overeating. Rats consumed significantly more chow when exposed to context cues previously paired with PF than with chow (p<0.01). This effect occurred using various cues (e.g., different types of bedding or wallpaper). The effect was strengthened by priming with a morsel of PF (p<0.001) and was unaffected by baseline differences in propensity to binge on PF. Context-cues associated with PF intake can drive overeating even of a less PF and abolish the ability of rats to compensate for the calories of a PF primer. Just as drug-associated context cues can reinstate drug-addiction relapse, PF-paired cues may trigger overeating relapses linked to weight regain and obesity. This model should help identify the reflex-like biology that sabotages attempts to adhere to healthy reduced calorie regimens and call greater attention to the cue-factor in the treatment of binge-eating and obesity.",

    "abstract": "Many confirmed genetic loci for obesity are expressed in regions of the brain that regulate energy intake and reward-seeking behavior. Whether these loci contribute to the development of specific eating behaviors has not been investigated. We examined the relationship between a genetic susceptibility to obesity and cognitive restraint, uncontrolled and emotional eating. Eating behavior and body mass index (BMI) were determined by questionnaires for 1471 men and 2381 women from two U.S cohorts. Genotypes were extracted from genome-wide scans and a genetic-risk score (GRS) derived from 32 obesity-loci was calculated. The GRS was positively associated with emotional and uncontrolled eating( P <0.002). In exploratory analysis, BMI-increasing variants of MTCH2 , TNNI3K and ZC3H4 were positively associated with emotional eating and those of TNNI3K and ZC3H4 were positively associated with uncontrolled eating. The BMI-increasing variant of FTO was positively and those of LRP1B and TFAP2B were inversely associated with cognitive restraint. These associations for single SNPs were independent of BMI but were not significant after multiple-testing correction. An overall genetic susceptibility to obesity may also extend to eating behaviors. The link between specific loci and obesity may be mediated by eating behavior but larger studies are warranted to confirm these results.",

Furthermore, the bodily fats of transgenic proteins in the Japanese quails were investigated. The results showed that the parameters body weight, hematology, serum chemistry, relative organ weight, and histopathological appearance were normal in male and female quails that consumed GM diets, and no differences could be attributed to the varying diets in regard to the laying performances or nutrient egg compositions between the groups. Furthermore, the transgenic Cry1Ab and EPSPS proteins were undetectable by Western blot in the blood, organ, fecal, and whole egg samples of quails fed a diet containing GM maize. The results obtained after 49\u00a0d suggested that consumption of C0030.3.5 transgenic feed did not adversely affect quail health or egg quality, and there was no evidence of transgenic protein translocation to the blood, tissues, feces, and eggs. Based on the different parameters assessed, C0030.3.5 transgenic maize is a safe food source for quails that does not differ in quality from non-GM maize.",

To assess the incidence and reoccurrence of infections and allergic symptoms in the first years of life among 1,603 children from the EDEN mother\u2013child cohort, distinct longitudinal patterns of infectious diseases as well as skin rash and respiratory symptoms were identified by group\u2010based trajectory modelling. To characterize infections, we considered the parent\u2010reported number of cold/nasopharyngitis and diarrhoea from birth to 12 months and otitis and bronchitis/bronchiolitis from birth to 2 years. To characterize allergy\u2010related symptoms, we considered the parent\u2010reported occurrence of wheezing and skin rash from 8 months to 8 years and asthma from 2 to 8 years. Then associations between breastfeeding and these longitudinal patterns were assessed through adjusted multinomial logistic regression. Compared with never\u2010breastfed infants, ever\u2010breastfed infants were at a lower risk of diarrhoea events in early infancy as well as infrequent events of bronchitis/bronchiolitis throughout infancy. Only predominant breastfeeding duration was related to frequent events of bronchitis/bronchiolitis and infrequent events of otitis. We found no significant protective effect of breastfeeding on longitudinal patterns of cold/nasopharyngitis, skin rash, or respiratory symptoms. For an infant population with a short breastfeeding duration, on average, our study confirmed a protective effect of breastfeeding on diarrhoea events in early infancy, infrequent bronchitis/bronchiolitis and, to a lesser extent, infrequent otitis events up to 2 years but not on other infections, skin rash, or respiratory symptoms4.

Adolescent binge drinkers have reduced cerebellar activity during reward outcome. Average drinks consumed/drinking day was negatively related to brain activity. Salience of rewards may be blunted because of alcohol-induced neurotoxicity. Due to ongoing development, adolescence may be a period of heightened vulnerability to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol. Binge drinking may alter reward-driven behavior and neurocircuitry, thereby increasing risk for escalating alcohol use. Therefore, we compared reward processing in adolescents with and without a history of recent binge drinking. At their baseline study visit, all participants (age\u00a0=\u00a014.86\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.88) were free of heavy alcohol use and completed a modified version of the Wheel of Fortune (WOF) functional magnetic resonance imaging task. Following this visit, 17 youth reported binge drinking on \u22653 occasions within a 90 day period and were matched to 17 youth who remained alcohol and substance-na\u00efve. All participants repeated the WOF task during a second visit (age\u00a0=\u00a016.83\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.22). No significant effects were found in a region of interest analysis of the ventral striatum, but whole-brain analyses showed significant group differences in reward response at the second study visit in the left cerebellum, controlling for baseline visit brain activity ( p / \u03b1 <\u00a00.05), which was negatively correlated with mean number of drinks consumed/drinking day in the last 90 days. These findings suggest that binge drinking during adolescence may alter brain activity during reward processing in a dose-dependent manner.",

This process evaluation study documented and examined the implementation of an intervention strategy for young children. Methods: Complementary feeding of 6-month to 2-year-old children was implemented for 120 days by the municipalities of Plaridel and Pulilan in Bulacan, Philippines utilizing local-based food made of rice and mung bean along with nutrition education classes among mothers/caregivers using the developed nutrition modules. A total of 121 mother-/caregiver-child pairs were the program participants of the intervention. Pre-post design were used in the analysis of quantitative data. Qualitative data were encoded verbatim manually using emerging themes. Key informant interviews among community workers and municipal officials and focus group discussions among mothers/caregivers and community workers were conducted to gather the needed data. Results: The municipalities adhered to the program phases of planning, organizing, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. At end-line, the weight of children participants increased in both municipalities and the mean nutrition knowledge scores of mothers/caregivers increased significantly ( P < .05). Conclusions: This process evaluation confirmed that the proposed nutrition intervention strategy for young children can be implemented at the local level. The strong support and active cooperation of the local program implementers and mothers/caregivers and adherence to program requirements were the key factors in the efficient implementation of the intervention. For sustainability, the passing of local ordinance for the adoption of intervention and budget support for implementation of the intervention is recommended.",

Recent advancements in next-generation sequencing methods have revealed the link between dysbiosis (imbalance of the normal gut microbiota) and several diseases, as this imbalance can disrupt the symbiotic relationship between the host and associated microbes. Establishment of the gut microbiota starts in utero or just after birth, and its composition dramatically changes to an adult-like composition by 3\u2005years of age. Because dysbiosis during childhood may persist through adulthood, it is crucial to acquire a balanced gut microbiota in childhood. Therefore, current studies have focused on the factors affecting the infant gut microbiota. This review discusses recent findings, including those from our studies, on how various factors, including the delivery mode, feeding type, and administration of drugs, including antibiotics, can influence the infant gut microbiota.

Instead, they ought to embrace its origin, namely as a way to closeness between mother and infant.",

Therefore, we evaluated optimal storage and processing methods for human milk from a nutritional standpoint. Human milk samples were collected between June 2017 and February 2018. Also, data about maternal information were collected. Human milk was analyzed for macronutrients and caloric content. The samples were subdivided into groups for nutrient analysis. The control group (fresh milk) was not stored or processed. The other groups (9 groups) consisted of samples analyzed based on different storage temperatures (room temperature, refrigerated, frozen), defrosting methods (bottle warmer, room temperature thawing, microwave oven), and storage period (1 week, 1 month, 2 months) and compared with the control group. There was no statistically significant difference in the nutrient content of human milk among the collected samples. A significant change in the content of macronutrients in milk samples was observed under storage condition at different temperatures for 1 week with subsequent thawing with bottle warmer compared to fresh milk. Under storage at \u221220\u00b0C for 1 week with subsequent thawing with different defrosting methods, a significant change in the content of macronutrients in milk samples was observed compared to fresh milk. After storage at \u221220\u00b0C for different periods and thawing with a bottle warmer, a significant change in macronutrient content in milk samples was observed compared to fresh milk regardless of the storage period. Unlike previous guidelines, changes in macronutrient content in milk samples were observed regardless of the method of storing and thawing.

These results suggest that patients with AN may have difficulty inferring other people\u2019s intention and also monitoring and evaluating their own cognitive activities. Therefore, these features may explain some aspects of the pathology of AN.",

    "abstract": " Background: Obesity is a chronic disease that causes several medical and psychiatric complications. There are plenty of pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies for obesity treatment. Bariatric surgery is one of the most efficient nonpharmacological treatment for morbid obesity; however, several psychological factors affect the success of bariatric surgery. This study aims to evaluate personality characteristics and eating attitude relationship with the success of bariatric surgery.  Methods: This study was carried out on 75 patients with obesity who were candidates of bariatric surgery in the obesity clinic of Rasoul-e-Akram Hospital in Tehran. The patients were asked to fill the TCI and EAT-26 questionnaires before and after the surgery. Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS-23 applying T-test, Mann-Whitney tests and Pearson and Spearman's correlation coefficient. The significance level was set at 0.05.  Results: Seventy-five patients, including 13 men and 62 women, were assessed through this study. The mean of the BMI of the participants was 44.7 prior to the surgery and 30 after the operation. Personality characteristics and eating attitudes had no significant relationship with the success of bariatric surgery.  Conclusion: Although the eating attitude and personal characteristics of the bariatric surgery candidates before the surgery was not related to the outcome of the surgery, they should be considered in post-operational psychological assessments.",

    "abstract": "Childhood obesity has increased in recent decades in Korea. This study was designed to examine differences in the eating habits, physical activity (PA), nutrition knowledge, and self-efficacy of children by obesity status. Subjects were 5th-grade children from 70 elementary schools in 17 cities nationwide. Two-stage stratified cluster sampling was employed. Survey questionnaire included items related to general characteristics, eating habits, PA, nutrition knowledge and self-efficacy. Excluding incomplete responses, 3,531 data were analyzed using SPSS. Subjects were categorized into overweight\u00b7obesity (OW) and normal weight (NW) groups based on body mass index percentiles for age by sex. A total of 21.5% of subjects was overweight or obese. There were significant differences in gender, perceived stress, perception of body shape, body satisfaction, and interest in weight control between the OW and NW groups ( P < 0.001). With respect to eating habits, the OW group ate breakfast ( P < 0.05) and snacks ( P < 0.01) less frequently, ate bigger meals ( P < 0.001), and demonstrated less desirable behaviors during meals ( P <0.05 in boys) compared to the NW group. The OW group participated in less PA than the NW group, especially boys. OW boys spent less time walking during weekdays ( P < 0.05) or the weekend ( P < 0.001), spent more time being sedentary during weekdays or the weekend ( P < 0.001), and exercised a fewer number of days ( P < 0.01). For girls, the OW group spent more time being sedentary during the weekend ( P < 0.01) and exercised a fewer number of days by walking or bicycle riding ( P < 0.05) than the NW group. Nutrition knowledge was not significantly different between the OW and NW groups. Self-efficacy ( P < 0.01 in boys), especially PA self-efficacy ( P < 0.01), was significantly lower in the OW than NW group. This study revealed differences in eating habits, PA, and self-efficacy between OW and NW children. Obesity management programs for children need to focus on increasing self-efficacy, modifying eating habits, and increasing PA.",

The study was designed as a prospective, randomized, and controlled study. Infants born in our hospital with birth weight below 1500 g within a 1 year period were included in the study. The number of samples was determined by power analysis. Babies were randomized according to birth weight and fed with intermittent bolus feeding and continuous feeding models. Demographic characteristics, clinical findings, diagnosis, nutritional status, and length of hospital stay were compared. The study was conducted with 80 preterm infants, which consisted of continuous feeding (n=41) and intermittent bolus feeding (n=39). There was no significant difference in gender, gestational week, birth weight, height, and head circumference distribution of the babies between groups. The difference between the reach time to birth weight and maximum weight loss rates, parenteral feeding time, transition time to full enteral feeding, transition time to oral feeding, development of feeding intolerance, mechanical ventilation time, and hospitalization time in intensive care unit were not statistically significant. Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) Stage I and II developed in 34.1% of babies fed with continuous feeding model and 28.2% of babies fed intermittently; NEC was detected to start in 4.5\u00b12.8 days in the continuous feeding group and in 2.8\u00b15.2 days in the intermittent group. These differences were found to be insignificant between the two groups (p=0.634 and p=0.266, respectively). There was no difference between growth parameters and discharge time of preterm babies who were applied continuous and intermittent bolus feeding model. Although there was no statistically significant difference on the development of NEC, it was determined that NEC developed earlier in the intermittent bolus feeding model.",

This study aims to develop breastfeeding evaluation indicators system in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) and to provide theoretical basis for all-round evaluation of breast feeding quality for hospitalized preterm infants. This study was performed based on Avedis Donabedian\u2019s theory of medical care quality. Preterm infant breast feeding evaluation indicators system frame was initially formed by using literature review, clinical on-spot observation and expert consultation methods. By using specialists meeting method and Delphi method, evaluation indicators system for preterm infants breastfeeding was verified and established. Breastfeeding evaluation indicators system were performed in NICU of hospitals in Binzhou and Shanghai. Feasibility and usability of indicators system were examined. Breastfeeding evaluation indicators system for preterm infants comprise 3 levels, including level 1 (3 indicators), level 2 (7 indicators), and level 3 (18 indicators). Recognition rates of importance for level 2 and 3 range from 94.4% to 100.0% and 80.6% to 100.0%, respectively. Mean of Likert rating for level 2 and 3 range from 3.31 to 3.89 and 3.03 to 3.97, which are all higher than the average value of 2.50. Kendall\u2019s coefficient and its significance test showed that consistency of experts\u2019 opinion for indicators\u2019 importance is high (P<0.001). This strategy of combining qualitative and quantitative methods could be used in overall evaluation of the breastfeeding quality in NICUs. Indicators system is feasible and is a promising evaluation tool for continuously improving breastfeeding quality for preterm infants in NICUs.",

By using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we determined the patterns of hypothalamic activation after oral intake in anorexic (A), non\u2010anorexic (NA) cancer patients, and in controls (C). Lung cancer patients were considered. Hypothalamic activation was recorded in A and NA patients and in C by fMRI, before (T0), immediately after (T1) the administration of an oral nutritional supplement, and after 15\u2009min (T2). The grey of the hypothalamus and Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) intensity were calculated and normalized for basal conditions. Interleukin (IL)\u20101, IL\u20106, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)\u2010\u03b1, ghrelin, and leptin plasma levels were measured. A statistical parametric mapping was used. Thirteen lung cancer patients (7\u2009M, 6\u2009F; 9A, 4NA) and 2 C (1\u2009M, 1\u2009F) were enrolled. Controls had the lowest BOLD intensity.

Anorexic patients showed greater BOLD signal reduction during T0\u2013T1 than NA (\u22128.5% vs. \u22126.80%, P <\u20090.001). Independently from the presence of anorexia, BOLD signals modification before and after oral challenge correlated with basal values of IL\u20101 and ghrelin ( P <\u20090.001). Hypothalamic activity in A cancer patients is reduced respect to NA and responds differently to oral challenges. This suggests a central control of appetite dysregulation during cancer anorexia, before, and after oral intake.",

Cases and controls were interviewed by trained study interviewers, using a standardized, structured questionnaire, to obtain information on lactation and other major risk factors. Parous women who reported ever lactation had a borderline significantly reduced risk of breast cancer (OR = 0.83, 95% CI, 0.63\u20131.09). An OR of 0.53 (95% CI, 0.27\u20131.04) was observed in those having breastfed more than 3 children compared to those who never lactated. Women having breastfed their first child for more than 13 months had an OR of 0.47 (95% CI, 0.23\u20130.94) compared to those who never breastfed. Lifetime duration of lactation also showed a risk reduction while none of the ORs were statistically significant. Further stratification by menopausal status showed a risk reduction related to lactation for both pre- and postmenopausal women, while the relationship is less consistent for the latter.

The simulation results by CTM show that the increments of annual heating and cooling may differ up to 10s of times or even more than 100 times in different cities for the same building with the same increase of ventilation rates, while the annual heating and cooling RVRs are both approximate in different cities. For the same building with the same increase of ventilation rate in the same city, its annual heating RVRs are far higher than its annual cooling RVRs. The above conclusion can be reached for any building whether with various envelopes or with different shape coefficients.",

The governing mathematical model was expressed in terms of closed form solution expressions. Attention has been focused to the analysis of temperature and concentration distributions. The graphical results are presented to visualize the impact of sundry quantities on temperature and concentration. It is visualized that the liquid temperature was enhanced with the enhancing values of Soret-Dufour parameters. The liquid temperature was reduced when the values of Biot number were larger. It is also examined that mass transfer Biot number for one wall has no impact on transfer rate. Different mass transfer Biot numbers generate a non-uniform concentration profile throughout the channel cross section.",

The World Health Organization recommends immediate, uninterrupted, and continuous mother\u2013newborn skin-to-skin care practice almost immediately after birth. Despite this recommendation, separation of the newborn from the mother is common in many public health institutions. There was a limited study that examined the prevalence of skin-to-skin care practice and associated factors in Ethiopia. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of skin-to-skin care practice and its associated factors among postpartum mothers in Gurage Zone public health centers, Southern Ethiopia, 2020. An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted in twenty-two public health centers of Gurage Zone from January 1st up to 30th, 2020. A total of 382 postpartum mothers were selected using a systematic sampling technique. Data were collected using structured and pre-tested interviewer-administered questionnaires. Data were entered into EpiData version 3.1.0 and exported to SPSS version 23 for analysis. Both bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify significant factors associated with skin-to-skin care practice. Statistical significance was declared at a P-value of <0.05 with a 95% confidence level. About 35.3% (95% CI; 31.3%\u201340.4%) of new-borns were received skin-to-skin care practice. Being urban residence [AOR=2.23, (95% CI; 1.17\u20134.23)], normal newborn birth weight (\u22652500gm) [AOR=3.1, (95% CI; 2.15\u20133.89)], early initiation of breastfeeding [AOR=2.93, (95% CI; 1.29\u20136.64)], colostrum feeding [AOR=4.19, (95% CI; 2.01\u20138.73)], and having mothers good knowledge on skin-to-skin care practice [AOR=8.51, (95% CI; 4.32\u201316.75)] were some of factors associated with mother to newborn skin-to-skin care practice. The proportion of mother newborn skin-to-skin care practice was low in the study area. Mothers resided in the urban areas, normal newborn birth weight, early initiation of breastfeeding, colostrum feeding, and having good knowledge of the mothers about skin-to-skin care were factors associated with skin-to-skin care practice. Therefore, health care workers should counsel mothers on optimal breastfeeding practice and enhance maternal awareness regarding the merits of skin-to-skin care practice before discharge from the health facilities are recommended.",

Working memory functioning predicts the initiating of (binge) drinking in adolescents. Response inhibition predicts the initiating of drinking, but not binge drinking in adolescents. Weakness in executive functioning precedes drinking behavior of adolescents. Recently, it has been suggested that impairments in executive functioning might be risk factors for the onset of alcohol use rather than a result of heavy alcohol use. In the present study, we examined whether two aspects of executive functioning, working memory and response inhibition, predicted the first alcoholic drink and first binge drinking episode in young adolescents using discrete survival analyses. Adolescents were selected from several Dutch secondary schools including both mainstream and special education (externalizing behavioral problems). Participants were 534 adolescents between 12 and 14 years at baseline. Executive functioning and alcohol use were assessed four times over a period of two years. Working memory uniquely predicted the onset of first drink ( p =\u00a0.01) and first binge drinking episode ( p =\u00a0.04) while response inhibition only uniquely predicted the initiating of the first drink ( p =\u00a0.01). These results suggest that the association of executive functioning and alcohol consumption found in former studies cannot simply be interpreted as an effect of alcohol consumption, as weaknesses in executive functioning, found in alcohol na\u00efve adolescents, predict the initiating of (binge) drinking. Though, prolonged and heavy alcohol use might further weaken already existing deficiencies.",

Herein, we investigated the therapeutic effects of LGD using the activity-based anorexia (ABA) in a mouse model. Six-week-old female BALB/c AnNCrl mice were orally administered LGD, water, licorice decoction, dried ginger decoction, or chronic olanzapine, and their survival, body weight, food intake, and wheel activity were compared in ABA. Additionally, dopamine concentration in brain tissues was evaluated. LGD significantly reduced the number of ABA mice reaching the drop-out criterion of fatal body weight loss. However, LGD showed no significant effects on food intake and wheel activity. We found that in the LGD group the rise of the light phase activity rate inhibited body weight loss. Licorice or dried ginger alone did not improve survival rates, they only showed longer survival periods than chronic olanzapine when combined. In addition, LGD increased the dopamine concentration in the brain. The results from the present study showed that LGD improves the survival of ABA mice and its mechanism of action might be related to the alteration of dopamine concentration in the brain.",

    "abstract": "Anorexia or decreased appetite is a common feature of infection. The effects of acute nutritional stress on effector T cells, which are required for pathogen-specific responses and protective immunological memory, are not fully understood. We show that reduced food intake during infection decreases the numbers of effector T cells in a manner dependent on the Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR). FXR was previously implicated in controlling hepatic responses to fasting. Our findings suggest that FXR functions in effector T cells to promote coherent physiological responses to decreased feeding, allowing organisms to scale their immune responses according to food availability. Reduced nutrient intake is a widely conserved manifestation of sickness behavior with poorly characterized effects on adaptive immune responses. During infectious challenges, naive T cells encountering their cognate antigen become activated and differentiate into highly proliferative effector T cells. Despite their evident metabolic shift upon activation, it remains unclear how effector T cells respond to changes in nutrient availability in vivo. Here, we show that spontaneous or imposed feeding reduction during infection decreases the numbers of splenic lymphocytes. Effector T cells showed cell-intrinsic responses dependent on the nuclear receptor Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR). Deletion of FXR in T cells prevented starvation-induced loss of lymphocytes and increased effector T cell fitness in nutrient-limiting conditions, but imparted greater weight loss to the host. FXR deficiency increased the contribution of glutamine and fatty acids toward respiration and enhanced cell survival under low-glucose conditions. Provision of glucose during anorexia of infection rescued effector T cells, suggesting that this sugar is a limiting nutrient for activated lymphocytes and that alternative fuel usage may affect cell survival in starved animals. Altogether, we identified a mechanism by which the host scales immune responses according to food intake, featuring FXR as a T cell-intrinsic sensor.",

    "abstract": "Reward sensitivity has been proposed as a potential mediator of outcomes for bariatric surgery. We aimed to determine whether gustatory and psychometric measures of reward-related feeding are predictors of bariatric-induced weight loss. A multicenter longitudinal cohort study was conducted in patients scheduled for bariatric surgery (surgical group), assessed at baseline and 2 follow-up assessments. Predictions of % weight loss from baseline (%WL) according to baseline gustatory measures, including intensity and pleasantness ratings of sweet and other tastants, and psychometric measures of reward-related feeding behavior, including hedonic hunger scores, were assessed with multivariable linear regression. Exploratory analyses were conducted to test for associations between %WL and changes in gustatory and psychophysical measures, as well as for comparisons with data from patients on the surgery waiting list (control group). We included 212 patients, of whom 96 in the surgical group and 50 in the control group were prospectively assessed. The groups were similar at baseline and, as expected, bariatric surgery resulted in higher %WL (B Treatment-Time =\u00a02.4; 95% CI: 2.1\u20132.8; P <\u00a00.0001). While variation in gustatory measures did not differ between groups, in the surgery group baseline sweet intensity predicted %WL at the primary endpoint (11 to 18 months postoperatively; \u03b2 = 0.2; B = 0.2, 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.3; P =\u00a00.02), as did hedonic hunger scores (\u03b2 = \u22120.2; B = \u22122.0, 95% CI: \u22123.8 to \u22120.3; P =\u00a00.02). Furthermore, at this endpoint, postsurgical reduction of sweet taste intensity and acceptance of sweet foods were associated with %WL (\u03b2 = \u22120.3; B = \u22123.5, 95% CI: \u22125.8 to \u22121.3; P =\u00a00.003, and \u03b2 = \u22120.2; B = \u22124.7, 95% CI: \u22128.5 to \u22120.8; P =\u00a00.02, respectively). The use of sweet intensity as a predictor of weight change was confirmed in another bariatric cohort. Sweet intensity ratings and hedonic hunger scores predict %WL after surgery. The variability of sweet intensity ratings is also associated with %WL, further suggesting they may reflect physiological processes that are variably modulated by bariatric surgery, influencing clinical outcomes.",
