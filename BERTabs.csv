However, the range and peak ages at onset for mental disorders are not fully established. To provide robust, global epidemiological estimates of age at onset for mental disorders, we conducted a PRISMA/MOOSE-compliant systematic review with meta-analysis of birth cohort/cross-sectional/cohort studies, representative of the general population, reporting age at onset for any ICD/DSM-mental disorders, identified in PubMed/Web of Science (up to 16/05/2020) (PROSPERO:CRD42019143015). Co-primary outcomes were the proportion of individuals with onset of mental disorders before age 14, 18, 25, and peak age at onset, for any mental disorder and across International Classification of Diseases 11 diagnostic blocks. Median age at onset of specific disorders was additionally investigated. Across 192 studies (n = 708,561) included, the proportion of individuals with onset of any mental disorders before the ages of 14, 18, 25 were 34.6%, 48.4%, 62.5%, and peak age was 14.5 years (k = 14, median = 18, interquartile range (IQR) = 11-34). For diagnostic blocks, the proportion of individuals with onset of disorder before the age of 14, 18, 25 and peak age were as follows: neurodevelopmental disorders: 61.5%, 83.2%, 95.8%, 5.5 years (k = 21, median=12, IQR = 7-16), anxiety/fear-related disorders: 38.1%, 51.8%, 73.3%, 5.5 years (k = 73, median = 17, IQR = 9-25), obsessive-compulsive/related disorders: 24.6%, 45.1%, 64.0%, 14.5 years (k = 20, median = 19, IQR = 14-29), feeding/eating disorders/problems: 15.8%, 48.1%, 82.4%, 15.5 years (k = 11, median = 18, IQR = 15-23), conditions specifically associated with stress disorders: 16.9%, 27.6%, 43.1%, 15.5 years (k = 16, median = 30, IQR = 17-48), substance use disorders/addictive behaviours: 2.9%, 15.2%, 48.8%, 19.5 years (k = 58, median = 25, IQR = 20-41), schizophrenia-spectrum disorders/primary psychotic states: 3%, 12.3%, 47.8%, 20.5 years (k = 36, median = 25, IQR = 20-34), personality disorders/related traits: 1.9%, 9.6%, 47.7%, 20.5 years (k = 6, median = 25, IQR = 20-33), and mood disorders: 2.5%, 11.5%, 34.5%, 20.5 years (k = 79, median = 31, IQR = 21-46). No significant difference emerged by sex, or definition of age of onset. Median age at onset for specific mental disorders mapped on a time continuum, from phobias/separation anxiety/autism spectrum disorder/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder/social anxiety (8-13 years) to anorexia nervosa/bulimia nervosa/obsessive-compulsive/binge eating/cannabis use disorders (17-22 years), followed by schizophrenia, personality, panic and alcohol use disorders (25-27 years), and finally post-traumatic/depressive/generalized anxiety/bipolar/acute and transient psychotic disorders (30-35 years), with overlap among groups and no significant clustering.

Disentangling binge eating disorder and food addiction: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,di Giacomo E; Aliberti F; Pescatore F; Santorelli M; Pessina R; Placenti V; Colmegna F; Clerici M,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The concept of ""Food Addiction"" has been based on criteria of Substance Use Disorder. Several studies suggested a relationship between food addiction and eating disorders, but little is known about its extent or role. We aim at exploring if food addiction is coincident with a specific eating disorder (binge eating disorder appears the closest) or it is a separate diagnostic entity that afflicts in comorbidity with eating disorders or other conditions like obesity or even in the general population. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis analyzed observational studies with a comparative estimation on rates of subjects affected by binge eating disorder and food addiction. RESULTS: Binge eating disorder shows higher comorbidity with food addiction compared to other eating disorders (OR = 1.33, 95% CI, 0.64-2.76; c(2) = 4.42; p = 0.44;I(2) = 0%), or each eating disorder [anorexia nervosa purging type (OR = 1.93, 95% CI, 0.20-18.92; p = 0.57) and restrictive type (OR = 8.75, 95% CI, 1.08-70.70; p = 0.04)], obese patients (OR = 5.72, 95% CI, 3.25-10.09; p =  < 0.0001) and individuals from the general population (OR = 55.41, 95% CI, 8.16-376.10; c(2) = 18.50; p < 0.0001; I(2) = 0%)but has decreased prevalence when compared to bulimia nervosa (OR = 0.85, 95% CI, 0.33-2.22; c(2) = 0.35; p = 0.74; I(2) = 0%). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that the prevalence of food addiction in binge eating disorder is higher than in other eating disorders except in bulimia nervosa. Moreover, it is a separate diagnostic reality and can be detected in people without mental illness and in the general population. Food addiction might have a prognostic value, since in comorbidity, and should be addressed to boost treatment efficacy and patient's recovery.

Medical cannabinoids: a pharmacology-based systematic review and meta-analysis for all relevant medical indications.,Bilbao A; Spanagel R,"BACKGROUND: Medical cannabinoids differ in their pharmacology and may have different treatment effects. We aimed to conduct a pharmacology-based systematic review (SR) and meta-analyses of medical cannabinoids for efficacy, retention and adverse events. METHODS: We systematically reviewed (registered at PROSPERO: CRD42021229932) eight databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of dronabinol, nabilone, cannabidiol and nabiximols for chronic pain, spasticity, nausea /vomiting, appetite, ALS, irritable bowel syndrome, MS, Chorea Huntington, epilepsy, dystonia, Parkinsonism, glaucoma, ADHD, anorexia nervosa, anxiety, dementia, depression, schizophrenia, PTSD, sleeping disorders, SUD and Tourette. Main outcomes and measures included patient-relevant/disease-specific outcomes, retention and adverse events. Data were calculated as standardized mean difference (SMD) and ORs with confidence intervals (CI) via random effects. Evidence quality was assessed by the Cochrane Risk of Bias and GRADE tools. RESULTS: In total, 152 RCTs (12,123 participants) were analysed according to the type of the cannabinoid, outcome and comparator used, resulting in 84 comparisons. Significant therapeutic effects of medical cannabinoids show a large variability in the grade of evidence that depends on the type of cannabinoid. CBD has a significant therapeutic effect for epilepsy (SMD - 0.5[CI - 0.62, - 0.38] high grade) and Parkinsonism (- 0.41[CI - 0.75, - 0.08] moderate grade). There is moderate evidence for dronabinol for chronic pain (- 0.31[CI - 0.46, - 0.15]), appetite (- 0.51[CI - 0.87, - 0.15]) and Tourette (- 1.01[CI - 1.58, - 0.44]) and moderate evidence for nabiximols on chronic pain (- 0.25[- 0.37, - 0.14]), spasticity (- 0.36[CI - 0.54, - 0.19]), sleep (- 0.24[CI - 0.35, - 0.14]) and SUDs (- 0.48[CI - 0.92, - 0.04]). All other significant therapeutic effects have either low, very low, or even no grade of evidence. Cannabinoids produce different adverse events, and there is low to moderate grade of evidence for this conclusion depending on the type of cannabinoid. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabinoids are effective therapeutics for several medical indications if their specific pharmacological properties are considered. We suggest that future systematic studies in the cannabinoid field should be based upon their specific pharmacology.",2022,Aug,BMC Med,20,1,259,,10.1186/s12916-022-02459-1,35982439,#6,Bilbao 2022,Sasha Gorrell (2025-07-09 01:22:06)(Select): pooled results from 2 AN studies; ,Pharmacotherapy,
Prevalence of co-occurring conditions in children and adults with autism spectrum disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Micai M; Fatta LM; Gila L; Caruso A; Salvitti T; Fulceri F; Ciaramella A; D'Amico R; Del Giovane C; Bertelli M; Romano G; Schünemann HJ; Scattoni ML,"This systematic review estimates the prevalence of co-occurring conditions (CCs) in children and adults with autism. A comprehensive search strategy consulting existing guidelines, diagnostic manuals, experts, carers, and autistic people was developed. PubMed and PsycInfo databases from inception to May 2022 were searched. PROSPERO registration: CRD42019132347. Two blind authors screened and extracted the data. Prevalence estimates for different CCs were summarized by using random effects models. Subgroup analyses were performed for age groups (children/adolescents vs adults) and study designs (population/registry-based vs clinical sample-based).

Psychopharmacology of eating disorders: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,Fornaro M; Mondin AM; Billeci M; Fusco A; De Prisco M; Caiazza C; Micanti F; Calati R; Carvalho AF; de Bartolomeis A,"BACKGROUND: The concurrent assessment of weight and affective psychopathology outcomes relevant to the psychopharmacology of major eating disorders (EDs), namely anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge eating disorder (BED), warrants systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). METHODS: PubMed, Scopus, and ClinicalTrials.gov were inquired from inception through August 31st, 2022, for RCTs documenting any psychopharmacological intervention for EDs diagnosed according to validated criteria and reporting weight and psychopathology changes. Adopted keywords were: ""anorexia nervosa,"" ""bulimia nervosa,"" ""binge eating disorder,"" ""antidepressant,"" ""antipsychotic,"" and ""mood stabilizer."" No language restriction applied. RESULTS: 5122 records were identified, and 203 full-texts were reviewed. Sixty-two studies entered the qualitative synthesis (AN = 22, BN = 23, BED = 17), of which 22 entered the meta-analysis (AN = 9, BN = 10, BED = 3). Concerning BMI increase in AN, olanzapine outperformed placebo (Hedges'g = 0.283, 95%C·I. = 0.051-0.515, I(2) = 0 %; p = .017), whereas fluoxetine failed (Hedges'g = 0.351, 95%C.I. = -0.248 to 0.95, I(2) = 63.37 %; p = .251). Fluoxetine not significantly changed weight (Hedges'g = 0.147, 95%C.I. = -0.157-0.451, I(2) = 0 %; p = .343), reducing binging (Hedges'g = 0.203, 95%C.I. = 0.007-0.399, I(2) = 0 %; p = .042), and purging episodes (Hedges'g = 0.328, 95%C.I. = -0.061-0.717, I(2) = 58.97 %; p = .099) in BN.

An update on the prevalence of eating disorders in the general population: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Qian J; Wu Y; Liu F; Zhu Y; Jin H; Zhang H; Wan Y; Li C; Yu D,"OBJECTIVE: To update the prevalence of eating disorders in the general population before 2021 and to analyze the distribution characteristics at different times and in different regions and sexes, as well as the diagnostic criteria. METHODS: Based on the method from a previous report by the authors, studies were identified from the following databases: PubMed/Medline, PsycINFO, ISI Web of Knowledge, Ovid and the 4 most important Chinese databases. Articles in English and Chinese before 2021 were retrieved. The data retrieved at this time were pooled with the data from a previous report for analyses. RESULTS: Thirty-three studies were identified, which included 18 studies supplemented in this retrieval. The pooled lifetime and 12-month prevalence of eating disorders were 0.91% (95% CI, 0.48-1.71) and 0.43% (95% CI, 0.18-0.78), respectively. The pooled lifetime and 12-month prevalence of the subgroup EDs (any), which covers all types of eating disorders, were 1.69% and 0.72%, respectively. The lifetime prevalence of AN, BN and BED was 0.16% (95% CI, 0.06-0.31), 0.63% (95% CI, 0.33-1.02) and 1.53% (95% CI, 1.00-2.17), respectively. The lifetime prevalence of EDs in Western countries was 1.89%, and was high at 2.58% in females. Prevalence studies using DSM-5 criteria were scarce. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of eating disorders might be underestimated thus far. Not all types of EDs were included in a majority of epidemiological surveys, and the prevalence rates of the new types of EDs were significantly higher. Eating disorders were especially common in Western countries and in females. New diagnostic criteria should be used to comprehensively assess all types of eating disorders.

Eating Disorders and Dental Erosion: A Systematic Review.,Nijakowski K; Jankowski J; Gruszczyński D; Surdacka A,"Both eating disorders and dental erosion are increasingly affecting adolescents and young adults. Thus, our systematic review was designed to answer the question: ""Is there a relationship between dental erosion and eating disorders?"" Following the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 31 studies were included in this systematic review (according to the PRISMA statement guidelines). Based on the meta-analysis, 54.4% of patients with bulimia nervosa and 26.7% with anorexia nervosa experienced tooth erosion. For the whole group of 1699 patients with eating disorders, erosive lesions were observed in 42.1% of patients. Bulimics were more than 10 times more likely to experience dental erosion compared to healthy individuals (OR = 10.383 [95%CI: 4.882-22.086]). Similarly, more than 16 times increased odds of tooth erosion were found in patients with self-induced vomiting (OR = 16.176 [95%CI: 1.438-181.918]). In conclusion, eating disorders are associated with an increased risk of developing erosive lesions, especially in patients with bulimia nervosa.",2023,Sep,J Clin Med,12,19,,,10.3390/jcm12196161,37834805,#15,Nijakowski 2023,,Medical complications,
Efficacy of pharmacotherapies for bulimia nervosa: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Yu S; Zhang Y; Shen C; Shao F,"OBJECTIVE: The main purpose was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of different medications used to treat bulimia nervosa (BN). METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified from published sources through searches in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Embase from inception to November 2022. Primary outcomes were changes in the frequency of binge eating episodes and vomiting episodes from baseline to endpoint. Secondary outcomes were differences in the improvement of scores in depressive symptoms, tolerability (dropout due to adverse events) and weight change. RESULTS: The literature search ultimately included 11 drugs, 33 studies and 6 types of drugs, 8 trials with TCAs (imipramine, desipramine), 14 with SSRIs (fluoxetine, citalopram and fluvoxamine), 6 with MAOIs (phenelzine, moclobemide and brofaromine), 3 with antiepileptic drugs (topiramate), 1 with mood stabilizers (lithium), and 1 with amphetamine-type appetite suppressant (fenfluramine). The reduction in binge eating episodes was more likely due to these drugs than the placebo, and the SMD was -0.4 (95% CI -0.61 ~ -0.19); the changes in the frequency of vomiting episodes (SMD = -0.16, 95% CI -0.3 ~ -0.03); weight (WMD = -3.05, 95% CI -5.97 ~ -0.13); and depressive symptoms (SMD = -0.32, 95% CI -0.51 ~ -0.13). However, no significant difference was found in dropout due to adverse events (RR = 1.66, 95% CI 1.14 ~ 2.41). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis indicates that most pharmacotherapies decreased the frequency of binge-eating and vomiting episodes, body weight, and depressive symptoms in BN patients, but the efficacy was not significant. In each drug the efficacy is different, treating different aspects, different symptoms to improve the clinical performance of bulimia nervosa.",2023,Dec,BMC Pharmacol Toxicol,24,1,72,,10.1186/s40360-023-00713-7,38042827,#16,Yu 2023,,Bulimia; Pharmacotherapy,
Prevention of eating disorders at universities: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Harrer M; Adam SH; Messner EM; Baumeister H; Cuijpers P; Bruffaerts R; Auerbach RP; Kessler RC; Jacobi C; Taylor CB; Ebert DD,"BACKGROUND: Eating problems are highly prevalent among young adults. Universities could be an optimal setting to prevent the onset of eating disorders through psychological intervention. As part of the World Mental Health-International College Student initiative, this systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes data on the efficacy of eating disorder prevention programs targeting university students. METHOD: A systematic literature search of bibliographical databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO) for randomized trials comparing psychological preventive interventions for eating disorders targeting university students with psychoeducation or inactive controls was performed on October 22, 2019. RESULTS: Twenty-seven studies were included. Thirteen (48.1%) were rated to have a low risk of bias. The relative risk of developing a subthreshold or full-blown eating disorder was incidence rate ratio = 0.62 (95% CI [0.44, 0.87], n (c) = 8, numbers-needed-to-treat [NNT] = 26.08; standardized clinical interviews only), indicating a 38% decrease in incidence in the intervention groups compared to controls. Small to moderate between-group effects at posttest were found on eating disorder symptoms (g = 0.35, 95% CI [0.24, 0.46], NNT = 5.10, n (c) = 26), dieting (g = 0.43, 95% CI [0.29, 0.57], NNT = 4.17, n (c) = 21), body dissatisfaction (g = 0.40, 95% CI [0.27, 0.53], NNT = 4.48, n (c) = 25), drive for thinness (g = 0.43, 95% CI [0.27, 0.59], NNT = 4.23, n (c) = 12), weight concerns (g = 0.33, 95% CI [0.10, 0.57], NNT = 5.35, n (c) = 13), and affective symptoms (g = 0.27, 95% CI [0.15, 0.38], NNT = 6.70, n (c) = 18). The effects on bulimia nervosa symptoms were not significant. Heterogeneity was moderate across comparisons. DISCUSSION: Eating disorder prevention on campus can have significant, small-to-moderate effects on eating disorder symptoms and risk factors. Results also suggest that the prevention of subthreshold and full-syndrome eating disorders is feasible using such interventions. More research is needed to identify ways to motivate students to use preventive eating disorder interventions. ANTECEDENTES: Los trastornos de la conducta alimentaria son altamente prevalentes entre los adultos jóvenes. Las universidades podrían ser un entorno óptimo para prevenir la aparición de trastornos alimentarios a través de la intervención psicológica. Como parte de la iniciativa World Mental Health-International College Student, esta revisión sistemática y meta-análisis sintetiza datos sobre la eficacia de los programas de prevención de trastornos alimentarios dirigidos a estudiantes universitarios. MÉTODO: Una búsqueda bibliográfica sistemática de datos bibliográficas (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO) para ensayos aleatorios que comparaban intervenciones preventivas psicológicas para trastornos alimentarios dirigidos a estudiantes universitarios con psicoeducación o controles inactivos fue realizada hasta el 22 de octubre de 2019. RESULTADOS: Se incluyeron 27 estudios. Trece (48,1%) fueron calificados como de bajo riesgo de sesgo. El riesgo relativo de desarrollar un trastorno de la conducta alimentaria subclínico (parcial) o completo fue IRR = 0.62 (95% CI [0.44, 0.87], n(c) = 8, NNT = 26.08; sólo entrevistas clínicas estandarizadas), lo que indica una disminución del 38% en la incidencia en los grupos de intervención en comparación con los controles. Se encontraron efectos pequeños a moderados entre los grupos en la post-prueba en los síntomas del trastorno alimentario (g = 0.35, 95% CI [0.24, 0.46], NNT = 5.10, n(c) = 26), dieta (g = 0.43, 95% CI [0.29, 0.57], NNT = 4.17, n(c) = 21), insatisfacción corporal (g = 0.40, 95% CI [0.27, 0.53], NNT = 4.48, n(c) = 25), impulso por delgadez (g = 0.43, 95% CI [0.27, 0.59], NNT = 4.23, n(c) = 12), problemas de peso (g = 0.33, 95% CI [0.10, 0.57], NNT = 5.35, n(c) = 13) y síntomas afectivos (g = 0.27, 95% CI [0.15, 0.38], NNT = 6.70, n(c) = 18). Los efectos sobre los síntomas de la bulimia nervosa no fueron significativos. La heterogeneidad fue moderada en las comparaciones. DISCUSIÓN: La prevención de los trastornos de la conducta alimentaria en el campus universitario puede tener efectos significativos, de pequeños a moderados, sobre los síntomas del trastorno alimentario y los factores de riesgo.

Effectiveness of olanzapine in the treatment of anorexia nervosa: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Han R; Bian Q; Chen H,"OBJECTIVE: Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe psychiatric disorder characterized by starvation and malnutrition, a high incidence of coexisting psychiatric conditions, and treatment resistance. The effect of pharmacotherapy has been controversial. METHOD: A systematic review was conducted for evidence of an effect of olanzapine versus placebo in adults or its effect as adjuvant treatment of AN in adolescents. RESULTS: A total of seven articles (304 patients with AN) were identified. There were four double-blind, randomized studies examining the effect of olanzapine in the treatment of AN. The mean difference in body mass index (BMI) at the end of treatment between olanzapine and placebo was 0.67 kg/m(2) (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15-1.18 kg/m(2) ; p = 0.01; I(2)  = 0%, p for heterogeneity < 0.79). The olanzapine groups showed a significant increase in BMI of 0.68 kg/m(2) (95% CI 0.22-1.13 kg/m(2) ; p < 0.001; I(2)  = 0%, p for heterogeneity = 0.74) compared to the placebo groups. Only two studies examined the effect of olanzapine as adjuvant treatment in adolescents and showed an increase in BMI of 0.66 kg/m(2) (95% CI -0.36 to 1.67 kg/m(2) ; p = 0.21; I(2)  = 11%, p for heterogeneity = 0.32).

The Follow-Up of Eating Disorders from Adolescence to Early Adulthood: A Systematic Review.,Filipponi C; Visentini C; Filippini T; Cutino A; Ferri P; Rovesti S; Latella E; Di Lorenzo R,"Eating disorders (EDs) are common among children and adolescents and are characterized by excessive concerns for physical appearance, distorted body image, and fear of gaining weight. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the follow-up of EDs from adolescence to adulthood, analyzing persistence, relapses, and associated comorbidities. We searched scientific articles in PubMed, PsycInfo, Scopus, and Embase through two research strings, one for quantitative outcomes (recovery/persistence, relapse, and remission) and one for the other outcomes (psychiatric and medical comorbidities, substance use, and social-relational complications). From a total of 8043 retrieved articles, we selected 503 papers after exclusion of duplicates and title/abstract screening. After a full-text evaluation, we included 16 studies eligible for this review. We performed a meta-analysis describing the quantitative results, and we created a narrative synthesis for the qualitative outcomes. Results: Our results confirm that EDs can persist in early adulthood in 40.7% of cases with a relapse percentage of 24.5%. Individuals with an ED more frequently present with an empathy deficit and comorbid anxiety and depressive disorders. EDs are chronic and complex disorders, more frequent in females.

In the present systematic review and meta-analysis, we examined cohort studies and clinical trials published between 1980 and 2021 that reported, for DSM/ICD-defined EDs, overall ED outcomes (i.e., recovery, improvement and relapse, all-cause and ED-related hospitalization, and chronicity); the same outcomes related to purging, binge eating and body weight status; as well as mortality. We included 415 studies (N=88,372, mean age: 25.7±6.9 years, females: 72.4%, mean follow-up: 38.3±76.5 months), conducted in persons with anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), binge eating disorder (BED), other specified feeding and eating disorders (OSFED), and/or mixed EDs, from all continents except Africa. In all EDs pooled together, overall recovery occurred in 46% of patients (95% CI: 44-49, n=283, mean follow-up: 44.9±62.8 months, no significant ED-group difference). The recovery rate was 42% at <2 years, 43% at 2 to <4 years, 54% at 4 to <6 years, 59% at 6 to <8 years, 64% at 8 to <10 years, and 67% at ≥10 years. Overall chronicity occurred in 25% of patients (95% CI: 23-29, n=170, mean follow-up: 59.3±71.2 months, no significant ED-group difference). The chronicity rate was 33% at <2 years, 40% at 2 to <4 years, 23% at 4 to <6 years, 25% at 6 to <8 years, 12% at 8 to <10 years, and 18% at ≥10 years. Mortality occurred in 0.4% of patients (95% CI: 0.2-0.7, n=214, mean follow-up: 72.2±117.7 months, no significant ED-group difference). Considering observational studies, the mortality rate was 5.2 deaths/1,000 person-years (95% CI: 4.4-6.1, n=167, mean follow-up: 88.7±120.5 months; significant difference among EDs: p<0.01, range: from 8.2 for mixed ED to 3.4 for BN). Hospitalization occurred in 26% of patients (95% CI: 18-36, n=18, mean follow-up: 43.2±41.6 months; significant difference among EDs: p<0.001, range: from 32% for AN to 4% for BN). Regarding diagnostic migration, 8% of patients with AN migrated to BN and 16% to OSFED; 2% of patients with BN migrated to AN, 5% to BED, and 19% to OSFED; 9% of patients with BED migrated to BN and 19% to OSFED; 7% of patients with OSFED migrated to AN and 10% to BN. Children/adolescents had more favorable outcomes across and within EDs than adults. Self-injurious behaviors were associated with lower recovery rates in pooled EDs. A higher socio-demographic index moderated lower recovery and higher chronicity in AN across countries. Specific treatments associated with higher recovery rates were family-based therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), psychodynamic therapy, and nutritional interventions for AN; self-help, CBT, dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT), psychodynamic therapy, nutritional and pharmacological treatments for BN; CBT, nutritional and pharmacological interventions, and DBT for BED; and CBT and psychodynamic therapy for OSFED. In AN, pharmacological treatment was associated with lower recovery, and waiting list with higher mortality. These results should inform future research, clinical practice and health service organization for persons with EDs.",2024,Feb,World Psychiatry,23,1,124-138,,10.1002/wps.21182,38214616,#25,Solmi 2024,,Longer term outcomes,
The effectiveness of compassion focused therapy with clinical populations: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Millard LA; Wan MW; Smith DM; Wittkowski A,"BACKGROUND: Over the last 20 years, compassion focused therapy (CFT) has gained popularity as an emerging 'third wave' intervention. Although previous reviews indicated its potential benefits, a systematic review and meta-analysis of CFT in those with mental health difficulties has yet to be conducted. METHODS: A systematic search of five databases was undertaken, focusing on randomised controlled trials and randomised pilot/feasibility studies of CFT only. No language restrictions were implemented. A narrative synthesis was conducted. Random effects meta-analyses were measured on levels of self-compassion, self-criticism/self-reassurance, fears of compassion and clinical symptomology. RESULTS: Fifteen studies from 2013 to 2022 were included. Findings suggested that CFT was effective in improving compassion-based outcomes and clinical symptomology from baseline to post-intervention and compared to waitlist control. A range of small to large effect sizes were reported for improvements in self-compassion (0.19-0.90), self-criticism (0.15-0.72), self-reassurance (0.43-0.81), fear of self-compassion (0.18), depression (0.24-0.25) and eating disorders (0.18-0.79). Meta-analyses favoured CFT in improving levels of self-compassion and self-reassurance than control groups. LIMITATIONS: The methodological quality of many of the included studies (7/15) was rated as 'unclear' due to a lack of information. There was a distinct gender gap, with 74.88% identifying as female participants. CONCLUSIONS: This review was the first to examine the effectiveness of CFT in clinical populations. The results indicate that CFT has promising clinical implications, suggesting that the intervention increases compassion-based outcomes and reduces clinical symptomology in those with mental health difficulties. However, future research is required into the long-term effects of CFT.",2023,Apr,J Affect Disord,326,,168-192,,10.1016/j.jad.2023.01.010,36649790,#29,Millard 2023,,Psychological treatment,
A systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence of mental disorders among children and adolescents in Europe.,Sacco R; Camilleri N; Eberhardt J; Umla-Runge K; Newbury-Birch D,"Most mental disorders appear by age 14, but in most cases, they remain undiagnosed and untreated well into adulthood. A scoping review showed an absence of systematic reviews that address prevalence rates of mental disorders among children and adolescents in Europe that are based on community studies conducted between 2015 and 2020. To estimate the updated pooled prevalence of Anxiety Disorder, Depressive Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Conduct Disorder (CD), Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), Autism Spectrum Disorder, Eating Disorders, Substance Use Disorders (SUD), among children and adolescents living in Europe, a search strategy was conducted using MEDLINE, Embase and Psych Info and studies were also identified from reference lists and gray literature. Eligible studies were evaluated for reliability, validity, and bias. Trends of prevalence rates for each mental disorder were calculated. Almost one in five young people in Europe were found to suffer from a mental disorder, with a pooled prevalence rate of 15.5%. Anxiety disorders had the highest pooled prevalence rate (7.9% (95% CI 5.1-11.8%, I(2): 98.0%)), followed by ADHD (2.9% (95% CI 1.2-6.9%, I(2) = 94.3%)), ODD (1.9% (95% CI 1.0-3.7%, I(2) = 98.4%)), depressive disorder (1.7% (95% CI 1.0-2.9%, I(2) = 97.7%)), CD (1.5% (95% CI 0.6-3.8%, I(2) = 98.8%)) and ASD (1.4% (95% CI 0.4-5.4%, I(2) = 99.7%). No studies on SUD were identified. The mental health of children and adolescents may be improved by introducing routine screening, refining diagnostic sensitivity, raising awareness of mental disorders, minimizing stigma and socioeconomic inequality, as well as developing early intervention services. These facilitators of good mental health need to be prioritized, especially at a time of unprecedented risk factors for poor mental health.",2024,Sep,Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry,33,9,2877-2894,,10.1007/s00787-022-02131-2,36581685,#34,Sacco 2024,,Adolescents; ED is a sub-group analysis only; Prevalence rates,
Anorexia nervosa and adrenal hormones: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Thavaraputta S; Ungprasert P; Witchel SF; Fazeli PK,"OBJECTIVE: Anorexia nervosa is a primary psychiatric disorder characterized by self-induced negative energy balance. A number of hormonal responses and adaptations occur in response to starvation and low body weight including changes in adrenocortical hormones. Our objective was to systematically review adrenocortical hormone levels in anorexia nervosa. DESIGN/METHODS: We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies that reported at least one adrenocortical hormone, including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA-sulphate (DHEA-S), progesterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, pregnenolone, cortisol (serum, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, and hair sample), aldosterone, androstenedione, and testosterone in patients with anorexia nervosa and normal-weight healthy controls from inception until October 2021. Means and standard deviations for each hormone were extracted from the studies to calculate a mean difference (MD). A pooled MD was then calculated by combining MDs of each study using the random-effects model. RESULTS: We included a total of 101 studies with over 2500 females with anorexia nervosa. Mean cortisol levels were significantly higher in anorexia nervosa as compared to normal-weight controls for multiple forms of measurement, including morning cortisol, 12-hour and 24-hour pooled serum cortisol, 24-hour urine cortisol, and after an overnight dexamethasone suppression test. In contrast, mean serum total testosterone and DHEA-S levels were significantly lower among patients with anorexia nervosa. CONCLUSIONS: Women with anorexia nervosa have higher cortisol levels and lower DHEA-S and testosterone levels compared to women without anorexia nervosa. This finding is important to consider when evaluating low-weight women for disorders involving the adrenal axis, especially Cushing's syndrome.",2023,Sep,Eur J Endocrinol,189,3,S64-S73,,10.1093/ejendo/lvad123,37669399,#37,Thavaraputta 2023,,Anorexia; medical aspects of ED,
Peripheral Biomarkers of Anorexia Nervosa: A Meta-Analysis.,Wu YK; Watson HJ; Del Re AC; Finch JE; Hardin SL; Dumain AS; Brownley KA; Baker JH,"The pathogenesis of anorexia nervosa (AN) has been hypothesized to involve several biological systems. However, reliable biomarkers for AN have yet to be established. This study was aimed to identify statistically significant and clinically meaningful peripheral biomarkers associated with AN. A systematic literature search was conducted to identify studies published in English from inception until 30 June 2022. We conducted two-level random-effects meta-analyses to examine the difference between AN and comparison groups across 52 distinct biomarkers and found that acylated ghrelin, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), carboxy-terminal collagen crosslinks (CTX), cholesterol, cortisol, des-acyl ghrelin, ghrelin, growth hormone (GH), obestatin, and soluble leptin receptor levels were significantly higher in cases of AN compared with those in non-AN controls. Conversely, C-reactive protein (CRP), CD3 positive, CD8, creatinine, estradiol, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), free thyroxine, free triiodothyronine, glucose, insulin, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), leptin, luteinizing hormone, lymphocyte, and prolactin levels were significantly lower in AN compared with those in non-AN controls. Our findings indicate that peripheral biomarkers may be linked to the pathophysiology of AN, such as processes of adaptation to starvation. Scientific investigation into peripheral biomarkers may ultimately yield breakthroughs in personalized clinical care for AN.",2024,Jun,Nutrients,16,13,,,10.3390/nu16132095,38999843,#41,Wu 2024,,Anorexia; medical aspects of ED,
Shame and eating disorders symptoms: A meta-analysis.,Nechita DM; Bud S; David D,"OBJECTIVE: Numerous empirical studies and theoretical models posit that shame is a common experience among individuals across the eating disorder spectrum. In this study we aim to investigate the association between shame and eating disorders symptoms using a meta-analytical approach. METHOD: In this meta-analysis, we synthesized findings from 195 studies to examine the proposed association between shame and eating disorders symptoms. We looked at the associations with both general eating disorders symptoms and with specific eating disorders symptoms (i.e., anorexic, bulimic, and binge-eating symptoms). Moderation analyses testing for the effect of type of shame, type of eating symptoms, clinical status, quality of the study, age, and gender were conducted. RESULTS: Shame was significantly associated with a medium to large effect size with all types of eating disorders symptoms (rs between .40 and .52). Body shame (r = .55) and shame around eating (r = .59) were more strongly related with eating disorders pathology. Type of eating disorders symptoms did not moderate the relationship between shame and disturbed eating. DISCUSSION: Overall, the magnitude of the effect size of the association between shame and eating disorders symptoms is a medium to large one. Body shame and shame around eating seem to be the types of shame most closely tied with eating disorders symptoms, suggesting that directly targeting them in interventions might be highly beneficial. Findings highlight current gaps in the literature (e.g., mostly correlational studies, low quality studies) with implications for future research.",2021,Nov,Int J Eat Disord,54,11,1899-1945,,10.1002/eat.23583,34302369,#43,Nechita 2021,,ED phenomenology; psychological comorbidities,

The aim of the current review was to synthesize the differences in neuropsychological test performance between individuals with AN and healthy controls, quantify and explain their heterogeneity. The search and screening procedures resulted in fifty studies that comprised 186 neuropsychological test results. Utilizing random-effects meta-analyses, the results revealed evidence for significant, moderate underperformance in people with AN in overall neuropsychological functioning (g¯ = -0.43, 95 % CI [-0.50, -0.36]). Weighted mean effect sizes ranged from g¯ = -0.53 for visuospatial abilities to g¯ = -0.10 for planning.

Adiponectin in anorexia nervosa and its modifiers: A meta-regression study.,Tural U; Iosifescu DV,"OBJECTIVE: Adiponectin, which is secreted from adipose tissue, is a protein hormone. Although a large body of studies have found that circulating adiponectin levels increase in anorexia nervosa (AN) and caloric restriction, the effect of subtypes of AN and modifiers of adiponectin in AN are not yet known. METHODS: A systematic search of electronic databases was performed using the search terms ""adiponectin,"" ""anorexia nervosa,"" and ""eating disorder"" up to January 2021. All studies published in peer-reviewed journals, which included cases and control groups, were selected. The main outcome was the pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) in adiponectin levels between cases and controls, using the random-effects model. Modifiers of SMD were tested via meta-regression. Heterogeneity and publication bias were evaluated. RESULTS: Thirty-four studies met all eligibility criteria. The total sample of AN participants (Hedges' g = .765, p < .0001), and specifically the binge-eating/purging (Hedges' g = 1.211, p < .00001) and restrictive subtypes (Hedges' g = .913, p < .00001) of AN have increased adiponectin plasma levels compared with healthy controls. Meta-regression determined that insulin, IGF-1, BMI, triglyceride, resistin, glucose, IL-6 levels are significant modifiers of adiponectin levels. DISCUSSION: Compared with controls, adiponectin levels are higher in AN overall, and specifically in the binge-eating/purging and the restrictive AN subtypes. Many of metabolic parameters of glucose metabolism and pro-inflammatory molecules modify the relationship between AN and adiponectin levels. Adipose tissue is important to maintain metabolic stability. PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE: Anorexia nervosa is a psychiatric disorder associated with a severe decrease in body weight and multiple metabolic abnormalities, including an increase in the hormone adiponectin. In this paper, we used meta-analysis, a powerful statistical method, to aggregate data from 34 rigorously selected research reports. This enabled us to understand the value of adiponectin to differentiate clinical subtypes of anorexia nervosa and the relations between adiponectin and other important metabolic parameters.",2022,Oct,Int J Eat Disord,55,10,1279-1290,,10.1002/eat.23753,35689560,#46,Tural 2022,,Anorexia; medical comorbidity,
Anhedonia in eating disorders: A meta-analysis and systematic review.,Dolan SC; Khindri R; Franko DL; Thomas JJ; Reilly EE; Eddy KT,"OBJECTIVE: Anhedonia, or loss of pleasure, is related to deficits in reward processing across a variety of psychiatric disorders. In light of research suggesting abnormal reward processing in eating disorders (EDs), the study of anhedonia in EDs may yield important insights into the role of reward in eating pathology. This meta-analysis and review aimed to provide both a quantitative and qualitative synthesis of the existing literature on this topic. METHOD: We conducted this research (or these meta-analyses) according to PRISMA guidelines. We searched four databases for both peer-reviewed and unpublished literature, and included studies only if a self-report or clinical interview measure of anhedonia was administered to a sample with an ED diagnosis. RESULTS: We included 21 studies in the systematic review, and 10 studies in two meta-analyses that compared anhedonia between ED and control samples (n = 9 studies) and within different ED diagnoses (n = 5 studies). Meta-analyses revealed that anhedonia was significantly higher in ED groups compared to healthy controls, but there was no significant difference in anhedonia between ED diagnostic groups. A qualitative review of the literature also suggested that anhedonia may be correlated with increased ED symptom severity. DISCUSSION: Findings indicated that anhedonia is elevated in EDs and may be a relevant treatment target. Future research should examine how self-reported anhedonia may correlate with components of reward processing in EDs in order to improve theoretical models as well as targeted interventions.",2022,Feb,Int J Eat Disord,55,2,161-175,,10.1002/eat.23645,34811779,#47,Dolan 2022,,ED phenomenology; Symptom correlates of ED,
Sleep quality in eating disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Degasperi G; Meneo D; Curati S; Cardi V; Baglioni C; Cellini N,"Eating disorders (ED) are psychological disorders characterized by dangerous eating behaviours, including protracted fasting and binge eating. Mental disorders comorbidities (e.g., anxiety and depression), as well as sleep difficulties, are common and might interfere with treatment response. This work investigated sleep quality, circadian preferences, and sleep disorders in ED patients compared to healthy controls (HC) and the impact of ED treatment on patients' sleep. A literature search on Pubmed, Web of Science, Medline, and PsychInfo included 27 studies. Random effect analyses were performed (sample eating disorders = 711; sample healthy controls = 653) and subgroup analyses were calculated based on the ED subgroups: Anorexia Nervosa, Bulimia Nervosa, Binge Eating Disorder. Whole sample analyses showed poorer physiological and subjective sleep quality in patients. Subgroup analyses showed that poorer physiological sleep was present only in anorexia nervosa. Two studies reporting circadian preferences and sleep disorders showed higher evening preference in patients and no differences in apnea prevalence between patients and healthy controls, respectively. Some studies suggested that specialized eating disorder treatments (e.g., Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for ED) can improve sleep quality in patients.

Life expectancy and years of potential life lost in people with mental disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Chan JKN; Correll CU; Wong CSM; Chu RST; Fung VSC; Wong GHS; Lei JHC; Chang WC,"BACKGROUND: Mental disorders are associated with premature mortality. There is increasing research examining life expectancy and years-of-potential-life-lost (YPLL) to quantify the disease impact on survival in people with mental disorders. We aimed to systematically synthesize studies to estimate life expectancy and YPLL in people with any and specific mental disorders across a broad spectrum of diagnoses. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Embase, MEDLINE, PsychINFO, WOS from inception to July 31, 2023, for published studies reporting life expectancy and/or YPLL for mental disorders. Criteria for study inclusion were: patients of all ages with any mental disorders; reported data on life expectancy and/or YPLL of a mental-disorder cohort relative to the general population or a comparison group without mental disorders; and cohort studies. We excluded non-cohort studies, publications containing non-peer-reviewed data or those restricted to population subgroups. Survival estimates, i.e., life expectancy and YPLL, were pooled (based on summary data extracted from the included studies) using random-effects models. Subgroup analyses and random-effects meta-regression analyses were performed to explore sources of heterogeneity. Risk-of-bias assessment was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42022321190). FINDINGS: Of 35,865 studies identified in our research, 109 studies from 24 countries or regions including 12,171,909 patients with mental disorders were eligible for analysis (54 for life expectancy and 109 for YPLL). Pooled life expectancy for mental disorders was 63.85 years (95% CI 62.63-65.06; I(2) = 100.0%), and pooled YPLL was 14.66 years (95% CI 13.88-15.98; I(2) = 100.0%). Disorder-stratified analyses revealed that substance-use disorders had the shortest life expectancy (57.07 years [95% CI 54.47-59.67]), while neurotic disorders had the longest lifespan (69.51 years [95% CI 67.26-71.76]). Substance-use disorders exhibited the greatest YPLL (20.38 years [95% CI 18.65-22.11]), followed by eating disorders (16.64 years [95% CI 7.45-25.82]), schizophrenia-spectrum disorders (15.37 years [95% CI 14.18-16.55]), and personality disorders (15.35 years [95% CI 12.80-17.89]). YPLLs attributable to natural and unnatural deaths in mental disorders were 4.38 years (95% CI 3.15-5.61) and 8.11 years (95% CI 6.10-10.13; suicide: 8.31 years [95% CI 6.43-10.19]), respectively. Stratified analyses by study period suggested that the longevity gap persisted over time. Significant cross-study heterogeneity was observed.

Food insecurity and binge eating: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Abene JA; Tong J; Minuk J; Lindenfeldar G; Chen Y; Chao AM,"OBJECTIVE: This review synthesized literature on the relationship between food insecurity and binge eating. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified by searching PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and gray literature from inception to October 2022. Eligible studies included primary research that assessed the relationship between food insecurity and binge eating. Data extraction was performed independently by two reviewers. Pooled odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were obtained from random effect models with the R package meta. Analyses were stratified by binge eating versus binge-eating disorder (BED), study type (cross-sectional vs. longitudinal), and age (adults vs. adolescents). RESULTS: We included 24 articles that reported on 20 studies, and 13 articles were included in the meta-analysis. Based on the random effects meta-analysis, the odds of adults in the food insecure group having binge eating were 1.66 (95% CI = 1.42, 1.93) times the odds of adults in the food secure group having binge eating. The odds of adults in the food insecure group having BED were 2.70 (95% CI = 1.47, 4.96) times the odds of adults in the food secure group having BED. Insufficient data were available for a meta-analysis on adolescents or longitudinal relationships. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support that food insecurity is associated with binge eating in adults. There is a need for research to investigate the mechanisms underlying this relationship. Results highlight the importance of screening participants with food insecurity for disordered eating behaviors and vice versa. Future research is needed to examine whether interventions targeting food insecurity may help to mitigate disordered eating behaviors.

Efficacy of Pharmacotherapies for Bulimia Nervosa: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,Yu S; Zhang Y; Shen C; Shao F,"OBJECTIVE: The main purpose was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of different medications used to treat bulimia nervosa (BN). METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified from published sources through searches in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Embase from inception to November 2022. Primary outcomes were changes in the frequency of binge eating episodes and vomiting episodes from baseline to endpoint. Secondary outcomes were differences in the improvement of scores in depressive symptoms, tolerability (dropout due to adverse events) and weight change. RESULTS: The literature search ultimately included 11 drugs, 33 studies and 6 types of drugs, 8 trials with TCAs (imipra-mine, desipramine), 14 with SSRIs (fluoxetine, citalopram and fluvoxamine), 6 with MAOIs (phenelzine, moclobemide and brofaromine), 3 with antiepileptic drugs (topiramate), 1 with mood stabilizers (lithium), and 1 with amphetamine-type appetite suppressant (fenfluramine). The reduction in binge eating episodes was more likely due to these drugs than the placebo, and the SMD was -0.4 (95% CI -0.61 ∼ -0.19); the changes in the frequency of vomiting episodes (SMD = -0.16, 95% CI -0.3 ∼ -0.03); weight (WMD = -3.05, 95% CI -5.97 ∼ -0.13); and depressive symptoms (SMD =-0.32, 95% CI -0.51 ∼ -0.13). However, no significant difference was found in dropout due to adverse events (RR = 1.66, 95% CI 1.14 ∼ 2.41). CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis indicates that most pharmacotherapies decreased the frequency of binge-eating and vomiting episodes, body weight, and depressive symptoms in BN patients, but the efficacy was not significant.

Eating disorder symptomatology among transgender individuals: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Rasmussen SM; Dalgaard MK; Roloff M; Pinholt M; Skrubbeltrang C; Clausen L; Kjaersdam Telléus G,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to synthesize the literature on eating disorders and eating disorder symptomatology among transgender individuals and to summarize the existing literature on gender-affirming treatment and the prevalence of eating disorder symptomatology. METHOD: The literature search for this systematic review and meta-analysis was performed in PubMed, Embase.com, and Ovid APA PsycInfo. We searched for ""eating disorders"" and ""transgender"" using both controlled vocabularies and natural language terms for their synonyms. The PRISMA statement guidelines were followed. Quantitative data from studies on transgender individuals and eating disorders assessed with relevant assessment tools was included. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies were included for the qualitative synthesis, and 14 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The results revealed higher levels of eating disorder symptomatology among transgender individuals compared with cisgender individuals, especially cisgender men. Transgender men tend to display higher levels of eating disorder symptomatology than transgender women; however, transgender women seem to have higher levels of eating disorder symptomatology than cisgender men and, interestingly, this study also noted a trend toward transgender men having higher levels of eating disorders than cisgender women.

The Co-Occurrence of Autism and Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID): A Prevalence-Based Meta-Analysis.,Sader M; Weston A; Buchan K; Kerr-Gaffney J; Gillespie-Smith K; Sharpe H; Duffy F,"OBJECTIVE: Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) is a feeding and eating disorder characterized by extensive avoidance and/or restriction of food. Existing research demonstrates that ARFID is over-represented in Autistic populations and vice-versa, with both groups exhibiting shared characteristics. This meta-analysis investigated the co-occurrence between ARFID and autism via determination of autism prevalence in ARFID populations, and ARFID prevalence in Autistic groups. METHOD: This review systematically identified literature evaluating those with ARFID and Autistic individuals. Literature was searched for using SCOPUS, MEDLINE, and Web of Science. Selected publications included Autistic individuals and those with ARFID who either received a formal diagnosis of autism and/or ARFID or met clinical threshold cut-off scores on validated autism and/or ARFID questionnaires. Prevalence was reported in proportion-based values alongside 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: This meta-analysis identified 21 studies (kARFID = 18 papers; kAutism = 3 papers) comprising of n = 7442 participants (nARFID = 1708; nAutism = 5734). Prevalence of autism diagnoses was 16.27% in those with ARFID (95% CI = 8.64%-28.53%), and ARFID prevalence in Autistic groups was 11.41% (95% CI = 2.89%-35.76%). Gender and ethnicity served as significant sources of heterogeneity in ARFID papers. There was insufficient data to provide comparator values or prevalence across study population and distinct underpinning drivers of ARFID. DISCUSSION: Meta-analytic findings highlight significant rates of co-occurrence between autism and ARFID, suggesting that in clinical settings, it may be beneficial to consider screening Autistic individuals for ARFID and vice-versa. Future research should further investigate co-occurrence across ARFID profiles, gender, and ethnicity.",2025,Mar,Int J Eat Disord,58,3,473-488,,10.1002/eat.24369,39760303,#54,Sader 2025,,,
The transition from restrictive anorexia nervosa to binging and purging: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Serra R; Di Nicolantonio C; Di Febo R; De Crescenzo F; Vanderlinden J; Vrieze E; Bruffaerts R; Loriedo C; Pasquini M; Tarsitani L,"Numerous studies addressed the topic of behavioral and symptomatic changes in eating disorders. Rates of transition vary widely across studies, ranging from 0 to 70.8%, depending on the diagnoses taken into account and the study design. Evidence shows that the specific transition from restrictive-type anorexia nervosa (AN-R) to disorders involving binging and purging behaviors (BPB) is related to a worsening of the clinical picture and worse long-term outcomes. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to focus on this specific transition, review existing literature, and summarize related risk factors. Medline and PsycINFO databases were searched, including prospective and retrospective studies on individuals with AN-R. The primary outcome considered was the rate of onset of BPB. Twelve studies (N = 725 patients) were included in the qualitative and quantitative analysis. A total of 41.84% (95% CI 33.58-50.11) of patients with AN-R manifested BPB at some point during follow-up. Risk factors for the onset of BPB included potentially treatable and untreatable factors such as the family environment, unipolar depression and higher premorbid BMI. These findings highlight that patients with AN-R frequently transition to BPB over time, with a worsening of the clinical picture. Existing studies in this field are still insufficient and heterogeneous, and further research is needed. Mental health professionals should be aware of the frequent onset of BPB in AN-R and its risk factors and take this information into account in the treatment of AN-R.

Increased Prevalence of Binge Eating Disorder and Bulimia Nervosa in Women With Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,Cooney LG; Gyorfi K; Sanneh A; Bui LM; Mousa A; Tay CT; Teede H; Stener-Victorin E; Brennan L,"CONTEXT: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with disordered eating/eating disorders, but prior meta-analyses are limited by small numbers. OBJECTIVE: To inform the 2023 International PCOS Guideline, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the prevalence of disordered eating/eating disorders among women with and without PCOS. METHODS: Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, and All EMB were searched from inception through February 1, 2024, for studies that compared prevalences of eating disordered/disordered eating in adolescent or adult women. Random effects meta-analyses were used to estimate the pooled odds ratios (OR) or standardized mean differences (SMD) of outcomes in women with PCOS compared to controls. Methodological quality was assessed by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) system, and included studies were assessed for risk of bias. RESULTS: Of 1352 articles identified, 20 were included, with a total of 28 922 women with PCOS and 258 619 controls. Individuals with PCOS had higher odds of any eating disorder (OR: 1.53 [1.29, 1.82], 8 studies), which persisted in studies where PCOS was diagnosed by Rotterdam criteria (OR: 2.88 [1.55, 5.34], 4 studies). Odds of bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, and disordered eating, but not anorexia nervosa, were increased in PCOS. Mean disordered eating scores were higher in PCOS (SMD: 0.52 [0.28, 0.77], 13 studies), including when stratified by normal and higher weight body mass index. Most included studies were of moderate quality, with no evidence of publication bias.

Physical health complications in children and young people with avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID): a systematic review and meta-analysis.,James RM; O'Shea J; Micali N; Russell SJ; Hudson LD,"BACKGROUND: Avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID) is a feeding and eating disorder with known acute and longstanding physical health complications in children and young people (CYP) and commonly presents to paediatricians. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review the published literature on physical health complications in CYP with ARFID using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO and Cochrane Library was performed on 14 February 2024. Studies reporting physical health complications in CYP ≤25 years with ARFID were included. We pooled studies for meta-analysis comparing ARFID with healthy controls or anorexia nervosa (AN). RESULTS: Of 9058 studies found in searches, we included 132 studies. We found evidence for low weight, nutritional deficiencies and low bone mineral density. CYP with ARFID can present across the weight spectrum; however, the majority of CYP with ARFID were within the healthy weight to underweight range. Most studies reported normal range heart rates and blood pressures in ARFID, but some CYP with ARFID do experience bradycardia and hypotension. CYP with ARFID had higher heart rates than AN (weighted mean difference: 12.93 bpm; 95% CI: 8.65 to 17.21; n=685); heterogeneity was high (I(2): 81.33%). CONCLUSION: There is a broad range of physical health complications associated with ARFID requiring clinical consideration. Many CYP with ARFID are not underweight yet still have complications. Less cardiovascular complications found in ARFID compared with AN may be related to chronicity.

Length of stay for anorexia nervosa: Systematic review and meta-analysis.,Kan C; Hawkings YR; Cribben H; Treasure J,"OBJECTIVE: Evidence regarding global trends in length of stay for patients with anorexia nervosa is limited. The aim of this study is to conduct a meta-analysis examining the length of stay for anorexia nervosa patients globally, and to investigate moderators of the variance. METHOD: Medline, EMBASE and PsycINFO were searched for studies published up to January 2019. Two independent reviewers assessed the eligibility of each report based on predefined inclusion criteria. A meta-analysis was performed to calculate a pooled mean length of stay using the random-effects model. Subgroup analyses and meta-regression were conducted to explore potential sources of heterogeneity between studies. RESULTS: Of 305 abstracts reviewed, 71 studies met the inclusion criteria, generating 111 datasets. The pooled mean length of stay (95% confidence interval) was 76.3 days (73.3, 79.4) using the random-effects model, with marked variation across countries and time. Heterogeneity between studies was explained by age and admission body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis found that although clinical features do contribute to length of admissions for anorexia nervosa, there are also global and temporal variations.

Direct economic burden of mental health disorders associated with polycystic ovary syndrome: Systematic review and meta-analysis.,Yadav S; Delau O; Bonner AJ; Markovic D; Patterson W; Ottey S; Buyalos RP; Azziz R,"BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common hormone disorder affecting about one in seven reproductive-aged women worldwide and approximately 6 million women in the United States (U.S.). PCOS can be a significant burden to those affected and is associated with an increased prevalence of mental health (MH) disorders such as depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and postpartum depression. We undertook this study to determine the excess economic burden associated with MH disorders in women with PCOS in order to allow for a more accurate prioritization of the disorder as a public health priority. METHODS: Following PRISMA reporting guidelines for systematic review, we searched PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO, Medline, Scopus, and PsycINFO through July 16, 2021, for studies on MH disorders in PCOS. Excluded were studies not in humans, without controls, without original data, or not peer reviewed. As anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and postpartum depression were by far the most common MH disorders assessed by the studies, we performed our meta-analysis on these disorders. Meta-analyses were performed using the DerSimonian-Laird random effects model to compute pooled estimates of prevalence ratios (PRs) for the associations between PCOS and these MH disorders and then calculated the excess direct costs related to these disorders in U.S. dollars (USD) for women suffering from PCOS in the U.S. alone. The quality of selected studies was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. RESULTS: We screened 78 articles by title/abstract, assessed 43 articles in full text, and included 25 articles. Pooled PRs were 1.42 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.32-1.52) for anxiety, 1.65 (95% CI: 1.44-1.89) for depression, 1.48 (95% CI: PR: 1.06-2.05) for eating disorders, and 1.20 (95% CI: 0.96-1.50) for postpartum depression, for PCOS relative to controls. In the U.S., the additional direct healthcare costs associated with anxiety, depression, and eating disorders in PCOS were estimated to be $1.939 billion/yr, $1.678 billion/yr, and $0.644 billion/yr in 2021 USD, respectively. Postpartum depression was excluded from the cost analyses due to the non-significant meta-analysis result. Taken together, the additional direct healthcare costs associated with anxiety, depression, and eating disorders in PCOS were estimated to be $4.261 billion/yr in 2021 USD. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the direct healthcare annual costs for the most common MH disorders in PCOS, namely anxiety, depression, and eating disorders, exceeds $4 billion in 2021 USD for the U.S. population alone. Taken together with our prior work, these data suggest that the healthcare-related economic burden of PCOS exceeds $15 billion yearly, considering the costs of PCOS diagnosis, and costs related to PCOS-associated MH, reproductive, vascular, and metabolic disorders. As PCOS has much the same prevalence across the world, the excess economic burden attributable to PCOS globally is enormous, mandating that the scientific and policy community increase its focus on this important disorder.

Maternal Eating Disorders and Adverse Birth Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,Milembamane M. MScFN; Moussa N.M. MScFN; Twynstra J. PhD; Seabrook J.A. PhD,"Previous systematic reviews have reported on the relationship between eating disorders (EDs) and birth outcomes, but there are no existing meta-analyses on this topic. This systematic review and meta-analysis examines the association between lifetime maternal EDs, including anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge-eating disorder (BED) with low birth weight (LBW), preterm birth (PTB), small for gestational age (SGA), large for gestational age (LGA), and miscarriage. Four databases were systematically searched for quantitative literature on maternal EDs that preceded birth outcomes. Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The meta-analyses included 6 studies on miscarriage, 11 on PTB, 4 on LBW, 9 on SGA, and 4 on LGA. The Mantel-Haenszel random effects model was used to test the associations between EDs and birth outcomes. The results showed significant positive associations between AN and LBW (OR 1.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.49, 2.03), AN and SGA (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.17, 1.65), BN and PTB (OR 1.19, 95% CI 1.04, 1.36), and BED and LGA (OR 1.43 95% CI 1.18, 1.72).

Dysfunctional decision-making in binge-eating disorder: A meta-analysis and systematic review.,Colton E; Wilson KE; Chong TT; Verdejo-Garcia A,"Binge-Eating Disorder (BED) involves anticipatory craving and urges, subjective loss-of-control during binge-eating episodes, and post-feeding psychological distress and guilt. Evidence indicates neurocognitive dysfunctions contribute to BED onset, maintenance, and treatment response. However, an integrated understanding of how cognitive processes underpin BED symptomology is lacking. We utilised a multi-stage decision-making model defining ten cognitive processes underpinning Preference Formation, Choice Implementation, Feedback Processing, and Flexibility/Shifting, to comprehensively review research published since 2013. We used preregistered PICOS criteria to assess 1966 articles identified from PubMed, PsycInfo, and Scopus database searches. This yielded 50 studies reporting behavioural cognitive tasks outcomes, comparing individuals with BED to controls with normal and higher weight. Meta-analyses revealed a unique profile of cognitive dysfunctions that spanned all decision-making stages. Significant deficits were evident in Uncertainty Evaluation, Attentional Inhibition, Choice Consistency, and Cognitive Flexibility/Set-shifting. We propose a novel model of dysfunctional decision-making processes in BED and describe their role in binge-eating behaviour. We further highlight the potential for cognitive interventions to target these processes and address the significant treatment gap in BED.",2023,Sep,Neurosci Biobehav Rev,152,,105250,,10.1016/j.neubiorev.2023.105250,37263530,#68,Colton 2023,,Binge-eating disorder; Neurocognition,
Predictors of relapse in eating disorders: A meta-analysis.,Sala M; Keshishian A; Song S; Moskowitz R; Bulik CM; Roos CR; Levinson CA,"INTRODUCTION: Eating disorders (EDs) have high rates of relapse. However, it is still not clear which factors are the strongest predictors of ED relapse, and the extent to which predictors of relapse may vary due to study and individual differences. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a meta-analysis to quantify and compare which factors predict relapse in EDs and evaluate various potential moderators of these relations (e.g., ED subtype, sample age, length of follow-up, timing of predictor assessment, relapse operationalization). METHODS: A total of 35 papers (effects = 315) were included. We used a multilevel random-effects model to estimate summary study-level effect sizes, and multilevel mixed-effects models to examine moderator effects. RESULTS: Higher level of care, having psychiatric comorbidity, and higher severity of ED psychopathology were associated with higher odds of relapse. Higher leptin, higher meal energy density/variety, higher motivation for change, higher body mass index/weight/body fat, better response to treatment, anorexia nervosa-restricting (vs. anorexia nervosa-binge purge) subtype diagnosis, and older age of ED onset were associated with lower odds of relapse. Several moderators were identified. DISCUSSION: A variety of variables can predict ED relapse. Furthermore, predictors of ED relapse vary among ED subtypes, sample ages, lengths of follow-up, timing of predictor assessments, and relapse operationalization. Future research should identify the mechanisms by which these variables may contribute to relapse.",2023,Feb,J Psychiatr Res,158,,281-299,,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2023.01.002,36623362,#69,Sala 2023,,Longer term outcomes,
Cognitive function in binge eating disorder and food addiction: A systematic review and three-level meta-analysis.,Iceta S; Rodrigue C; Legendre M; Daoust J; Flaudias V; Michaud A; Bégin C,"BACKGROUND: An extensive body of recent research has focused on the contribution of cognitive functioning to eating behaviors. In binge eating disorder (BED) and food addiction (FA), the extent of cognitive impairment is still unclear. This study aimed to characterize, among those with BED and FA, neurocognitive functions using performances based on neuropsychological tasks in the context of neutral stimuli in adults. METHOD: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, CINAHL and gray literature (ProQuest and OpenGrey) were used to identify studies that reported neurocognitive assessments in BED or FA up to December 2019. A three-level meta-analysis was conducted. RESULTS: A significant overall effect was found for global cognitive impairments, suggesting that individuals with BED or FA have poorer performances when completing cognitive tasks. Analyses for specific cognitive domains revealed that individuals with BED showed poorer performances at tasks assessing cognitive flexibility, inhibitory control, attention and planning. Analyses regarding FA were inconclusive due to a lack of studies. Thus, the results were described qualitatively. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis highlighted the cognitive weaknesses that seem to come with BED and the necessity to integrate them in the assessment and treatment of this condition.

Compulsory treatments in eating disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Atti AR; Mastellari T; Valente S; Speciani M; Panariello F; De Ronchi D,"INTRODUCTION: The aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis are to provide a summary of the current literature concerning compulsory treatments in patients with eating disorders (ED) and to understand whether compulsorily and involuntarily treated patients differ in terms of baseline characteristics and treatment outcomes. METHODS: Relevant articles were identified following the PRISMA guidelines by searching the following terms: ""treatment refusal"", ""forced feeding"", ""compulsory/coercive/involuntary/forced treatment/admission"", ""eating disorders"", ""feeding and eating disorders"", ""anorexia nervosa"", ""bulimia nervosa"". Research was restricted to articles concerning humans and published between 1975 and 2020 in English. RESULTS: Out of 905 articles retrieved, nine were included for the analyses allowing the comparisons between 242 compulsorily and 738 voluntarily treated patients. Mean body mass index (BMI) was slightly lower in patients compelled to treatments. Mean illness duration, BMI at discharge and BMI variation showed no significant differences between the two groups. Average length of hospitalization was 3 weeks longer among compulsory-treated patients, but this did not result in a higher increase in BMI. No significant risk difference on mortality was estimated (three studies). CONCLUSIONS: Compulsory treatments are usually intended for patients having worse baseline conditions than voluntary ones. Those patients are unlikely to engage in treatments without being compelled but, after the treatments, albeit with longer hospitalisations, they do achieve similar outcomes. Therefore, we can conclude that forcing patients to treatment is a conceivable option.

Rigorous synthesis of dietary intake in anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), binge-eating disorder (BED), and similar EDs is needed to explore similarities and differences. In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement, we conducted a systematic review and quantitative synthesis of studies of dietary intake. Searches of three electronic databases resulted in thirty-nine included studies. Meta-analyses of subsets of these studies were undertaken to summarise macronutrient intake across AN, BN, and BED. Study quality was assessed using the American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Quality Criteria Checklist, with ratings either Positive (k = 27) or Neutral (k = 12). Adults with AN had low energy intake and those with BED reported elevated macronutrient intake. Individuals with BN reported wide variation in energy intake, including some of the highest estimates. Individuals with AN were likely to under-consume key micronutrients, with sodium potentially over-consumed in BN and BED. Vitamin D was under-consumed across all disorders.

Results summarizing 170 effect sizes from 69 studies (N = 41,257) showed two main groups of findings. Firstly, that SPA and ED were very largely related (i.e., r = .51). Secondly, that this relationship was stronger (i) among individuals from Western countries, and (ii) when ED scores concerned the diagnostic feature of bulimia/anorexia nervosa involving body image disturbances.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of intensive treatment options for adults with eating disorders.,de Boer K; Johnson C; Wade TD; Radunz M; Fernando AN; Babb J; Stafrace S; Sharp G,"Eating disorders (EDs) are complex conditions with one of the highest mortality rates among psychiatric illnesses. While outpatient evidence-based treatments for EDs in adults exist, there is often utilisation of more intensive interventions as part of treatment. However, a comprehensive analysis of the impacts of intensive treatment (inpatient, residential and day program) on physical and psychosocial outcomes is lacking. Thus, the current systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to investigate the effectiveness of intensive treatments in adults with EDs for the outcomes of body mass index (BMI), disordered eating, depression, and quality of life, as well as a moderation analysis investigating a range of clinical characteristics. Overall, 62 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The results revealed that intensive treatment in adults yielded significant improvements in BMI (for underweight patients), disordered eating, depression, and quality of life. Treatment setting, length of stay and geographical region of the study all served as moderators for disordered eating and depression.

Childhood maltreatment and the risk of eating disorders: a meta-analysis of observational studies.,Amiri S; Sabzehparvar M,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to examine the relationship between childhood maltreatment as a variable of exposure and eating disorders as an outcome. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched to find manuscripts related to the current research. The search was conducted up until October 2023 and limited to the English language. An odds ratio (OR) based on the random effects method was used to combine studies. One subgroup analysis was performed based on the type of eating disorder and another based on the type of childhood maltreatment. RESULTS: Thirty eligible studies were recognized for this research. Childhood maltreatment was associated with a rate of eating disorders of more than double: OR 2.37 with 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.84-3.06 (P < 0.001; I(2) = 92.6%). Childhood maltreatment was associated with anorexia nervosa (OR 1.89, 95% CI 1.47-2.42; Z = 5.03; P < 0.001; I(2) = 0%), bulimia nervosa (OR 2.64, 95% CI 1.34-5.17; Z = 2.82; P = 0.005; I(2) = 93.1%), and binge eating disorder (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.38-2.26; Z = 4.52; P < 0.001; I(2) = 80.2%). CONCLUSION: The findings of this research showed that childhood maltreatment significantly increases the risk of eating disorders. Therefore, in understanding the mechanisms related to eating disorders, it is necessary to pay attention to the issue of the childhood living environment and the traumatic experiences of that time.",2025,Mar,Neuropsychiatr,39,1,36-46,,10.1007/s40211-024-00505-3,39196489,#84,Amiri 2025,Kelsey Hagan (2025-07-08 10:29:00)(Select): Got it!; Sasha Gorrell (2025-07-08 02:40:00)(Select): I can't easily access this PDF; ,Trauma,
Antidepressants compared to placebo for people with binge eating disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Sioziou AL; Lappas AS; Skarlatos M; Mesiari C; Florou MC; Argyrou A; Christodoulou N; Chourdakis M; Samara M,"Binge eating disorder (BED) is the most prevalent eating disorder. Treatment options include pharmacotherapy as well as psychotherapy, with the latter recommended as a first-line option. However, the use of psychotherapeutic interventions poses several challenges. Antidepressants are easily accessible, but they lack robust evidence-base. This systematic review aims to comprehensively examine the efficacy and safety of antidepressants for the treatment of BED. Five databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antidepressants vs. placebo in BED until 23/11/2023. Pairwise meta-analytic evaluations were performed. The primary outcomes were remission and binge eating frequency. Secondary outcomes were response to treatment, eating psychopathology, depression, anxiety, body weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), all-cause discontinuation, discontinuation due to adverse effects and total adverse events. Sixteen RCTs with a total of 984 participants were meta-analysed. Antidepressants were more effective than placebo in achieving remission (RR: 1.39, 95 % CI: 1.04 to 1.86) and in reducing binge eating episodes (SMD: -0.29, 95 % CI: -0.51 to -0.06). Similarly, in the secondary outcomes of response and depression, antidepressants demonstrated superiority over placebo. Antidepressants appear to be effective in reducing symptoms of BED. Small samples and effect sizes hinder the generalizability and clinical utility of these results. There is a lack of follow-up findings regarding the maintenance of effects. There is a pressing need for more RCTs examining antidepressants and other types of pharmacotherapy. Future research should include larger number of participants and increase the duration of follow-up.",2024,Jul,Eur Neuropsychopharmacol,84,,May-15,,10.1016/j.euroneuro.2024.03.006,38642437,#85,Sioziou 2024,,Binge-eating disorder; Pharmacotherapy,
Comorbid obsessive-compulsive disorder in individuals with eating disorders: An epidemiological meta-analysis.,Drakes DH; Fawcett EJ; Rose JP; Carter-Major JC; Fawcett JM,"The present study aimed to provide a precise, meta-analytic estimate of the prevalence of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) amongst those with a current primary eating disorder (ED) diagnosis, and to isolate its predictors. An online search of PubMed and PsycINFO was conducted with a Boolean search phrase incorporating keywords related to OCD, EDs, comorbidity, prevalence, and epidemiology, complemented by references coded from related review articles and contact with experts in the field. Articles were included if they (a) reported an observational study examining current ED diagnoses, (b) used a semi-structured or structured diagnostic interview for OCD and ED diagnosis, (c) applied DSM or ICD criteria, (d) included adolescent or adult samples (age > 12), (e) included patient or community samples, and (f) reported lifetime or current OCD comorbidity. From the 846 articles identified, 35 lifetime and 42 current estimates were calculated. OCD prevalence was extracted from each study for each ED diagnostic category, along with eleven additional potential moderators. Analyses revealed an aggregate lifetime OCD prevalence of 13.9% CI(95%) [10.4 to 18.1] and current OCD prevalence of 8.7% CI(95%) [5.8 to 11.8] across EDs. Moderator analyses revealed the prevalence of and risk for OCD in EDs to be greatest in anorexia nervosa binge-eating purging type (ANBP). Further, OCD is most prevalent amongst patient samples than samples recruited from the community.",2021,Sep,J Psychiatr Res,141,,176-191,,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2021.06.035,34216946,#87,Drakes 2021,,Symptom correlates of ED; psychological comorbidities,
Impairments among DSM-5 eating disorders: A systematic review and multilevel meta-analysis.,Wilkop M; Wade TD; Keegan E; Cohen-Woods S,"Previous research revealed that people who did not meet full DSM-IV criteria for anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), or binge-eating disorder (BED) but met criteria for eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS) display high levels of psychiatric and physical morbidity commensurate with full criteria eating disorders. The DSM-5 introduced significant changes to eating disorder diagnostic criteria, so the present study aimed to determine whether the revised diagnostic criteria better distinguish between full criteria eating disorders, and other specified feeding or eating disorder (OSFED) and unspecified feeding or eating disorder (UFED). We present a series of meta-analyses comparing eating pathology, general psychopathology, and physical health impairments among those with AN, BN, and BED, compared to those with OSFED or UFED (n = 69 eligible studies). Results showed significantly more eating pathology in OSFED compared to AN, no difference in general psychopathology, and greater physical health impairments in AN. BN had greater eating pathology and general psychopathology than OSFED, but OSFED showed more physical health impairments. No differences were found between BN and purging disorder or low-frequency BN, or between BED and OSFED. Findings highlight the clinical severity of OSFED and suggest the DSM-5 criteria may not appropriately account for these presentations.",2023,Apr,Clin Psychol Rev,101,,102267,,10.1016/j.cpr.2023.102267,36963207,#90,Wilkop 2023,,Anorexia; Bulimia; OSFED; Symptom correlates of ED,
The prevalence of rumination syndrome and rumination disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Haworth JJ; Treadway S; Hobson AR,"BACKGROUND: Rumination is characterized by the repeated regurgitation of food. Rumination syndrome is a disorder of gut-brain interaction diagnosed by Rome criteria, whereas rumination disorder is a feeding and eating disorder diagnosed by DSM-5 criteria. We aimed to determine the global prevalence of rumination according to these criteria across all age groups. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting the prevalence of rumination syndrome according to Rome III and Rome IV and rumination disorder according to the following validated DSM-5 assessments: PARDI, EDA-5, EDY-Q, STEP, and STEP-CHILD. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsychINFO (from January 1, 2006, to June 1, 2023) to identify studies reporting the prevalence of rumination in community settings in participants of any age. We did a meta-analysis to estimate the pooled prevalence and odds ratio (OR) of rumination according to diagnostic criteria, country, and characteristics such as age and sex. KEY RESULTS: The search strategy generated 1243 studies, of which 147 studies appeared to be relevant. Thirty studies were included, with a total of 114,228 participants, of whom 61,534 of these were adults and 52,694 were children. The pooled prevalence of rumination syndrome in children of all ages according to Rome III criteria was 1.0% (95% CI 0.3-1.6; I(2) 91.1%), but no data were available for adults. According to Rome IV criteria, the pooled prevalence of rumination syndrome in children of all ages was 0.4% (95% CI 0.2-0.6; I(2) 56.4%) and 3.7% in adults (95% CI 2.3-5.1; I(2) 91.4%). The pooled prevalence of rumination disorder in children of all ages according to EDY-Q was 2.1% (95% CI 0.9-3.4; I(2) = 78.1%), but only one study utilizing EDY-Q in adults was included (0.7% [95% CI 0.4-1.0]). No data were available for children or adults using any other validated DSM-5 assessments for rumination disorder. Irrespective of diagnostic criteria, the pooled prevalence of rumination was higher in adults compared to children and adolescents (3.0% [95% CI 1.4-4.7; I(2) = 98.1%] vs. 0.8% [95% CI 0.4-1.3; I(2) = 90.8%]), but higher in adolescents than in children (1.1% [95% CI 0.3-2.0; I(2) = 92.8%] vs. 0.1% [95% CI 0.0-0.2; I(2) = 24.5%]). In adults, factors independently associated with rumination were female gender (OR 1.4 [95% CI 1.0-2.0]), anxiety (OR 2.3 [95% CI 2.1-2.6]), and depression (OR 1.8 [95% CI 1.2-2.9]). No association between gender and rumination was seen in children. CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES: The prevalence of rumination is more common in adults than in children. In adults, rumination is associated with female gender, anxiety, and depression. Future population studies should aim to better understand why this behavior is more common in adults and also compare validated DSM-5 assessments for rumination disorder with Rome criteria for rumination syndrome as prevalence may differ.",2024,Jul,Neurogastroenterol Motil,36,7,e14793,,10.1111/nmo.14793,38563201,#91,Haworth 2024,,Prevalence rates; rumination syndrome,
Perfectionism and eating disorders in children and adolescents: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Bills E; Greene D; Stackpole R; Egan SJ,"There is a consistent link between perfectionism and eating disorders, however no meta-analysis to date has synthesized this literature in children and adolescents. We hypothesized that there would be significant, small pooled correlations between perfectionism dimensions and eating disorder symptoms in children and adolescents. Published, peer-reviewed articles with standardised measures of perfectionism and eating disorder symptoms were included. Articles were excluded if the age range was over 18 years. Overall, 39 studies were included (N = 13,954 participants, M age = 13.7 years). Total perfectionism (r = 0.25), perfectionistic strivings (r = 0.21), and perfectionistic concerns (r = 0.31) had significant positive associations with eating disorder symptoms. Most studies were rated as fair or good quality. Limitations included high heterogeneity, insufficient studies to investigate age as a moderator, the inclusion of only English articles, and predominately cross-sectional studies which precluded causal inference. Higher perfectionism was associated with greater eating disorder symptoms in children and adolescents. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies of eating disorder symptoms in children and adolescents.",2023,Aug,Appetite,187,,106586,,10.1016/j.appet.2023.106586,37196843,#92,Bills 2023,,Adolescents; ED phenomenology,
Preoperative Binge Eating and Weight Loss After Bariatric Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,Kops NL; Vivan MA; Fülber ER; Fleuri M; Fagundes J; Friedman R,"BACKGROUND: Several studies have investigated if bariatric surgery candidates with binge eating disorder (BED) are at risk for suboptimal postoperative weight loss. The aim of this systematic review with meta-analysis was to evaluate the association between binge eating diagnosed preoperatively and weight loss after bariatric surgery. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, LILACS, and other specialized databases were searched on August 2020. Clinical trials and observational studies including individuals who had undergone any type of bariatric surgical treatment with preoperative evaluation of BED and at least one postoperative measure of weight were initially selected. Four reviewers independently screened for eligibility. The mean difference was calculated using the random-effects model. RESULTS: Nineteen studies, comprising 3223 participants (80.25% women; median age 41 years), met the inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. At 6 months postoperative, the percentage of total weight loss (%TWL) was not significantly different between BED and non-BED groups [6 studies, 914 participants: - 0.75% (95% CI, - 2.79 to 1.29; I(2) = 0%)], even when analyzing only those three studies that included gold standard assessment tools. No significant differences were found at 12, 24, 36, or 60 months. CONCLUSIONS: Pre-bariatric BED seems to have little or no influence on weight loss after surgery. However, many questions remain unanswered because of the use of different measures across studies. The heterogeneity among studies emphasizes the importance of investigators using the same assessment measures.",2021,Mar,Obes Surg,31,3,1239-1248,,10.1007/s11695-020-05124-9,33219919,#95,Kops 2021,Euna Lee (2025-07-16 05:11:03)(Select): eventually led to outcome as BED diagnosis (only 4 cases); ,Binge-eating disorder,
Altered anticipatory brain responses in eating disorders: A neuroimaging meta-analysis.,Yu X; Desrivières S,"OBJECTIVE: Functional neuroimaging studies have found differential neural activation patterns during anticipation-related paradigms in participants with eating disorders (EDs) compared to controls. However, publications reported conflicting results on the directionality and location of the abnormal activations. There is an urgent need to integrate our existing knowledge of anticipation, both rewarding and aversive, to elucidate these differences. METHOD: We conducted an activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis to quantitatively review functional neuroimaging studies that evaluated differences between brain correlates of anticipation in participants with and without disordered eating. PubMed, Web of Sciences, PsycINFO, Medline and EMBASE were searched for studies published up to November 2022. Exploratory sub-analyses to check for differences between reward and non-reward anticipation among all anticipation paradigms. RESULTS: Twenty-one references met the inclusion criteria for meta-analysis. The meta-analysis across anticipation all tasks identified a significant hyperactivation cluster in the right putamen in participants with disordered eating (n = 17 experiments) and a significant hypoactivation cluster in the left inferior parietal lobule (n = 13 experiments), in participants with disordered eating compared to controls.

Numerous voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and resting-state functional imaging studies have provided strong evidence of abnormal brain structure and intrinsic and functional activities in AN, but with inconsistent conclusions. Herein, a whole-brain meta-analysis was conducted on VBM (660 patients with AN, and 740 controls) and resting-state functional imaging (425 patients with AN, and 461 controls) studies that measured differences in the gray matter volume (GMV) and intrinsic functional activity between patients with AN and healthy controls (HCs). Overall, patients with AN displayed decreased GMV in the bilateral median cingulate cortex (extending to the bilateral anterior and posterior cingulate cortex), and left middle occipital gyrus (extending to the left inferior parietal lobe). In resting-state functional imaging studies, patients with AN displayed decreased resting-state functional activity in the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex and bilateral median cingulate cortex, and increased resting-state functional activity in the right parahippocampal gyrus.

Changes in disordered eating behaviors over 10 or more years: A meta-analysis.,Romano KA; Heron KE; Amerson R; Howard LM; MacIntyre RI; Mason TB,"OBJECTIVE: The present meta-analysis evaluated changes in individuals' risk of engaging in distinct disordered eating behaviors (DEBs) in the long-term. METHOD: Longitudinal studies assessing changes in DEBs via ≥2 assessments with a time lag of ≥10 years were included. Risk ratios were calculated for baseline to 10-14.9-year (M = 11.04) follow-up and baseline to ≥15-year (M = 18.62) follow-up changes in the use of binge eating, multiple purging, self-induced vomiting, laxatives, diuretics, diet pills, compensatory exercising, fasting/dieting, and multiple DEBs; Cohen's d was used for continuous binge-eating plus purging variable changes. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses tested whether eating disorder (ED) clinical sample versus nonclinical sample status, female versus male sex/gender, higher versus lower study bias, and baseline mean age and body mass index influenced overall effect magnitude for analyses with sufficient data. RESULTS: Seventeen studies (26 [sub]samples) were included. Overall, individuals' risk of engaging in various restrictive eating and other compensatory behaviors decreased over time and the magnitudes of risk reductions for the use of certain compensatory DEBs were larger over longer follow-up durations. Specifically, for significant DEB change models, risk reductions spanned from 20.0-39.8% for 10-year follow-up and 24.7-74.8% for ≥15-year follow-up. However, nuances were found in the nature of these DEB changes as a function of DEB type, follow-up length, ED versus nonclinical sample composition, and baseline mean age.

Behavioral weight loss outcomes in individuals with binge-eating disorder: A meta-analysis.,Forman EM; Evans BC; Berry MP; Lampe EW; Chwyl C; Zhang F,"OBJECTIVE: Binge-eating disorder (BED) is highly comorbid with obesity. Weight loss may benefit individuals with BED; however, these individuals are often excluded from behavioral weight loss interventions (BWLIs), and findings from BWLIs including participants with and without BED are mixed. To the authors' knowledge, this study represents the first meta-analysis of weight loss outcomes of individuals with and without BED in BWLIs, while adjusting for weight-influencing variables. Treatment dropout rates were also examined. METHODS: Electronic search engines and grey literature search methods were used to identify manuscripts published through December 2022 related to BWLIs and BED. Thirty manuscripts (BED n = 1519; 25 non-BED n = 6345) were included. RESULTS: A meta-regression found that individuals with BED lost less weight compared with individuals without BED (~1.4 kg; ~2.9 kg among studies without meal replacements), but they still lost ~8.1 kg at post-treatment. A random-effects model showed that BED diagnosis increased odds of treatment dropout by 50%.

Behavior Change Techniques Within Digital Interventions for the Treatment of Eating Disorders: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,Thomas PC; Curtis K; Potts HWW; Bark P; Perowne R; Rookes T; Rowe S,"BACKGROUND: Previous systematic reviews of digital eating disorder interventions have demonstrated effectiveness at improving symptoms of eating disorders; however, our understanding of how these interventions work and what contributes to their effectiveness is limited. Understanding the behavior change techniques (BCTs) that are most commonly included within effective interventions may provide valuable information for researchers and developers. Establishing whether these techniques have been informed by theory will identify whether they target those mechanisms of action that have been identified as core to changing eating disorder behaviors. It will also evaluate the importance of a theoretical approach to digital intervention design. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to define the BCTs within digital self-management interventions or minimally guided self-help interventions for adults with eating disorders that have been evaluated within randomized controlled trials. It also assessed which of the digital interventions were grounded in theory and the range of modes of delivery included. METHODS: A literature search identified randomized controlled trials of digital intervention for the treatment of adults with eating disorders with minimal therapist support. Each digital intervention was coded for BCTs using the established BCT Taxonomy v1; for the application of theory using an adapted version of the theory coding scheme (TCS); and for modes of delivery using the Mode of Delivery Ontology. A meta-analysis evaluated the evidence that any individual BCT moderated effect size or that other potential factors such as the application of theory or number of modes of delivery had an effect on eating disorder outcomes. RESULTS: Digital interventions included an average of 14 (SD 2.6; range 9-18) BCTs. Self-monitoring of behavior was included in all effective interventions, with Problem-solving, Information about antecedents, Feedback on behavior, Self-monitoring of outcomes of behavior, and Action planning identified in >75% (13/17) of effective interventions. Social support and Information about health consequences were more evident in effective interventions at follow-up compared with postintervention measurement. The mean number of modes of delivery was 4 (SD 1.6; range 2-7) out of 12 possible modes, with most interventions (15/17, 88%) being web based. Digital interventions that had a higher score on the TCS had a greater effect size than those with a lower TCS score (subgroup differences: χ(2)(1)=9.7; P=.002; I²=89.7%) within the meta-analysis. No other subgroup analyses had statistically significant results. CONCLUSIONS: There was a high level of consistency in terms of the most common BCTs within effective interventions; however, there was no evidence that any specific BCT contributed to intervention efficacy. The interventions that were more strongly informed by theory demonstrated greater improvements in eating disorder outcomes compared to waitlist or treatment-as-usual controls. These results can be used to inform the development of future digital eating disorder interventions.

Cardiac abnormalities identified with echocardiography in anorexia nervosa: systematic review and meta-analysis.,Smythe J; Colebourn C; Prisco L; Petrinic T; Leeson P,"BACKGROUND: Anorexia nervosa affects most organ systems, with 80% suffering from cardiovascular complications. AIMS: To define echocardiographic abnormalities in anorexia nervosa through systematic review and meta-analysis. METHOD: Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility of publications from Medline, EMBASE and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews registries. Studies were included if anorexia nervosa was the primary eating disorder and the main clinical association in described cardiac abnormalities. Data was extracted in duplicate and quality-assessed with a modified Newcastle-Ottawa scale. For continuous outcomes we calculated mean and standardised mean difference (SMD), and corresponding 95% confidence interval. For dichotomous outcomes we calculated proportion and corresponding 95% confidence interval. For qualitative data we summarised the studies. RESULTS: We identified 23 eligible studies totalling 960 patients, with a mean age of 17 years and mean body mass index of 15.2 kg/m2. Fourteen studies (469 participants) reported data suitable for meta-analysis. Cardiac abnormalities seen in anorexia nervosa compared with healthy controls were reduced left ventricular mass (SMD 1.82, 95% CI 1.32-2.31, P < 0.001), reduced cardiac output (SMD 1.92, 95% CI 1.38-2.45, P < 0.001), increased E/A ratio (SMD -1.10, 95% CI -1.67 to -0.54, P < 0.001), and increased incidence of pericardial effusions (25% of patients, P < 0.01, 95% CI 17-34%, I2 = 80%). Trends toward improvement were seen with weight restoration. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with anorexia nervosa have structural and functional cardiac changes, identifiable with echocardiography.

Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder: Systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrating the impact of study quality on prevalence rates.,Nicholls-Clow R; Simmonds-Buckley M; Waller G,"OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) is unclear. This paper is the first to present meta-analysis based estimates of the prevalence of ARFID, and to assess the impact of the quality of the research on these estimates. DESIGN: A pre-registered (Prospero: CRD42023487621) systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: PubMed, PsychInfo, Web of Science and CINAHL were searched (final date of retrieval 30th July 2024) for peer reviewed papers published between 2013 and 2024. Random-effects and quality effects meta-analyses were used to compute and compare prevalence estimates and to evaluate the impact of study quality on prevalence rates. Subgroups were also considered (gender, age group, clinical status). Loney et al.'s (1998) Critical Appraisal of the Health Research Literature: Prevalence or Incidence of a Health Problem scale was used to assign each study a quality score across three categories - methodological validity (six points); interpretation of results (one point); and applicability of the results (one point). RESULTS: Twenty-six studies were identified (n = 122,861). Meta-analysis using random-effects indicated a prevalence of 11.14 % (95 % CI 8.16-14.5 %), whereas quality effects prevalence was 4.51 % (95 % CI 0.7-10.68 %). Similar contrasts were evident among subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Even taking the more conservative estimate of 4.51 %, this review demonstrates that ARFID is a common disorder, meriting further research and clinical and service developments. Future research needs to be more methodologically robust (larger samples; standardised diagnostic measures; clearer data presentation).",2024,Dec,Clin Psychol Rev,114,,102502,,10.1016/j.cpr.2024.102502,39298990,#108,Nicholls-Clow 2024,Emily Lloyd (2025-07-17 07:26:10)(Select): allows broad definition of ED; ,,
Relationship between eating disorder duration and treatment outcome: Systematic review and meta-analysis.,Radunz M; Keegan E; Osenk I; Wade TD,"OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis examine the contribution of duration to treatment outcome for eating disorders. METHOD: Studies (n = 31) were identified that examined associations (r) between duration and 45 different outcomes. We were unable to extract r for seven studies (9 outcomes) and extracted r for 36 outcomes across 24 studies (2,349 participants). Indicators of treatment outcome were heterogeneous and thus a series of different meta-analyses, aimed at increasing homogeneity, were conducted. RESULTS: First, we examined the average effect size for one primary eating disorder related outcome from each of the 24 studies. There was no association between duration and treatment outcome (r = .05, 95% CI: -.03:.13), with high heterogeneity. Second, we conducted three sub-group analyses to explore possible sources of heterogeneity (diagnosis: anorexia nervosa versus bulimia nervosa; nature of the outcome: binary versus continuous; or type of outcome: binary indicator of recovery, eating disorder psychopathology, weight gain). There was no significant moderation or associations between duration and outcome (ranging from .02-.08), with low to medium heterogeneity. Third, two stand-alone analyses examined outcomes related to weight gain (n = 8) and eating disorder psychopathology (n = 5), with nonsignificant rs of .23/-.06, respectively. High levels of heterogeneity were present. DISCUSSION: Duration did not influence treatment outcome across any of our meta-analyses. Increasing homogeneity and power will allow more stable estimates of the impact of duration on outcome to be calculated; to this end, future treatment studies should include outcome related to weight gain (anorexia nervosa) and improvements in eating disorder psychopathology.",2020,Nov,Int J Eat Disord,53,11,1761-1773,,10.1002/eat.23373,32856329,#111,Radunz 2020,,Longer term outcomes,
The association between eating disorders and perfectionism in adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Stackpole R; Greene D; Bills E; Egan SJ,"OBJECTIVE: Dimensions of perfectionism are associated with the onset and maintenance of eating disorder pathology in both clinical and non-clinical samples. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between perfectionism and eating disorders in adults. METHOD: A literature search was conducted using the PsycINFO, Medline, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science and ProQuest databases. Ninety-five studies met the inclusion criteria and included a total sample of 32,840 participants (clinical eating disorder diagnosis N = 2414, non-clinical N = 30,428). Correlation coefficients (r) for the association between eating disorders and perfectionism were pooled. A meta-analysis to determine the association between two dimensions of perfectionism and eating disorder symptoms was conducted. Subgroup analyses were conducted with studies using clinical samples, and studies using the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire. RESULTS: The pooled effect size for the association between perfectionistic concerns and eating disorder symptoms was r = 0.33 [0.30, 0.37]; and r = 0.20 [0.14, 0.25] for the association between perfectionistic strivings and eating disorder symptoms. In the clinical subgroup analyses the effect sizes were r = 0.40 [0.22, 0.58]; and r = 0.35 [0.26, 0.44] respectively. Medium to high heterogeneity was identified across all subgroup analyses and a significant level of publication bias was also identified. DISCUSSION: The findings indicate both perfectionistic strivings and perfectionistic concerns have significant associations with eating disorders, and further support the argument that both dimensions of perfectionism are important factors in the prevention and treatment of eating disorders.",2023,Aug,Eat Behav,50,,101769,,10.1016/j.eatbeh.2023.101769,37327637,#114,Stackpole 2023,,ED phenomenology; Mixed ED sample,
Pharmacological treatment of acute-phase anorexia nervosa: Evidence from randomized controlled trials.,Cassioli E; Sensi C; Mannucci E; Ricca V; Rotella F,"BACKGROUND: Anorexia nervosa (AN) is the psychiatric disorder with the highest mortality rate, with a standard mortality ratio of 5.86. Despite the large use of psychotropic drugs in the clinical setting, Food and Drug Administration has not approved any psychoactive treatment for AN. AIMS: The aim of this study was to perform an updated systematic review and meta-analysis of published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating psychopharmacological treatment in acute-phase AN. METHODS: The present paper follows the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. An extensive literature search was performed. All RCTs enrolling patients with acute-phase AN, comparing at least one psychotropic drug with another drug, placebo, treatment-as-usual or no treatment were included. The main outcome was the effect of psychoactive drugs on body mass index (BMI); data on psychopathological outcomes were also collected when available. RESULTS: A total of 19 RCTs met all specified criteria. Of these, 11 were excluded from quantitative analyses. Of the eight studies included in the meta-analyses, five reported data on BMI, showing no significant difference between olanzapine and placebo for weight recovery. No significant result was found for AN psychopathology, depressive and anxious symptoms for any of the molecules studied. CONCLUSIONS: RCTs published in this field display methodological biases, low sample sizes and short follow-up periods. Further research efforts are needed in this field as no evidence has been demonstrated for the use of any psychotropic drug in acute-phase AN neither for weight recovery, nor for comorbid psychiatric symptoms.",2020,Aug,J Psychopharmacol,34,8,864-873,,10.1177/0269881120920453,32448045,#115,Cassioli 2020,,Anorexia; Pharmacotherapy,
Efficacy of Eating Disorder Focused Family Therapy for Adolescents With Anorexia Nervosa: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,Austin A; Anderson AG; Lee J; Vander Steen H; Savard C; Bergmann C; Singh M; Devoe D; Gorrell S; Patten S; Le Grange D; Dimitropoulos G,"OBJECTIVE: To systematically review and evaluate the efficacy of eating disorder focused family therapy (FT-ED) in comparison to all other forms of psychotherapy for children and adolescents with anorexia nervosa. A secondary aim is to assess the relative efficacy of different variations of FT-ED (e.g., shorter vs. longer dose, parent-focused). METHODS: A search with relevant terms was systematically conducted on four databases. Twenty-three publications across 18 randomized controlled trials met inclusion criteria. Outcomes of interest included variables related to weight, eating psychopathology, and remission status. Study quality was assessed, and data were extracted by two independent researchers. RESULTS: Adolescents receiving FT-ED gained significantly more weight by the end of treatment in comparison to those receiving individual psychotherapy. FT-ED that was delivered just to parents or to parents and child separately offered preferable weight outcomes and rates of recovery at the end of treatment in comparison to conjoint FT-ED. No other outcomes tested in the meta-analysis were statistically significant at the end of treatment or follow-up. DISCUSSION: Currently available data suggest the use of FT-ED in its conjoint or separated/parent focused format is the best outpatient treatment option for adolescents with anorexia nervosa when immediate weight gain is paramount. The variability of outcome measurement, including the tools used and timepoints chosen, limit comparison among no more than a handful of studies. The field would benefit from the standardization of measurement and reporting guidelines for future clinical trials.

Association of serotonin receptor gene polymorphisms with anorexia nervosa: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Bevilacqua A; Santini F; La Porta D; Cimino S,"PURPOSE: Several studies have investigated the association between anorexia nervosa and polymorphisms of genes regulating serotonin neurotransmission, with a focus on the rs6311 polymorphism of 5-HTR2A. However, inconsistent results of these studies and conflicting conclusions of existing meta-analyses complicate the understanding of a possible association. We have updated these results and evaluated the involvement of other serotonin receptor gene polymorphisms in anorexia nervosa. METHODS: Adhering to PRISMA guidelines, we have searched studies on anorexia nervosa and serotonin-regulating genes published from 1997 to 2022, selected those concerning receptor genes and meta-analyzed the results from twenty candidate gene studies on the 5-HTR2A rs6311 polymorphism and the 5-HTR2C rs6318 polymorphism. RESULTS: Present analyses reveal an association for the 5-HTR2A rs6311 polymorphism, with G and A alleles, across eighteen studies (2049 patients, 2877 controls; A vs. G allele, Odds Ratio = 1.24; 95% Confidence Interval = 1.06-1.47; p = 0.009). However, after geographic subgrouping, an association emerged only in a Southern European area, involving five studies (722 patients, 773 controls; A vs. G allele, Odds Ratio = 1.82; 95% Confidence Interval = 1.41-2.37; p < 0.00001). No association was observed for the 5-HTR2C rs6318 polymorphism across three studies. CONCLUSIONS: To date, the involvement in the pathophysiology of anorexia nervosa of the 5-HTR2A rs6311 polymorphism appears limited to a specific genetic and/or environmental context, while that of the 5-HTR2C rs6318 polymorphism seems excluded. Genome-wide association studies and epigenetic studies will likely offer deeper insights of genetic and environmental factors possibly contributing to the disorder.

Systematic review and meta-analysis of risk of gestational diabetes in women with preconception mental disorders.,Wilson CA; Newham J; Rankin J; Ismail K; Simonoff E; Reynolds RM; Stoll N; Howard LM,"There is a well-established bidirectional association between Type 2 diabetes and mental disorder and emerging evidence for an increased risk of perinatal mental disorder in women with gestational diabetes (GDM). However, the relation between mental disorder prior to pregnancy and subsequent risk of GDM remains relatively unexplored. This is a systematic review and meta-analysis of the risk of GDM in women with a range of preconception mental disorders. Peer-reviewed literature measuring odds of GDM and preconception mood, anxiety, psychotic and eating disorders was systematically reviewed. Risk of bias was assessed using a checklist. Two independent reviewers were involved. 22 observational studies met inclusion criteria; most were retrospective cohorts from English speaking, high income countries. 14 studies were at high risk of bias. There was evidence for an increased risk of GDM in women with schizophrenia (pooled OR 2.44; 95% CI 1.17,5.1; 5 studies) and a reduced risk of GDM in women with anorexia nervosa (pooled OR 0.63; 95% CI 0.49,0.80; 5 studies). There was some limited evidence of an increased risk in women with bipolar disorder. There was no evidence for an association with preconception depression or bulimia nervosa on meta-analysis. There were insufficient studies on anxiety disorders for meta-analysis. This review indicates that there is not a significant risk of GDM associated with many preconception mental disorders but women with psychotic disorders represent a group uniquely vulnerable to GDM. Early detection and management of GDM could improve physical and mental health outcomes for these women and their children.",2022,May,J Psychiatr Res,149,,293-306,,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.03.013,35320739,#119,Wilson 2022,,ED is a sub-group analysis only,
Comorbidities in Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Across the Lifespan: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,Sharma E; Sharma LP; Balachander S; Lin B; Manohar H; Khanna P; Lu C; Garg K; Thomas TL; Au ACL; Selles RR; Højgaard DRMA; Skarphedinsson G; Stewart SE,"Comorbidities are seen with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) across the lifespan. Neurodevelopmental comorbidities are common in young children, followed by mood, anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive related disorders (OCRDs) in children, adolescents and adults, and neurological and degenerative disorders in the elderly. Understanding comorbidity prevalence and patterns has clinical and research implications. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on comorbidities in OCD across the lifespan, with the objective to, first, estimate age-wise pattern and prevalence of comorbidities with OCD and, second, to examine associations of demographic (age at assessment, gender distribution) and clinical characteristics (age of onset, illness severity) with comorbidities. Four electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and PsycINFO) were searched using predefined search terms for articles published between 1979 and 2020. Eligible studies, across age, reported original findings on comorbidities and had an OCD sample size of ≥100. We excluded studies that did not use standardised diagnostic assessments, or that excluded patients on the basis of comorbidity. We adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. The review protocol has been registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews. A comorbidity rate of 69% was found in a pooled sample of more than 15,000 individuals. Mood disorders (major depressive disorder), anxiety disorders (generalised anxiety disorder), neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) and OCRDs were the commonest comorbidities. Anxiety disorders prevailed in children, mood disorders in adults, whereas NDDs were similarly prevalent. Higher comorbidity with any psychiatric illness, NDDs, and severe mental disorders was seen in males, vs. females. Illness severity was inversely associated with rates for panic disorder, tic disorders, OCRDs, obsessive compulsive personality disorder, and anorexia nervosa. This systematic review and meta-analysis provides base rates for comorbidities in OCD across the lifespan. This has implications for comprehensive clinical evaluation and management planning. The high variability in comorbidity rates suggests the need for quality, multi-centric, large studies, using prospective designs.

Growth factors in anorexia nervosa: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cross-sectional and longitudinal data.,Keeler JL; Robinson L; Keeler-Schäffeler R; Dalton B; Treasure J; Himmerich H,"OBJECTIVES: Growth factors are signalling molecules that play roles in the survival, proliferation, migration, and differentiation of cells. Studies have found alterations in specific growth factors in anorexia nervosa (AN). METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis examined articles from three databases, measuring growth factors in AN cross-sectionally and longitudinally, and in recovered AN (rec-AN) cross-sectionally. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and insulin growth factor-I (IGF-1) for cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. RESULTS: A total of 82 studies were included: 56 cross-sectional (BDNF: n = 15; IGF-1: n = 41) and 24 longitudinal (BDNF: n = 5; IGF-1: n = 19) were meta-analysed and 20 studies were narratively synthesised. In cross-sectional analyses, BDNF and IGF-1 were lower in AN compared to controls, and BDNF was marginally greater in rec-AN compared to controls. In longitudinal meta-analyses, BDNF and IGF-1 increased from baseline to follow-up. Cross-sectional subgroup analyses revealed no differences in BDNF between controls and AN binge-eating/purging subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: It is likely that the low BDNF and IGF-1 levels found in AN are consequences of starvation, which are reversible with weight restoration. The increase in BDNF and IGF-1 during therapeutic weight restoration might improve neuroplasticity, which is the basis of learning, and thus psychotherapeutic success.",2022,Oct,World J Biol Psychiatry,23,8,582-600,,10.1080/15622975.2021.2015432,34875968,#121,Keeler 2022,,Anorexia; medical aspects of ED,
Eating disorders among international migrants: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Siddiqi S; Akther A; Blair DL; Eccles H; Frangione B; Keeshan A; Nagi S; Colman I,"PURPOSE: Migrants may have elevated exposure to stressors, which can affect their physical and mental well-being. However, migrants often experience a healthy immigrant effect, the applicability of this phenomena to eating disorders is unknown. We aimed to synthesize the available literature and estimate a summary measure of prevalence odds ratio for eating disorders in migrant populations compared to local populations. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science with keywords on migration and eating disorders. Inclusion criteria involved using a validated eating disorder scale and having a comparator group. Two independent reviewers performed study screening and data extraction. The NIH Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies was used to assess risk of bias. Random-effects models of meta-analysis were applied to compare eating disorder prevalence between migrants and local populations. RESULTS: There were 10 studies included in our review (meta-analysis = 6, narrative synthesis = 4). Studies provided prevalence estimates for: any eating disorder, binge eating disorder, anorexia nervosa, and bulimia nervosa. Among studies with a diagnostic instrument, the pooled prevalence odds ratio (POR) between migrants and local populations for any eating disorder was 0.45 (95%CI: 0.35-0.59). However, a subgroup analysis of eating disorder instruments among studies using risk assessment tools demonstrated inconsistent findings, with both increases and decreases in prevalence. CONCLUSION: Migrants were found to have a lower prevalence of eating disorders compared to local populations, supporting the healthy immigrant hypothesis.

Meta-analysis on the long-term effectiveness of psychological and medical treatments for binge-eating disorder.,Hilbert A; Petroff D; Herpertz S; Pietrowsky R; Tuschen-Caffier B; Vocks S; Schmidt R,"OBJECTIVE: Long-term effectiveness is a critical aspect of the clinical utility of a treatment; however, a meta-analytic evaluation of psychological and medical treatments for binge-eating disorder (BED), including weight loss treatments, is outstanding. This meta-analysis sought to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the long-term effectiveness in diverse treatments for BED regarding a range of clinically relevant outcomes. METHOD: Based on a systematic search up to February 2018, 114 published and unpublished randomized-controlled (RCTs), nonrandomized, and uncontrolled treatment studies, totaling 8,862 individuals with BED (DSM-IV, DSM-5), were identified and analyzed using within-group random-effect modeling. RESULTS: Effectiveness (regarding binge-eating episodes and abstinence, eating disorder and general psychopathology) up to 12 months following treatment was demonstrated for psychotherapy, structured self-help treatment, and combined treatment, while the results regarding body weight reduction were inconsistent. These results were confirmed in sensitivity analyses with RCTs on the most common treatments-cognitive-behavioral therapy and self-help treatment based on this approach. Follow-up intervals longer than 12 months were rarely reported, mostly supporting the long-term effectiveness of psychotherapy. Few follow-up data were available for pharmacotherapy, and behavioral and self-help weight loss treatment, while follow-up data were lacking for pharmacological and surgical weight loss treatment. Study quality varied widely. DISCUSSION: This comprehensive meta-analysis demonstrated the medium-term effectiveness of psychotherapy, structured self-help treatment, and combined treatment for patients with BED, and supported the long-term effectiveness of psychotherapy.

Effects of intranasal oxytocin in food intake and craving: A meta-analysis of clinical trials.,Chen CY; Chiang YC; Kuo TC; Tam KW; Loh EW,"OBJECTIVE: A rise of endogenous oxytocin (OT) is associated with anxiety and meal size reduction, and the effects of intranasal OT (INOT) have been examined in the management of food intake and craving. However, the discrepancy INOT effects in different disease populations are not entirely clear. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Updated systematic review and meta-analysis. By systematically searching the PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library, we obtained 12 controlled trials. We performed meta-analyses to examine food intake, craving, anxiety or stress reduction on INOT administration, using standard mean difference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) and a random-effects model. RESULTS: This study examined 12 trials with 266 non-psychiatric and 157 psychiatric participants. The pooled results showed that single-dose INOT induced a significant lesser food intake in non-psychiatric subjects (SMD: -0.66 [95% CI: -1.18, -0.14]), but no effects was found in anorexia nervosa (AN) (SMD: 0.17 [95% CI: -0.32, 0.66]), bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge eating disorder (BED) (SMD: -0.41 [95% CI: -0.94, 0.11]), and schizophrenia (SMD: 0.04 [95% CI: -0.94, 1.02] subjects.

Oral health status of individuals with eating disorders: Systematic review and meta-analysis.,Chan CCK; Chen AM; Lam PPY,"OBJECTIVES: This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates the oral health status of individuals diagnosed with eating disorders (EDs) compared to healthy controls. DATA & SOURCES: Electronic database search was conducted in five databases. Two independent reviewers carried out screening, data extraction, risk of bias assessment, sensitivity analysis, subgroup analysis (by type of eating disorder), and certainty of evidence grading with Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE). Assessed oral health outcomes included dental caries, erosion, oral hygiene, periodontal status, salivary flow, pH and composition, myofascial pain, bruxism, malocclusion, oral lesions, dentine hypersensitivity, and oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL). STUDY SELECTION: The literature search yielded 2,322 articles. Thirty-three articles were included in the present review. CONCLUSION: Individuals with EDs had poorer oral health outcomes compared to healthy controls, although the effect estimates are uncertain due to very low certainty of evidence. Dental caries and gingival inflammation severity, and prevalence of dental erosion, myofascial pain, malocclusion, oral lesions, and dentine sensitivity were higher amongst individuals with EDs compared to healthy controls. They also had lower salivary flow and pH, which are risk factors for oral diseases. No significant difference in bruxism was noted and inconclusive results were obtained for oral hygiene and periodontal status. Dental professionals may identify signs of EDs during routine appointments and may play an important role in the early referral and prompt management of patients with EDs.

A meta-analysis of disordered eating and its association with self-criticism and self-compassion.,Paranjothy SM; Wade TD,"OBJECTIVE: Future treatments for eating disorders (ED) need to be enhanced by targeting maintaining mechanisms. Literature suggests self-criticism and self-critical perfectionism act as key mechanisms exacerbating ED, and self-compassion protects against self-criticism. This meta-analysis examines associations between self-criticism and self-critical perfectionism on disordered eating (DE), and reviews how self-compassion and self-criticism relate to each other with respect to DE. METHOD: Searches across three databases yielded 135 studies across 42,952 participants. Heterogeneity, publication bias, and quality assessments were analyzed. Moderation analyses between self-criticism measures, self-compassion measures, between clinical and nonclinical samples, and between cross-sectional and experimental studies were also conducted. RESULTS: Random-effects models showed a medium positive link between self-criticism and DE (r = .37), and 10 subgroups pertaining to various measures of self-criticism utilized in literature showed small to large positive links with DE (r = .20-.52). Preliminary evidence also suggests negative relationships between self-compassion and DE (r = -.40 to -.43) and negative relationships between self-compassion and self-criticism (r = -.04 to -.88). DISCUSSION: Greater levels of self-criticism is linked with greater levels of DE and reduced levels of self-compassion, suggesting a need to tackle self-criticism and nurture self-compassion in standard treatments for ED. Understanding these interactions better in conjunction with dismantling intervention studies can help develop more effective and efficient interventions targeting self-criticism and self-compassion for people with DE. PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Higher levels of self-criticism are linked with higher levels of DE and lower self-compassion. Self-compassion interventions could be more effective and efficient in reducing ED symptoms if self-criticism is tackled early in such treatments.",2024,Mar,Int J Eat Disord,57,3,473-536,,10.1002/eat.24166,38366726,#131,Paranjothy 2024,Sasha Gorrell (2025-07-22 14:00:51)(Select): subgroup analyses include a separate clinical vs. non-clinical comparison; ,ED is a sub-group analysis only,

Recent research has focused on evaluating its effectiveness in treating patients with anorexia nervosa (AN). This systematic review and meta-analysis examined the impact of TMS on patients with AN and evaluated any potential adverse effects. METHODS: We conducted search according to PRISMA guidelines and comprehensively analyzed data from multiple databases, including Pubmed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library, up to September 13th. Statistical analysis utilized the Comprehensive Meta-analysis software version 3.0. RESULTS: The systematic review encompassed 17 studies, with nine undergoing meta-analyses. The primary target for TMS was the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, with two studies targeting the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, one targeting the insula and one targeting the inferior parietal lobe. The findings revealed a significant increase in body mass index (BMI) following TMS (SMD: -0.025, 95% CI: -0.0505 to -0.005, P-value = 0.045). Additionally, the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) score was quantitatively reported in six studies, which permitted its inclusion in the meta-analysis. The analysis exhibited a significant decrease in EDE-Q score after TMS (SMD: 0.634, 95% CI: 0.349-0.919, P-value < 0.001). Subgroup analysis based on TMS session duration indicated that the effect size of TMS on EDE-Q score is more pronounced when the session duration exceeds 20 min.

During cognitive-related tasks, patients with AN also showed increased activity in the left superior parietal gyrus, right middle temporal gyrus, but decreased activity in the MCC. Additionally, patients with AN showed increased activity bilaterally in the cerebellum, MCC, and decreased activity bilaterally in the bilateral precuneus/PCC, right middle temporal gyrus, left ACC when they viewed food images. During emotion-related tasks, patients with AN showed increased activity in the left cerebellum, but decreased activity bilaterally in the striatum, right mPFC, and right superior parietal gyrus. Patients with AN also showed increased activity in the right striatum and decreased activity in the right inferior temporal gyrus and bilaterally in the mPFC during body-related tasks. The present meta-analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the patterns of brain activity evoked by task stimuli, thereby augmenting the current comprehension of the pathophysiology in AN.",2023,Sep,Psychiatry Res,327,,115358,,10.1016/j.psychres.2023.115358,37544086,#136,Zhong 2023,,Anorexia; Neurocognition; Neuroimaging,
Morbid exercise behaviour and eating disorders: A meta-analysis.,Alcaraz-Ibáñez M; Paterna A; Sicilia Á; Griffiths MD,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: This study examined the relationship between self-reported symptoms of morbid exercise behaviour (MEB) and eating disorders (ED) using meta-analytic techniques. METHODS: We systematically searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, SciELO and Scopus. Random effects models were used to compute pooled effect sizes estimates (r). The robustness of the summarized estimates was examined through sensitivity analyses by removing studies one at a time. RESULTS: Sixty-six studies comprising 135 effect-sizes (N = 21,816) were included. The results revealed: (a) small-sized relationship in the case of bulimic symptoms (r = 0.19), (b) small- (r = 0.28) to medium-sized relationships (r = 0.41) in the case of body/eating concerns, and (c) medium-sized relationships in the case of overall ED symptoms (r = 0.35) and dietary restraint (r = 0.42). Larger effect sizes were observed in the case of overall ED symptoms in clinical, younger, and thinner populations, as well as when employing a continuously-scored instrument for assessing ED or the Compulsive Exercise Test for assessing MEB. Larger effect sizes were also found in female samples when the ED outcome was dietary restraint. CONCLUSIONS: The identified gaps in the literature suggest that future research on the topic may benefit from: (a) considering a range of clinical (in terms of diagnosed ED) and non-clinical populations from diverse exercise modalities, (b) addressing a wide range of ED symptomatology, and (c) employing longitudinal designs that clarify the temporal direction of the relationship under consideration.",2020,Jun,J Behav Addict,9,2,206-224,,10.1556/2006.2020.00027,32644935,#137,Alcaraz-Ibáñez 2020,,,
Efficacy and safety of topiramate in binge eating disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Nourredine M; Jurek L; Auffret M; Iceta S; Grenet G; Kassai B; Cucherat M; Rolland B,"BACKGROUND: To assess the efficacy and safety of topiramate in treating binge eating disorder (BED), using a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available randomized clinical trials (RCTs). METHODS: The RCTs assessing topiramate vs placebo with or without adjunctive psychotherapy in BED were reviewed using a systematic search in the PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Cochrane Database of Systematic Review, and ClinicalTrials.gov search Websites, from inception to November 2019. Main outcomes were the changes in binge frequency, quality of life, and weight, respectively. Effect estimates were pooled using random-effect models and presented as risk ratios (RRs) or mean differences (MDs) and their 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Data extraction was performed by two independent reviewers. RESULTS: Three studies were eligible for inclusion, involving 528 BED patients. Topiramate was found to be significantly more efficacious than placebo in reducing: (a) the number of binge episodes per week (MD = -1.31; 95% CI = -2.58 to -0.03; I2 = 94%); (b) the number of binge days per week (MD = -0.98; 95% CI = -1.80 to -0.16; I2 = 94%); and (c) weight (MD = -4.91 kg; 95% CI = -6.42 to -3.41; I2 = 10%). However, participants in the topiramate groups withdrew significantly more frequently for safety reasons, relative to placebo participants (RR = 1.90; 95% CI = 1.13-3.18, I2 = 0%). CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary findings support a possible efficacy of topiramate for the treatment of BED, even if safety concerns could limit the practical use of this treatment in BED subjects.",2021,Oct,CNS Spectr,26,5,459-467,,10.1017/S1092852920001613,32641176,#138,Nourredine 2021,,Binge-eating disorder; Pharmacotherapy,

This study aims to analyze the relation between bariatric surgery and the development and recurrence of eating disorders. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A literature review was carried out on 15 November 2020. Fourteen studies that met the eligibility criteria were included for qualitative synthesis, and 7 studies for meta-analysis. RESULTS: The prevalence of eating disorders in the postoperative period was 7.83%, based on the 7 studies in the meta-analysis. Binge eating disorder alone was 3.81%, which was the most significant factor, and addressed in 6 of these studies.

A meta-analytic investigation of grey matter differences in anorexia nervosa and autism spectrum disorder.,Sader M; Williams JHG; Waiter GD,"Recent research reports Anorexia Nervosa (AN) to be highly dependent upon neurobiological function. Some behaviours, particularly concerning food selectivity are found in populations with both Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and AN, and there is a proportionally elevated number of anorexic patients exhibiting symptoms of ASD. We performed a systematic review of structural MRI literature with the aim of identifying common structural neural correlates common to both AN and ASD. Across 46 ASD publications, a meta-analysis of volumetric differences between ASD and healthy controls revealed no consistently affected brain regions. Meta-analysis of 23 AN publications revealed increased volume within the orbitofrontal cortex and medial temporal lobe, and adult-only AN literature revealed differences within the genu of the anterior cingulate cortex. The changes are consistent with alterations in flexible reward-related learning and episodic memory reported in neuropsychological studies. There was no structural overlap between ASD and AN. Findings suggest no consistent neuroanatomical abnormality associated with ASD, and evidence is lacking to suggest that reported behavioural similarities between those with AN and ASD are due to neuroanatomical structural similarities.",2022,Sep,Eur Eat Disord Rev,30,5,560-579,,10.1002/erv.2915,35526083,#141,Sader 2022,,Longer term outcomes; Neuroimaging; psychological comorbidities,
A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Finds Increased Blood Levels of All Forms of Ghrelin in Both Restricting and Binge-Eating/Purging Subtypes of Anorexia Nervosa.,Seidel M; Markmann Jensen S; Healy D; Dureja A; Watson HJ; Holst B; Bulik CM; Sjögren JM,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe psychiatric condition associated with high mortality and chronicity. The hunt for state, trait, subtyping, and prognostic biomarkers is ongoing and the orexigenic hormone ghrelin and its different forms, acyl ghrelin and desacyl ghrelin, have been proposed to be increased in AN, especially in the restrictive subtype. A systematic literature search was performed using established databases up to 30 November 2020. Forty-nine studies met inclusion criteria for cross-sectional and longitudinal meta-analyses on total ghrelin, acyl ghrelin, and desacyl ghrelin. All forms of ghrelin were increased in the acute stage of anorexia nervosa during fasting compared to healthy controls. Previous notions on differences in ghrelin levels between AN subtypes were not supported by current data. In addition, a significant decrease in total ghrelin was observed pre-treatment to follow-up. However, total ghrelin levels at follow-up were still marginally elevated compared to healthy controls, whereas for acyl ghrelin, no overall effect of treatment was observed. Due to heterogeneity in follow-up designs and only few data on long-term recovered patients, longitudinal results should be interpreted with caution. While the first steps towards a biomarker in acute AN have been completed, the value of ghrelin as a potential indicator of treatment success or recovery status or its use in subtype differentiation are yet to be established.",2021,Feb,Nutrients,13,2,,,10.3390/nu13020709,33672297,#143,Seidel 2021,,medical aspects of ED,
Transdiagnostic risk of mental disorders in offspring of affected parents: a meta-analysis of family high-risk and registry studies.,Uher R; Pavlova B; Radua J; Provenzani U; Najafi S; Fortea L; Ortuño M; Nazarova A; Perroud N; Palaniyappan L; Domschke K; Cortese S; Arnold PD; Austin JC; Vanyukov MM; Weissman MM; Young AH; Hillegers MHJ; Danese A; Nordentoft M; Murray RM; Fusar-Poli P,"The offspring of parents with mental disorders are at increased risk for developing mental disorders themselves. The risk to offspring may extend transdiagnostically to disorders other than those present in the parents. The literature on this topic is vast but mixed. To inform targeted prevention and genetic counseling, we performed a comprehensive, PRISMA 2020-compliant meta-analysis. We systematically searched the literature published up to September 2022 to retrieve original family high-risk and registry studies reporting on the risk of mental disorders in offspring of parents with any type of mental disorder. We performed random-effects meta-analyses of the relative risk (risk ratio, RR) and absolute risk (lifetime, up to the age at assessment) of mental disorders, defined according to the ICD or DSM. Cumulative incidence by offspring age was determined using meta-analytic Kaplan-Meier curves. We measured heterogeneity with the I(2) statistic, and risk of bias with the Quality In Prognosis Studies (QUIPS) tool. Sensitivity analyses addressed the impact of study design (family high-risk vs. registry) and specific vs. transdiagnostic risks. Transdiagnosticity was appraised with the TRANSD criteria. We identified 211 independent studies that reported data on 3,172,115 offspring of parents with psychotic, bipolar, depressive, disruptive, attention-deficit/hyperactivity, anxiety, substance use, eating, obsessive-compulsive, and borderline personality disorders, and 20,428,575 control offspring. The RR and lifetime risk of developing any mental disorder were 3.0 and 55% in offspring of parents with anxiety disorders; 2.6 and 17% in offspring of those with psychosis; 2.1 and 55% in offspring of those with bipolar disorder; 1.9 and 51% in offspring of those with depressive disorders; and 1.5 and 38% in offspring of those with substance use disorders. The offspring's RR and lifetime risk of developing the same mental disorder diagnosed in their parent were 8.4 and 32% for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; 5.8 and 8% for psychosis; 5.1 and 5% for bipolar disorder; 2.8 and 9% for substance use disorders; 2.3 and 14% for depressive disorders; 2.3 and 1% for eating disorders; and 2.2 and 31% for anxiety disorders. There were 37 significant transdiagnostic associations between parental mental disorders and the RR of developing a different mental disorder in the offspring. In offspring of parents with psychosis, bipolar and depressive disorder, the risk of the same disorder onset emerged at 16, 5 and 6 years, and cumulated to 3%, 19% and 24% by age 18; and to 8%, 36% and 46% by age 28. Heterogeneity ranged from 0 to 0.98, and 96% of studies were at high risk of bias. Sensitivity analyses restricted to prospective family high-risk studies confirmed the pattern of findings with similar RR, but with greater absolute risks compared to analyses of all study types. This study demonstrates at a global, meta-analytic level that offspring of affected parents have strongly elevated RR and lifetime risk of developing any mental disorder as well as the same mental disorder diagnosed in the parent. The transdiagnostic risks suggest that offspring of parents with a range of mental disorders should be considered as candidates for targeted primary prevention.",2023,Oct,World Psychiatry,22,3,433-448,,10.1002/wps.21147,37713573,#144,Uher 2023,,ED is a sub-group analysis only; Mixed ED sample,
Pathological eating behaviours and risk of retinopathy in diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Trott M; Driscoll R; Iraldo E; Pardhan S,"BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus can cause several long-term macrovascular and microvascular complications including nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy (DR). Several studies have reported positive associations between eating pathologies and DR; however, these studies have not been aggregated and sub-grouped into type of pathological eating behaviour, and the differences in risk according to type of eating behaviour is unknown. The aim of this review, therefore, was to aggregate risks of DR in populations with and without pathological eating behaviours, stratified according to eating behaviour. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. Major databases and grey literature were search from inception until 1/6/2021. Studies reporting the prevalence of pathological eating behaviours (against a control group with no pathological eating behaviours) in diabetic people with and without DR were included. Odds ratios were calculated from primary data. RESULTS: Seven studies with eight independent outcomes with a total of 1162 participants were included. The odds ratio of DR in the total pooled analysis was 2.94 (95%CI 1.86-4.64; p = <0.001; I(2) = 29.59). Two types of eating behaviour yielded enough data for sub-group analysis. Eating disorder not otherwise specified yielded an odds ratio of 2.73 (95%CI 1.81-4.10; p = <0.001; I(2) = 0.00), and binge eating disorder yielded an non-significant odds ratio of 0.92 (95%CI 0.31-2.77; p = 0.887;I(2) = 0.00). DISCUSSION: The likelihood of DR increases almost three times in the presence of pathological eating behaviours. More studies are required to confirm this in clinical populations stratified by eating disorder. Practitioners working with people with diabetes should closely monitor eating behaviours to preclude this risk.

The efficacy of internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for adult binge spectrum eating disorders: A meta-analysis.,Zhong J; Zhang Y; Sun Y; Wang Q; Dong G; Li X,"OBJECTIVE: Internet-Based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (iCBT) is an innovative modality of cognitive-behavioral intervention that presents a promising therapeutic strategy for individuals diagnosed with binge spectrum eating disorders. This study employed a meta-analysis methodology to assess the clinical effectiveness and acceptability of iCBT. METHODS: We conducted searches in databases such as PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO, collecting literature that met the inclusion criteria until August 5, 2023. RESULTS: A comprehensive analysis was conducted, encompassing a total of 11 randomized controlled studies that satisfied the predetermined criteria for inclusion. The summary results demonstrated that iCBT could significantly improve the pathological features related to eating in patients with binge spectrum eating disorders and also significantly reduce the frequency of binge episodes. Additionally, iCBT could ameliorate the depressive and anxious emotions of patients with binge spectrum eating disorders and boost their self-esteem. Furthermore, a notable disparity in dropout rates was seen in comparison to the control group. LIMITATION: Heterogeneity across studies，limitations of self-assessment scales and potential publication bias. CONCLUSION: iCBT can effectively assist patients with binge spectrum eating disorders in improving clinical symptoms.

The Efficacy of eHealth Interventions for the Treatment of Adults Diagnosed With Full or Subthreshold Binge Eating Disorder: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,Moghimi E; Davis C; Rotondi M,"BACKGROUND: There has been a recent rise in the use of eHealth treatments for a variety of psychological disorders, including eating disorders. OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials is the first to evaluate the efficacy of eHealth interventions specifically for the treatment of binge eating disorder (characterized by compulsive overconsumption of food, in a relatively short period, and without compensatory behaviors such as purging or fasting). METHODS: A search on the electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, MEDLINE, and CINAHL was conducted for randomized controlled trials that compared the efficacy of eHealth treatment interventions with waitlist controls. RESULTS: From the databases searched, 3 studies (298 participants in total) met the inclusion criteria. All interventions were forms of internet-based guided cognitive behavioral therapy. The results of the analysis demonstrated that when compared with waitlist controls, individuals enrolled in eHealth interventions experienced a reduction in objective binge episodes (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.77, 95% CI -1.38 to -0.16) and eating disorder psychopathology (SMD -0.71, 95% CI -1.20 to -0.22), which included shape (SMD -0.61, 95% CI -1.01 to -0.22) and weight concerns (SMD -0.91, 95% CI -1.33 to -0.48). There was no significant difference in BMI between the eHealth interventions and controls (SMD -0.01, 95% CI -0.40 to 0.39).

Multi-family therapy for eating disorders across the lifespan: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Zinser J; O'Donnell N; Hale L; Jones CJ,"Eating disorders (EDs) have an estimated prevalence rate of 1%-5% across Europe. Effective adjunct interventions are needed to support the 20%-40% of families whose recovery requires additional support to first line approaches. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to establish whether multi-family therapy (MFT) improves the physical and psychological health of patients and family members. Searches were conducted in PsycINFO, MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Library in March 2021. 15 studies (850 patients) met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis demonstrated MFT resulted in significant benefits in weight gain, ED symptoms, patients' and parents' depression symptoms, and parents' negative experiences of caregiving. However, significant improvements were only evident when comparisons were drawn before and after the intervention; these dissipated when MFT was compared to another intervention. There was no evidence MFT improves family functioning, positive aspects of caregiving, nor patient and parental anxiety. Intervention completion rates ranged from 86% to 100% indicating a high level of acceptability. Studies varied with regard to intervention length and structure, follow-up period, and outcome measures utilised; most were rated as moderate or weak in methodological quality.

Two decades of mindfulness-based interventions for binge eating: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Grohmann D; Laws KR,"OBJECTIVE: Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are being increasingly used as interventions for eating disorders including binge eating. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess two decades of research on the efficacy of MBIs in reducing binge eating severity. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane Library for trials assessing the use of MBIs to treat binge eating severity in both clinical and non-clinical samples. The systematic review and meta-analysis was pre-registered at PROSPERO (CRD42020182395). RESULTS: Twenty studies involving 21 samples (11 RCT and 10 uncontrolled samples) met inclusion criteria. Random effects meta-analyses on the 11 RCT samples (n = 618: MBIs n = 335, controls n = 283) showed that MBIs significantly reduced binge eating severity (g = -0.39, 95% CI -0.68, -0.11) at end of trial, but was not maintained at follow-up (g = -0.06, 95% CI, -0.31, 0.20, k = 5). No evidence of publication bias was detected. On the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool 2, trials were rarely rated at high risk of bias and drop-out rates did not differ between MBIs and control groups. MBIs also significantly reduced depression, and improved both emotion regulation and mindfulness ability. CONCLUSION: MBIs reduce binge eating severity at the end of trials.

Among the biological factors related to pathogenesis and maintenance of EDs, inflammation acquired growing scientific interest. This study aimed to assess the inflammatory profile of EDs, focusing on anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and including for the first time binge eating disorder. A comprehensive research of existing literature identified 51 eligible studies for meta-analysis, comparing levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), osteoprotegerin (OPG), soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (sRANKL), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and interleukin-10 (IL-10) between patients with EDs and healthy controls (HCs). The systematic review explored other inflammatory biomarkers of interest, which did not meet the meta-analysis criteria. Results revealed significantly elevated levels of TNF-α, OPG, sRANKL, and IL-1β in patients with EDs compared to HCs. Additionally, the results highlighted the heterogeneity of inflammatory state among patients with EDs, emphasizing the need for further research into the association between inflammatory biomarkers and psychopathological correlates.

METHOD: A systematic search was carried out in biomedical databases from January 2020 to January 2021. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies that used quantitative measures of ED symptoms and psychological distress during and after the COVID-19 confinement were included. RESULTS: A total of 26 studies met inclusion criteria (n = 3399, 85.7% female). The pooled prevalence of symptomatic deterioration in EDs was 65% (95% CI[48,81], k = 10). The pooled prevalence of increased weight in obesity was 52% (95% CI[25,78], k = 4). More than half of the participants experienced depression and anxiety. Moreover, at least 75% of the individuals with EDs reported shape and eating concerns, and increased thinking about exercising. However, the pooled analyses of longitudinal studies showed no significant differences from pre-pandemic levels to the first lockdown phase in Body Mass Index and ED symptoms, whereas only few studies suggested increased distress, particularly among individuals with anorexia nervosa.

Neural correlates associated with processing food stimuli in anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa: an activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis of fMRI studies.,Bronleigh M; Baumann O; Stapleton P,"PURPOSE: Various neurobiological models have utilised symptom categories to explore the underlying neural correlates in both anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN). The aim of this research was to investigate the brain activity patterns associated with viewing food stimuli in anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. METHODS: Electronic databases including PsycInfo and PubMed were systematically searched from data base inception until 1st of December 2020, identifying 14 suitable functional magnetic resonance imaging studies (fMRI), involving 470 participants. ALE meta-analysis was used to statistically analyse the overlap of activation foci from different fMRI studies in response to visual food stimuli. RESULTS: Comparing patients with AN with healthy control (HC), we detected hypoactivation in brain areas related to reward processing (i.e., amygdala and lentiform nucleus), and interoceptive processing (i.e., insula). In addition, patients with AN showed hyperactivations in cognitive control areas (i.e., prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex). In contrast, patients with BN exhibited hyperactivations in brain areas related to reward processing (i.e., lentiform nucleus), and interoceptive processing (i.e., insula). Furthermore, patients with BN showed hypoactivations in brain regions associated with cognitive control (i.e., prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex). CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows differing neural endotypes of the two types of eating disorders, that underpin their behavioural phenotypes.

Resting state heart rate variability in clinical and subthreshold disordered eating: A meta-analysis.,Watford TS; Braden A; O'Brien WH,"OBJECTIVE: Research has demonstrated mixed results regarding the direction of the association between vagal activation and disordered eating. The current meta-analysis examined studies testing the link between resting-state heart rate variability indices of vagal activation (vmHRV), and both clinical and subthreshold disordered eating. METHOD: A systematic search of the literature resulted in the inclusion of studies that were correlational (associations between HRV and disordered eating symptoms) and that examined group differences (e.g., control group vs. disordered eating group), for a total of 36 samples. RESULTS: Findings indicated a small but reliable association of vmHRV with disordered eating, r = 0.12, indicating greater vagal activation in individuals with disordered eating compared to those with little or no disordered eating behavior. Moderation analyses identified predictors of the vmHRV/disordered eating association. Bulimia nervosa was found to have a large, positive effect size with vmHRV, r = 0.60, which was significantly greater than all other types of disordered eating, Q (T) = 10.74, p = .047. Compared to subthreshold disordered eating, clinical eating disorders demonstrated significant, persistent increased vagal activation with a medium, reliable effect size, r = 25, Q(T) = 3.94, p = .045.

Medical instability in typical and atypical adolescent anorexia nervosa: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Brennan C; Illingworth S; Cini E; Bhakta D,"This review investigates the relationship between weight and risk of medical instability (specifically bradycardia, hypotension, hypothermia, and hypophosphatemia) in adolescents with typical and atypical anorexia nervosa. Atypical anorexia nervosa, listed as an example under the DSM-5 category of Other Specified Feeding and Eating Disorders (OSFED), describes patients who are not clinically underweight but otherwise meet criteria for anorexia nervosa. There is a lack of empirical evidence exploring medical complications in adolescents presenting with atypical anorexia nervosa. The small number of studies that do exist in this area indicate that medical instability exists across a range of weights, with weight loss being associated with increased medical risk, independent of underweight. The aim of this review was to collate and analyse results from available studies and identify indicators of medical risk in these two groups of adolescents with restrictive eating disorders. Studies were identified by systematic electronic search of medical databases, including PubMed and EMBASE. All studies investigated the relationship between weight and medical instability and included adolescents diagnosed with anorexia nervosa or atypical anorexia nervosa. One randomised controlled trial, five cohort studies and three chart reviews were included, with a total sample size of 2331 participants. Between 29 and 42% of participants presented with medical instability requiring hospitalisation, in the absence of underweight. Underweight adolescents were significantly more likely to have lower blood pressures (p < 0.0001) and bradycardia was significantly associated with greater weight loss (p < 0.05). There were no statistically significant associations found between degree of underweight and heart rate, temperature, or rate of weight loss (p = 0.31, p = 0.46 and p = 0.16, respectively). Adolescents that were less than 70% median body mass index were significantly more likely to have hypophosphatemia (p < 0.05). The findings of this review support the hypothesis that medical instability can occur across a range of weights in adolescent eating disorders, with rapid weight loss being an important indicator of increasing medical risk. Results were limited by the small number of existing studies that contained data for statistical analysis. Rapid weight loss should be considered as an important indicator of medical instability in adolescents presenting with both typical and atypical anorexia nervosa.",2023,Apr,J Eat Disord,11,1,58,,10.1186/s40337-023-00779-y,37024943,#163,Brennan 2023,,Anorexia; Medical complications,
Pharmacotherapy compared to placebo for people with Bulimia Nervosa: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Argyrou A; Lappas AS; Bakaloudi DR; Tsekitsidi E; Mathioudaki E; Michou N; Polyzopoulou Z; Christodoulou N; Papazisis G; Chourdakis M; Samara MT,"Bulimia Nervosa is a disorder with high rates of psychiatric and medical comorbidity and substantial societal costs. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy is considered the preferred treatment, but access can be problematic. Pharmacotherapy is more accessible but remains significantly underutilised. We aimed to assess the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of all available forms of pharmacotherapy for the treatment of bulimia nervosa. We conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and reference lists of relevant articles up until April 2023. The primary outcomes were remission and binge frequency. 52 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 3313 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, no significant difference was observed between drugs and placebo in terms of remission; however, the available data were limited. Notably, drugs, particularly antidepressants, demonstrated a significant reduction in the frequency of binge episodes compared to placebo. Antidepressants were also found to be more effective than placebo in terms of treatment response and other clinically meaningful outcomes. An important limitation is that few RCTs were available for individual drugs. Our findings provide evidence supporting the increased utilisation of pharmacotherapy in clinical practice and underscore the need for further research involving larger populations and a broader range of outcomes.",2023,Sep,Psychiatry Res,327,,115357,,10.1016/j.psychres.2023.115357,37562154,#165,Argyrou 2023,,Bulimia; Pharmacotherapy; Treatment,
Effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions on individuals with anorexia nervosa: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Gan JKE; Wu VX; Chow G; Chan JKY; Klainin-Yobas P,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to synthesize the best available evidence regarding the effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions on body mass index (BMI), body dissatisfaction, depression and anxiety among individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN). METHODS: Published studies in English were searched using seven databases (such as PubMed). Grey literature was searched using ProQuest and Scopus. Studies were screened, appraised and extracted by two independent reviewers. Meta-analysis was performed and standardized mean difference was used as an effect measure. Heterogeneity was determined by I(2) statistics and Cochran χ(2) test. Publication bias was appraised using funnel plots. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were also conducted. RESULTS: Nineteen RCTs from eight different countries were included in this review. Behavioral family system therapy (BFST) was found to enhance BMI while conjoint family therapy (CFT) was more effective in ameliorating depression. Studies implementing combined family and individual therapy and those with longer therapeutic durations produced larger effect sizes. CONCLUSION: This review provided evidence to support BSFT, CFT and combined family and individual therapy for adolescents with AN. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Healthcare professionals may offer the two interventions to adolescents with AN in clinical settings. Future research may further investigate the effectiveness of BSFT and CFT on BMI and depression.",2022,Jan,Patient Educ Couns,105,1,44-55,,10.1016/j.pec.2021.05.031,34059364,#172,GanJKE 2022,,Anorexia; Psychological treatment,
A meta-analysis of mortality rates in eating disorders: An update of the literature from 2010 to 2024.,Krug I; Liu S; Portingale J; Croce S; Dar B; Obleada K; Satheesh V; Wong M; Fuller-Tyszkiewicz M,"Elevated mortality rates have been reported in individuals with eating disorders (EDs). However, no meta-analysis in the past decade has provided an updated, comprehensive synthesis of mortality across all ED diagnoses while exploring potential moderating factors. We conducted a systematic search in four databases (PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science) from 2010 to 29 Oct 2024. Studies that reported standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) in individuals with a diagnosed ED (including formal diagnoses and self-reports) were included. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted to pool estimates across studies. Meta-regression was conducted to examine predictors of heterogeneity. Meta-analysis of SMRs of effect sizes revealed elevated mortality risk for individuals with an ED (regardless of ED subtype); weighted SMR = 3.39 (95 % CIs: 2.90, 3.95), p < .001, I(2) = 95.1 %, Q((df=73)) = 1492.39, p < .001. SMRs were highest for individuals with anorexia nervosa (5.21; k = 30), followed by eating disorder not otherwise specified (2.51; k = 8); bulimia nervisa (2.20; k = 18) and binge eating disorder (1.46; k = 3).

Pretreatment motivation and therapy outcomes in eating disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Sansfaçon J; Booij L; Gauvin L; Fletcher É; Islam F; Israël M; Steiger H,"OBJECTIVE: Identifying modifiable predictors of outcomes following treatment for eating disorders may help to tailor interventions to patients' individual needs, improve treatment efficacy, and develop new interventions. The goal of this meta-analysis was to quantify the association between pretreatment motivation and posttreatment changes in eating disorder symptomology. METHOD: We reviewed 196 longitudinal studies reporting on change on indices of overall eating-disorder symptomatology, weight gain, binge-eating, vomiting, anxiety/depression, and treatment adherence. Meta-analyses were performed using two complementary approaches: (a) combined probability analysis using the added Z's method; (b) effect size analyses. Using random-effect models, effect sizes were pooled when there were at least three studies with the same type of statistical design and reporting statistics on the same outcome. Heterogeneity in study outcome was evaluated using Q and I(2) statistics. Studies were reviewed qualitatively when the number of studies or reported data were insufficient to perform a meta-analysis. RESULTS: Forty-two articles were included. Although samples and treatments differed substantially across studies, results across studies were remarkably consistent. Both combined-probability and effect-size analyses indicated positive effects of pretreatment motivation on improvement in general eating-disorder symptoms (Cohen's r = .17), and an absence of effects on anxiety/depression symptoms. Remaining outcome indices were subject to selective reporting and/or small sample size bias. DISCUSSION: Our findings underscore the importance of incorporating treatment engagement approaches in the treatment of eating disorders. Optimal reporting of study findings and improving study quality would improve future efforts to obtain an in-depth understanding of the relationship between motivation and eating disorder symptoms.",2020,Dec,Int J Eat Disord,53,12,1879-1900,,10.1002/eat.23376,32954512,#176,Sansfaçon 2020,,Psychological treatment,
Prevalence of eating disorders and disordered eating in Western Asia: a systematic review and meta-Analysis.,Alfalahi M; Mahadevan S; Balushi RA; Chan MF; Saadon MA; Al-Adawi S; Qoronfleh MW,"This study aimed to systematically synthesize and appraise existing literature on the prevalence of eating disorders and disordered eating in Western Asia. A systematic literature search of major English and Arabic databases, i.e., PubMed/Medline, EMBASE, PsychInfo, Web of Science and Scopus (English), Al-Manhal (Arabic) and grey literature was done to obtain the prevalence of disordered eating and eating disorders in Western Asia. The literature search was conducted on June 12(th), 2020, and included papers from 1990-2020. Out of the 249 unduplicated original studies reviewed, 27 were included in the final meta-analysis. Data were then categorized according to the tools used to identify the presence of disordered eating or eating disorders. The pooled prevalence of disordered eating as solicited by both the Eating Attitudes Scale 26 and the Eating Attitudes Scale 40 (N = 11841) was 22.07%, the Sick, Control, One stone, Fat, Food Questionnaire (n = 3160) was 22.28% and the Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire (n = 425) was 7.95%. The pooled prevalence obtained from those studies using semi-structured interviews for anorexia nervosa (n = 118190) was 1.59%, bulimia nervosa (n = 118513) was 2.41% and the estimated prevalence of Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (EDNOS) (n = 118087) was 3.51%. Although the prevalence rate of eating disorders solicited using semi-structured interviews appeared to parallel the international range, the overall prevalence rate of disordered eating appeared to be slightly higher than the global rates of prevalence. A significant number of the suspected/detected cases of disordered eating appear to fulfill the criteria for EDNOS.

Rates of comorbid obsessive-compulsive disorder in eating disorders: A meta-analysis of the literature.,Mandelli L; Draghetti S; Albert U; De Ronchi D; Atti AR,"BACKGROUND: The high comorbidity between Eating Disorders (EDs) and Obsessive-Compulsive disorder (OCD) is well known, as well as its implications in terms of worse outcome and need to adapt treatment. Estimates of OCD comorbidities in EDs are variable in different studies and poorly informative for clinical purposes. In this study, we sought to derive more consistent estimates, taking into account potential methodological and sampling confounding factors. METHODS: We searched published studies reporting lifetime and current rates of comorbid OCD in ED samples based on recent diagnostic criteria. Comorbidity rates were meta-analyzed using a binary random effects model. Heterogeneity among the studies and publication bias were systematically checked. Potential confounding factors were tested by meta-regression analysis and adjusted by sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Globally, respectively 18% and 15% of all patients with an ED had a lifetime and current comorbidity with OCD. Rates were slightly higher in anorexia (19% and 14%) than in bulimia nervosa (13% and 9%), although only the current comorbid OCD was significantly higher in anorexia than in bulimia. Prospective follow-up studies provided considerably higher lifetime estimates (EDs 38%, anorexia 44%, bulimia 19%). LIMITATIONS: Temporal/causal relationship between ED and OCD could not be defined. CONCLUSIONS: OCD comorbidity in EDs is a relevant phenomenon, affecting almost one fifth of the patients in cross-sectional observations and up to nearly 40% in prospective follow-up studies. These data indicate the need for focused attention to non-food or body-shape related OCD symptoms, for better diagnostic and prognostic accuracy, and targeted treatment.",2020,Dec,J Affect Disord,277,,927-939,,10.1016/j.jad.2020.09.003,33065835,#181,Mandelli 2020,,psychological comorbidities,
Is constitutional thinness really different from anorexia nervosa? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Bailly M; Boscaro A; Pereira B; Féasson L; Boirie Y; Germain N; Galusca B; Courteix D; Thivel D; Verney J,"A growing interest in constitutional thinness has been observed in the last decades, but the publications however cover various fields of study and report equivocal results. The present work systematically reviewed any clinical trials enrolling participants with constitutional thinness and bibliographic researches were performed between December 2018 and June 2020. From a total of 1 212 records initially identified, 402 records were removed as duplicates, 381 articles were excluded based on titles or abstracts and 390 references were excluded against eligibility criteria. Thirty-nine articles were finally included in the systematic review. The results showed that constitutionally thin people seem to be underweight but not underfat and present a fat-free mass as blunted as anorexic patients, despite being a little less underweight. The meta-analysis confirmed that constitutionally thin people present normal energy intake and revealed a trend toward a higher resting metabolic rate to fat-free mass ratio which suggests a highly metabolic fat-free mass. Contrary to patients with anorexia nervosa, constitutionally thin people present normal levels of insulin-like growth factor 1, estradiol, growth hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone. An intermediate level of leptin between anorexic and control participants was however observed in constitutional thinness. While all the studies reported normal free triiodothyronine and cortisol levels in constitutionally thin individuals, a higher fasting free triiodothyronine level (p = 0.033) and a lower 24 h mean cortisol level (p = 0.005) were observed for the first time.

Attachment in individuals with eating disorders compared to community controls: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Jewell T; Apostolidou E; Sadikovic K; Tahta-Wraith K; Liston S; Simic M; Eisler I; Fonagy P; Yorke I,"OBJECTIVE: Individuals with eating disorders are known to have higher rates of insecure attachment compared to community controls, but the factors underlying this finding are poorly understood. We conducted the first meta-analysis comparing attachment in eating disorder samples compared to community controls that included quality assessment, publication bias and moderation analysis. METHOD: We pre-registered our meta-analysis (CRD42019146799) and followed PRISMA guidelines. We searched PsychINFO, Embase, Medline, CINAHL, and Scopus for publications. Attachment scores were extracted, and Cohen's d calculated for each study using a random effects model. RESULTS: In total, 35 studies were included in the meta-analysis and six studies were summarized in a narrative review. Eating disorder samples showed higher rates of insecure attachment compared to community controls, with a large effect size, across measurement methods and different attachment dimensions. Blinding of assessors moderated effect sizes for attachment interview studies, but no other moderators were significant. DISCUSSION: Risk of insecure attachment is elevated in individuals with eating disorders, albeit heterogeneity is high and largely unexplained. Clinicians may need to take this into account in their work, particularly given the association between attachment insecurity and challenges to therapeutic alliance. Future studies comparing eating disorder samples with community samples should control for general psychopathology. PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE: Attachment is a broad concept referring to a person's thoughts, feelings and behaviors in relation to close others. This systematic review and meta-analysis found that individuals with eating disorders are lower in attachment security than community controls, regardless of attachment construct or measurement approach. Attachment may be relevant in influencing eating disorder recovery, the development of therapeutic alliance, and potentially clinical outcomes, although more research is needed.",2023,May,Int J Eat Disord,56,5,888-908,,10.1002/eat.23922,36916409,#187,Jewell 2023,,ED phenomenology; Symptom correlates of ED,

To disentangle disorder-specific GMV correlates, we conducted a large-scale multidisorder meta-analysis using a novel approach that explicitly models co-occurring disorders. METHODS: We systematically reviewed voxel-based morphometry studies indexed in PubMed and Scopus up to January 2023 that compared adults with major mental disorders (anorexia nervosa, schizophrenia spectrum, anxiety, bipolar, major depressive, obsessive-compulsive, and posttraumatic stress disorders plus attention-deficit/hyperactivity, autism spectrum, and borderline personality disorders) with comparison participants. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We derived GMV correlates for each disorder using: 1) a multidisorder meta-analysis that accounted for all co-occurring mental disorders simultaneously and 2) separate standard meta-analyses for each disorder in which co-occurring disorders were ignored. We assessed the alterations' extent, intensity (effect size), and specificity (interdisorder correlations and transdiagnostic alterations) for both approaches. RESULTS: We included 433 studies (499 datasets) involving 19,718 patients and 16,441 comparison participants (51% female, ages 20-67 years). We provide GMV correlate maps for each disorder using both approaches. The novel approach, which accounted for co-occurring disorders, produced GMV correlates that were more focal and disorder specific (less correlated across disorders and fewer transdiagnostic abnormalities). CONCLUSIONS: This work offers the most comprehensive atlas of GMV correlates across major mental disorders. Modeling co-occurring disorders yielded more specific correlates, supporting this approach's validity.

Efficacy of opioid antagonist in patients with binge eating behavior: A systemic review and meta-analysis.,Fang YY; Yeh YC; Liu TL; Tien-Wei H; Ko CH,"BACKGROUND: Binge eating (BE) involves consuming unusually large amounts of food within a short period and feeling a loss of control. Neurobiological mechanisms underlying BE involve dysregulation of reward and inhibitory control systems, with the endogenous opioid system playing a key role. Opioid antagonists and the combination therapies with bupropion may have potential to reduce BE by affecting the reward system, but evidence regarding their effectiveness remains inconclusive. This meta-analysis reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) exploring the effects of opioid antagonists on BE frequency, BE severity, body weight, and mood. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, Web of Science, and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify RCTs published before May 14, 2023,. The primary outcomes were BE severity and frequency. The secondary outcomes were percentage change in body weight and depressive symptoms. RESULTS: Eight RCTs were included in our analysis. Opioid antagonists significantly reduced BE frequency (standard difference in means [SMD] = -0.624, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = -1.181 to -0.067, p = 0.028) and changes in body weight percentage (SMD = -0.981, 95 % CI = -1.657 to -0.305, p = 0.004), with a moderate-to-large effect size. Conversely, opioid antagonists didn't significantly improve BE severity (Hedges' g = -0.210, 95 % CI = -0.431 to 0.011, p = 0.063) or depressive symptoms (Hedges' g = -0.190, 95 % CI = -0.434 to 0.053, p = 0.125). Meta-regression analysis revealed that the dosage of naltrexone served as a moderator in reducing BE frequency and body weight percentage.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Randomized clinical trials and pilot randomized clinical trials were considered. RESULTS: Twelve studies were included. No studies evaluated athletes. No studies examined regular physical activity as the targeted intervention. Quality of life could not be meta-analyzed. Overall, meta-analyses showed that exercise or mind-body exercise was not more effective than controls in reducing depression symptoms, harmful exercise habits, eating behaviors, or emotional regulation skills. However, important methodological and clinical issues were detected in the included studies. This affected the certainty of evidence of the meta-analyzed outcomes which ranged from low to very low.

A comparative meta-analysis of the prevalence of exercise addiction in adults with and without indicated eating disorders.,Trott M; Jackson SE; Firth J; Jacob L; Grabovac I; Mistry A; Stubbs B; Smith L,"BACKGROUND: Exercise addiction is associated with multiple adverse outcomes and can be classified as co-occurring with an eating disorder, or a primary condition with no indication of eating disorders. We conducted a meta-analysis exploring the prevalence of exercise addiction in adults with and without indicated eating disorders. METHODS: A systematic review of major databases and grey literature was undertaken from inception to 30/04/2019. Studies reporting prevalence of exercise addiction with and without indicated eating disorders in adults were identified. A random effect meta-analysis was undertaken, calculating odds ratios for exercise addiction with versus without indicated eating disorders. RESULTS: Nine studies with a total sample of 2140 participants (mean age = 25.06; 70.6% female) were included. Within these, 1732 participants did not show indicated eating disorders (mean age = 26.4; 63.0% female) and 408 had indicated eating disorders (mean age = 23.46; 79.2% female). The odds ratio for exercise addiction in populations with versus without indicated eating disorders was 3.71 (95% CI 2.00-6.89; I(2) = 81; p  ≤ 0.001). Exercise addiction prevalence in both populations differed according to the measurement instrument used.

A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed following the PRISMA guidelines. Searches were conducted on PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, SciELO, ScienceDirect and ProQuest databases. Meta-analysis was performed using random effects models and meta-regression. Forty-three studies were included. There was a paucity of information regarding BEE in individuals with anorexia nervosa. The pooled caloric intake of participants with bulimia nervosa (BN) during BEE in laboratory studies was significantly greater in comparison to the caloric intake during BEE in clinical studies [(3070 (95%CI 2596, 3544) vs. 1789 (95%CI 1498, 2081)], respectively. In participants with binge eating disorder (BED), the pooled means were 2088 (95%CI 1819, 2358) kcal in laboratory studies and 1903 (95%CI 1622, 2184) kcal in clinical studies, with no statistically significant difference between groups. Overall, BEE had a mean duration of 37.3 min in participants with BN and 41.7 min in those with BED. We found a positive correlation between the average caloric intake and level of depression (β = 55.5; p = 0.019). BEE in individuals with BN or BED were characterized by the consumption of extremely large quantities of calories. This was mainly found in laboratory studies of individuals with BN.

Psychiatric Comorbidities in Persons With Epilepsy Compared With Persons Without Epilepsy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,Kwon CS; Rafati A; Ottman R; Christensen J; Kanner AM; Jetté N; Newton CR,"IMPORTANCE: Several psychiatric disorders have been found to occur more frequently in persons with epilepsy (PWE) than in persons without epilepsy. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the prevalence of 20 psychiatric disorders in PWE compared with persons without epilepsy. DATA SOURCES: The search included records from inception to February 2024 in Ovid, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO. STUDY SELECTION: Published epidemiological studies examining the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among PWE compared with persons without epilepsy were systematically reviewed. There were no restrictions on language or publication date. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Abstracts were reviewed in duplicate, and data were extracted using a standardized electronic form. Descriptive statistics and meta-analyses are presented. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Data were recorded on the prevalence of 20 psychiatric disorders among PWE compared with persons without epilepsy. Meta-analyses were performed along with descriptive analyses. RESULTS: The systematic search identified 10 392 studies, 27 of which met eligibility criteria. The meta-analyses included 565 443 PWE and 13 434 208 persons without epilepsy. The odds of most psychiatric disorders studied were significantly increased in PWE compared with those without epilepsy, including anxiety (odds ratio [OR], 2.11; 95% CI, 1.73-2.58); depression (OR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.94-3.09); bipolar disorder (OR, 3.12; 95% CI, 2.23-4.36); suicidal ideation (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.75-2.88) but not suicide attempt (OR, 3.17; 95% CI, 0.49-20.46); psychotic disorder (OR, 3.98; 95% CI, 2.57-6.15); schizophrenia (OR, 3.72; 95% CI, 2.44-5.67); obsessive-compulsive disorder (OR, 2.71; 95% CI, 1.76-4.15); posttraumatic stress disorder (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.14-2.73); eating disorders (OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.73-2.01); alcohol misuse (OR, 3.64; 95% CI, 2.27-5.83) and alcohol dependence (OR, 4.94; 95% CI, 3.50-6.96) but not alcohol abuse (OR, 2.10; 95% CI, 0.60-7.37); substance use disorder (OR, 2.75; 95% CI, 1.61-4.72); autism spectrum disorder (OR, 10.67; 95% CI, 6.35-17.91); and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (OR, 3.93; 95% CI, 3.80-4.08). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this comprehensive study, most psychiatric comorbidities examined were significantly more prevalent in PWE than in those without epilepsy.

METHODS: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to July 4, 2023, for RCTs that enrolled adults (aged ≥ 18 yr) presenting with any clinical condition and that randomized participants to either therapist-guided remote CBT (e.g., teleconference, videoconference) or in-person CBT. Paired reviewers assessed risk of bias and extracted data independently and in duplicate. We performed random-effects model meta-analyses to pool patient-important primary outcomes across eligible RCTs as standardized mean differences (SMDs). We used Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) guidance to assess the certainty of evidence and used the Instrument to Assess the Credibility of Effect Modification Analyses (ICEMAN) to rate the credibility of subgroup effects. RESULTS: We included 54 RCTs that enrolled a total of 5463 patients. Seventeen studies focused on treatment of anxiety and related disorders, 14 on depressive symptoms, 7 on insomnia, 6 on chronic pain or fatigue syndromes, 5 on body image or eating disorders, 3 on tinnitus, 1 on alcohol use disorder, and 1 on mood and anxiety disorders. Moderate-certainty evidence showed little to no difference in the effectiveness of therapist-guided remote and in-person CBT on primary outcomes (SMD -0.02, 95% confidence interval -0.12 to 0.07). INTERPRETATION: Moderate-certainty evidence showed little to no difference in the effectiveness of in-person and therapist-guided remote CBT across a range of mental health and somatic disorders, suggesting potential for the use of therapist-guided remote CBT to facilitate greater access to evidence-based care.

Reward contamination in restrictive anorexia nervosa: A meta-analysis of functional MRI studies.,Rye CS; Amorim FE; Ward LHE; Milton AL,"Individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN) are typically anhedonic, leading to the suggestion that intrinsic disturbances of reward processing may represent a trait marker of the disorder. Previous studies have used task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate reward-related brain activity in AN and reported altered activation in the prefrontal cortex, dorsal posterior cingulate cortex, and rostral anterior cingulate cortex. However, likely due to the varied paradigms and methodologies used, as well as the heterogeneity in sample characteristics, results have proved inconsistent. To determine whether AN patients with the restrictive subtype (AN-r) show different reward-induced activation patterns to matched healthy controls (HCs) at different illness stages, we conducted a meta-analysis of 19 task-based fMRI studies of reward-processing. Using the seed-based differential mapping (SDM) technique, we found differences in reward-related brain activity between AN-r and HCs. Moreover, different brain regions showed differential activation across illness stages, with the direction and magnitude of effects dependent on specific task stimuli. These findings suggest that those with AN-r show distorted reward processing as a consequence of reward contamination and alterations in valence assignment to reward stimuli. In weight-recovered AN-r patients, differences to HCs persisted but were limited to regions known to exhibit significant atrophy in AN-r, indicating that altered reward processing is associated with anorectic undernutrition. These findings have implications for developing pharmacological treatments to aid psychological recovery in AN-r.",2025,Jul,Pharmacol Biochem Behav,252,,174031,,10.1016/j.pbb.2025.174031,40348135,#199,Rye 2025,,,
Early response to psychological treatment for eating disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Chang PGRY; Delgadillo J; Waller G,"Early response is a well-established predictor of positive outcomes at the end of psychological treatments for common mental disorders. There is some prior evidence that this conclusion also applies to eating disorders, including three meta-analyses, but no moderators of that relationship have been identified. However, a number of further papers have been published since, which might influence the size of the effect of early response or the potential role of moderating factors. This pre-registered systematic review presents a comprehensive examination of this literature. Three databases were searched (Scopus, PsycInfo, PubMed). In total, 33 eligible studies were included in a narrative synthesis, and 25 studies were included in random-effects meta-analysis. The majority (91%) of studies were rated as having low or moderate risk of bias. Approximately half of patients across clinical samples showed early response to psychological therapy, which was most often defined as reliable symptomatic improvement during the first four sessions. A significant and moderate association was found between early response and post-treatment outcomes (r = 0.41 [95% CI: 0.32-0.481], p < .0001). Significant evidence of heterogeneity (Q[28] = 136.42, p < .0001; I(2) = 80.2%) was evident. The review was limited by the exclusion of grey literature and only 76% of studies provided sufficient statistical information for meta-analytic synthesis, although we found no significant evidence of publication bias, χ(2)(1) = 0.001, p = .97. Overall, evidence accumulated over twenty years establishes early response as the most robust predictor of treatment outcomes in the field of eating disorders. However, only half of patients show early change in this way. Further research is needed to determine whether there are patient or clinician characteristics that predict early response to psychological treatment for eating disorders.",2021,Jun,Clin Psychol Rev,86,,102032,,10.1016/j.cpr.2021.102032,33915335,#200,ChangPGRY 2021,,Psychological treatment,
Is cognitive behavioral therapy more effective than pharmacotherapy for binge spectrum disorders? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Samara MT; Michou N; Lappas AS; Argyrou A; Mathioudaki E; Bakaloudi DR; Tsekitsidi E; Polyzopoulou ZA; Christodoulou N; Papazisis G; Chourdakis M,"OBJECTIVES: Binge spectrum disorders are prevalent worldwide. Psychiatric and medical comorbidities are common, and societal costs are significant. Evidence-based treatment remains underutilized. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the recommended first-line treatment, but pharmacotherapy may be easier to access. INTERVENTIONS: Meta-analytic evidence directly comparing cognitive behavioral therapy with pharmacotherapy is lacking. We aimed to compare the effects of cognitive behavioral therapy interventions with any pharmacological treatment for binge spectrum disorders. We searched PubMed, Embase, CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov and reference lists for randomized controlled trials comparing cognitive behavioral therapy with any pharmacotherapy for bulimia nervosa/binge eating disorder and performed pairwise meta-analytic evaluations. PRIMARY OUTCOMES: Primary outcomes are remission and frequency of binges. Secondary outcomes are frequency of purges, response, eating disorder psychopathology, weight/body mass index, depression, anxiety, quality of life and dropouts. RESULTS: Eleven randomized controlled trials comparing cognitive behavioral therapy with fluoxetine/imipramine/desipramine/methylphenidate/sibutramine were identified (N = 531). Cognitive behavioral therapy was superior to antidepressants in terms of remission, frequency of binges and eating disorder psychopathology. There were no statistically significant differences for any of the individual cognitive behavioral therapy vs drug comparisons in terms of response/depression/anxiety/weight/quality of life/dropouts. Cognitive behavioral therapy was not superior to sibutramine/methylphenidate for the primary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Data are scarce, comparisons underpowered and, considering the inherent methodological limitations of psychotherapy trials, questions arise regarding the presumed superiority of cognitive behavioral therapy.

"Affective cognition in eating disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis of the performance on the ""Reading the Mind in the Eyes"" Test.",Preti A; Siddi S; Marzola E; Abbate Daga G,"BACKGROUND: The Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) is listed in the National Institute of Mental Health's Research Domain Criteria as a tool apt to measure the understanding of others' mental states. People diagnosed with anorexia nervosa (AN) showed poorer performances on the RMET than healthy controls. Less data are available concerning other eating disorders. METHODS: Systematic review of four major databases from inception to July 15, 2021 following the PRISMA guidelines. Meta-analysis of cross-sectional observational studies comparing the scores of the RMET between patients with eating disorders and age- and-gender matched control groups. RESULTS: Out of 21 studies, we retrieved 29 independent samples of patients diagnosed with an eating disorder. Patients with active AN (n = 580) showed worse performances on the RMET than controls (n = 1019). Year of publication accounted for 61% of the (substantial: I(2) = 81%) heterogeneity in the meta-analysis. Earlier studies were more likely to find worse performances on the RMET of patients with active AN than later studies. Patients with bulimia nervosa (n = 185) performed poorly as compared to controls (n = 249), but the results were not statistically significant on the random-effect model. Obese patients with binge-eating disorder (n = 54) did not differ on the RMET from obese controls (n = 52). Patients with eating disorder not otherwise specified (n = 57) showed minimal differences compared to controls (n = 96). Study quality was good in six studies only.

Sensory processing across eating disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis of self-report inventories.,Cobbaert L; Hay P; Mitchell PB; Roza SJ; Perkes I,"OBJECTIVE: This review investigated the extant literature regarding the relationship between eating disorder diagnoses and sensory processing as measured by validated and reliable self-report inventories. Increasing evidence highlights the role of sensory processing in cognitive functions. Sensory processing is implicated in mental-ill health, including eating disorders (ED) and body image disturbances. However, the pathophysiological underpinnings of sensory processing, encompassing exteroception and interoception, in relation to ED remain underexplored. METHOD: We included studies involving participants aged 15 years or older with an eating disorder diagnosis confirmed by semi-structured or structured interviews. We further limited inclusion to articles using validated and reliable self-report instruments to measure sensory processing. Our meta-analysis focused on studies using the interoceptive awareness subscale from the second version of the Eating Disorder Inventory. We used the Critical Appraisal checklist for quasi-experimental studies to assess the quality of included articles. RESULTS: There were 19 studies that met our inclusion criteria. Most studies showed moderate-to-high quality. Anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) were associated with heightened exteroception. Moreover, people with AN reported a heightened sense of taste compared to those with BN. Our meta-analysis comprising 10 studies, 19 samples, and 6382 participants revealed that AN (binge-purge subtype) and BN were associated with increased interoceptive difficulties compared to AN (restrictive subtype) or binge-eating disorder. DISCUSSION: Overall, this review emphasizes the need for a deeper investigation into sensory processing, spanning both exteroception and interoception, in relation to ED. This may prove important for individualizing person-centered care. PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE: How people process internal, for example, hunger, and external, for example, taste and sensations is known to influence cognition and mental-ill health, including ED and body image disturbances. However, the ways in which sensory processing may contribute to ED are incompletely understood. We found that individuals with AN or BN experienced heightened exteroception, while people with an eating disorder characterized by purging reported increased interoceptive difficulties. These patterns could inform the development of more personalized treatments.",2024,Jul,Int J Eat Disord,57,7,1465-1488,,10.1002/eat.24184,38511825,#207,Cobbaert 2024,,Anorexia; Binge-eating disorder; Bulimia; Symptom correlates of ED,
Efficacy and safety of deep brain stimulation for treatment-refractory anorexia nervosa: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Karaszewska D; Cleintuar P; Oudijn M; Lok A; van Elburg A; Denys D; Mocking R,"BACKGROUND: Several pioneering studies investigated deep brain stimulation (DBS) in treatment-refractory anorexia nervosa (AN) patients, but overall effects remain yet unclear. Aim of this study was to obtain estimates of efficacy of DBS in AN-patients using meta-analysis. METHODS: We searched three electronic databases until 1st of November 2021, using terms related to DBS and AN. We included trials that investigated the clinical effects of DBS in AN-patients. We obtained data including psychiatric comorbidities, medication use, DBS target, and study duration. Primary outcome was Body Mass Index (BMI), secondary outcome was quality of life, and the severity of psychiatric symptoms, including eating disorder, obsessive-compulsive, depressive, and anxiety symptoms. We assessed the risk of bias using the ROBINS-I tool. RESULTS: Four studies were included for meta-analysis, with a total of 56 patients with treatment-refractory AN. Follow-up ranged from 6-24 months. Random effects meta-analysis showed a significant increase in BMI following DBS, with a large effect size (Hedges's g = 1 ∙ 13; 95% CI = 0 ∙ 80 to 1 ∙ 46; Z-value = 6 ∙ 75; P < 0 ∙ 001), without heterogeneity (I(2 )= 0 ∙ 00, P = 0 ∙ 901). Random effects meta-analysis also showed a significant increase in quality of life (Hedges's g = 0 ∙ 86; 95% CI = 0 ∙ 44 to 1 ∙ 28; Z-value = 4 ∙ 01, P < 0 ∙ 001). Furthermore, DBS decreased the severity of psychiatric symptoms (Hedges's g = 0 ∙ 89; 95% CI = 0 ∙ 57 to 1 ∙ 21; Z-value = 5 ∙ 47; P < 0 ∙ 001, I(2 )= 4 ∙ 29, P = 0 ∙ 371). DISCUSSION: In this first meta-analysis, DBS showed statistically large beneficial effects on weight restoration, quality of life, and reduction of psychiatric symptoms in patients with treatment-refractory AN.

Estimating the Effect of Motivational Interventions in Patients with Eating Disorders: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,Fetahi E; Søgaard AS; Sjögren M,"Motivation to change behavior is seen as an important factor in achieving a better treatment effect in patients with eating disorders (ED). The aim of this systematic review was to assess whether motivational interviewing (MI) and motivational enhancement therapy (MET) might (1) increase motivation to change behavior and (2) improve eating disorder psychopathology (EDP) and body mass index (BMI) in patients with ED. To investigate this, a literature search was conducted on 9 March 2021 on four scientific databases: Cochrane, Embase (Ovid), MEDLINE (PubMed), and PsycInfo (EBSCO). A total of 2647 publications were identified and following a rigorous stepwise procedure to assess titles and abstracts and, thereafter, full texts of relevant publications, 13 studies were included in the data extraction and analyses. A few individual studies (n = 5) found a significant increase in motivation, two a decrease in ED symptoms (n = 2), while none found an effect on BMI. However, the meta-analysis of each outcome found effect sizes near zero, thereby confirming the results of previous narrative reviews that have described a lack of effect of MET/MI on motivation in ED. Since the individual studies differ substantially in design, and the outcomes were inconsistently assessed with regards to instruments and duration, the effect of MET/MI on motivation for behavioral change, ED psychopathology, and BMI is still unclear.",2022,Apr,J Pers Med,12,4,,,10.3390/jpm12040577,35455693,#212,Fetahi 2022,,Treatment,
A systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence and odds of eating disorders in patients with celiac disease and vice-versa.,Nikniaz Z; Beheshti S; Abbasalizad Farhangi M; Nikniaz L,"OBJECTIVES: In the present systematic review and meta-analysis study, we aimed to review studies that assessed the prevalence and risk of eating disorders (EDs) in patients with celiac disease (CD) and vice-versa. METHOD: We conducted a systematic search in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science for studies that assessed the prevalence and risk of AN in patients with CD and vice-versa. Joanna Briggs Institute tools were used for critical appraisal. The STATA software was used for the meta-analysis of the random-effect model. RESULTS: In this study, 23 observational studies were included. The results of the meta-analysis indicated that the pooled prevalence of EDs and bulimia nervosa in patients with CD was 8.88% [95% CI: 6.4, 11.7] and 7.26% [95% CI: 0.23, 21.57], respectively. Moreover, the risk of anorexia nervosa in patients with CD was significantly higher than in the healthy population (relative risk [RR]: 1.48 [95% CI: 1.32, 1.64]). The rates of CD in patients with AN and EDs were 0.96% [95% CI: 0.15, 2.31] and 0.90% [95% CI: 0.56, 1.31], respectively. Moreover, the overall risk of CD in patients with AN was significantly higher compared with healthy adults (RR: 2.35 [95% CI: 1.27-3.44]). DISCUSSION: The result of the present meta-analysis showed the high prevalence of EDs in patients with CD.

Screening for Eating Disorders in Adolescents and Adults: Evidence Report and Systematic Review for the US Preventive Services Task Force.,Feltner C; Peat C; Reddy S; Riley S; Berkman N; Middleton JC; Balio C; Coker-Schwimmer M; Jonas DE,"IMPORTANCE: Eating disorders are associated with adverse health and social outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To review the evidence on screening for eating disorders in adolescents and adults to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, and trial registries through December 19, 2020; surveillance through January 1, 2022. STUDY SELECTION: English-language studies of screening test accuracy, randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of screening or interventions for eating disorders in populations with screen-detected or previously untreated eating disorders (trials limited to populations who are underweight were ineligible). DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Dual review of abstracts, full-text articles, and study quality. Meta-analysis of test accuracy studies and intervention trials. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Test accuracy, eating disorder symptom severity, quality of life, depression, and harms. RESULTS: Fifty-seven studies were included (N = 10 773); 3 (n = 1073) limited to adolescents (mean or median age, 14-15 years). No study directly evaluated the benefits and harms of screening. Seventeen studies (n = 6804) evaluated screening test accuracy. The SCOFF questionnaire (cut point ≥2) had a pooled sensitivity of 84% (95% CI, 74% to 90%) and pooled specificity of 80% (95% CI, 65% to 89%) in adults (10 studies, n = 3684). Forty RCTs (n = 3969) evaluated interventions for eating disorders; none enrolled a screen-detected population. Lisdexamfetamine for binge eating disorder (4 RCTs; n = 900) was associated with larger reductions in eating disorder symptom severity on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for binge eating (YBOCS-BE) than placebo (pooled mean difference, -5.75 [95% CI, -8.32 to -3.17]). Two RCTs (n = 465) of topiramate for binge eating disorder found larger reductions in YBOCS-BE scores associated with topiramate than placebo, from -6.40 (95% CI, -8.16 to -4.64) to -2.55 (95% CI, -4.22 to -0.88). Nine pharmacotherapy trials (n = 2006) reported on harms. Compared with placebo, lisdexamfetamine was associated with higher rates of dry mouth, headache, and insomnia, and topiramate was associated with higher rates of paresthesia, taste perversion, confusion, and concentration difficulty. Twenty-four trials (n = 1644) assessed psychological interventions. Guided self-help for binge eating disorder improved eating disorder symptom severity more than control (pooled standardized mean difference, -0.96 [95% CI, -1.26 to -0.67]) (5 studies, n = 391). Evidence on other interventions was limited. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: No studies directly assessed the benefits and harms of screening. The SCOFF questionnaire had adequate accuracy for detecting eating disorders among adults. No treatment trials enrolled screen-detected populations; guided self-help, lisdexamfetamine, and topiramate were effective for reducing eating disorder symptom severity among referred populations with binge eating disorder, but pharmacotherapies were also associated with harms.",2022,Mar,JAMA,327,11,1068-1082,,10.1001/jama.2022.1807,35289875,#216,Feltner 2022,,Pharmacotherapy; Prevention; Psychological treatment; Screening,
Myocardial mechanics in anorexia nervosa: a systematic review and meta-analysis of speckle tracking echocardiographic studies.,Gherbesi E; Faggiano A; Sala C; Carugo S; Grassi G; Cuspidi C; Tadic M,"BACKGROUND: Clinical complications of anorexia nervosa (AN) include cardiac structural and functional alterations. Available evidence on impaired myocardial deformation in AN patients without overt systolic dysfunction as assessed by left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is scanty and based on a few studies. The aim of the present meta-analysis was to provide comprehensive and updated information on this issue. METHODS: Following the PRISMA guidelines, systematic searches were conducted across bibliographic databases (Pub-Med, OVID, EMBASE and Cochrane library) to identify eligible studies from inception up to 31 January 2024. Searches were limited to clinical investigations published in English reporting data on left ventricular (LV) mechanics (i.e. global longitudinal strain) in patients with anorexia and controls. The statistical difference of the echocardiographic variables of interest between groups such as LVEF and global longitudinal strain (GLS) was calculated by standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) by using random-effects models. RESULTS: Five studies including 171 AN and 147 healthy normal-weight individuals were considered for the analysis. Pooled average LVEF values were 63.2 ± 0.4% in the healthy control group and 64.6 ± 1.0% in the AN group (SMD -0.08 ± 0.11, CI: -0.15/0.30, P  = 0.51); the corresponding values of GLS were -20.1 ± 0.9% and -20.2 ± 0.9% (SMD 0.07 ± 0.3, CI: -0.46/0.60, P  = 0.80). Unlike GLS, apical strain (data from three studies) was higher in AN than in controls (-23.1 ± 1.8 vs. -21.3 ± 1.8; SMD: -0.42 ± 0.17, CI: -0.08/-0.76, P  = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present meta-analysis do not support the view that myocardial deformation as assessed by GLS is impaired in patients with AN and preserved LVEF. The role of STE in detecting subclinical cardiac damage in this clinical condition deserves to be evaluated in future studies including regional LV strain.",2024,Oct,J Cardiovasc Med (Hagerstown),25,10,740-748,,10.2459/JCM.0000000000001661,39166392,#217,Gherbesi 2024,,Anorexia; Medical complications,
Central coherence and set-shifting between nonunderweight eating disorders and anorexia nervosa: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Keegan E; Tchanturia K; Wade TD,"OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis compared previously documented inefficiencies in central coherence and set-shifting between people with nonunderweight eating disorders (bulimia nervosa and binge-eating disorder) and people with anorexia nervosa. METHOD: We performed random-effects meta-analyses on 16 studies (1,112 participants) for central coherence and 38 studies (3,505 participants) for set-shifting. Random effects meta-regressions were used to test whether the effect sizes for people with nonunderweight eating disorders were significantly different from the effect sizes for people with anorexia nervosa. RESULTS: People with anorexia nervosa (Hedge's g = -0.53, 95% CIs: -0.80, -0.27, p < .001) and bulimia nervosa (Hedge's g = -0.70, 95% CIs: -1.14, -0.25, p = .002), but not binge-eating disorder, had significantly poorer central coherence than healthy controls. Similarly, people with anorexia nervosa (Hedge's g = -0.38, 95% CIs: -0.50, -0.26, p < .001) and bulimia nervosa (Hedge's g = -0.55, 95% CIs: -0.81, -0.29, p < .001), but not binge-eating disorder, had significantly poorer set-shifting than healthy controls. The effect sizes for people with nonunderweight eating disorders did not significantly differ from those for people with anorexia nervosa. DISCUSSION: Our meta-analysis was underpowered to make definitive judgments about people with binge-eating disorder. However, we found that people with bulimia nervosa clearly have central coherence and set-shifting inefficiencies which do not significantly differ from those observed in people with anorexia nervosa. Clinically, this suggests that people with bulimia nervosa might benefit from adjunctive approaches to address these inefficiencies, such as cognitive remediation therapy.",2021,Mar,Int J Eat Disord,54,3,229-243,,10.1002/eat.23430,33305366,#218,Keegan 2021,,Anorexia; Neurocognition,
Is poor global processing a transdiagnostic feature of Body Dysmorphic Disorder and Anorexia Nervosa? A meta-analysis.,Lang K; Kerr-Gaffney J; Hodsoll J; Jassi A; Tchanturia K; Krebs G,"Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) and anorexia nervosa (AN) are characterised by body image disturbance. It has been suggested that poor global integration in visual processing may underlie distorted body image, but empirical studies have yielded mixed results. The current study involved two meta-analyses aimed at examining the extent to which poor global processing is evident in BDD and AN. Studies were identified through a systematic literature search up to October 2020. The BDD search yielded 16 studies and the AN search yielded 18 studies. Random-effect models demonstrated a small pooled effect size for BDD (g = -0.44, 95 % CI -0.70, -0.17, p < 0.001) and a moderate pooled effect size for AN (g = -0.63, 95 % CI -0.77, -0.49, p <  .001), with no evidence of significant publication bias for either. The results provide evidence that poor global processing is a transdiagnostic feature of both BDD and AN, although effects may be more pronounced in AN.

Prevalence of alcohol use disorder among individuals who binge eat: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Bogusz K; Kopera M; Jakubczyk A; Trucco EM; Kucharska K; Walenda A; Wojnar M,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Binge eating disorder (BED) is correlated with substance use. This study aimed to estimate the life-time prevalence of alcohol use disorder (AUD) among individuals with non-compensatory binge eating and determine whether their life-time prevalence of AUD is higher than in non-bingeing controls. DESIGN: A systematic search of databases (PubMed, Embase and Web of Science) for studies of adults diagnosed with BED or a related behavior that also reported the life-time prevalence of AUD was conducted. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol was followed. The protocol was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO). SETTING: Studies originating in Canada, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen studies meeting the inclusion criteria were found, representing 69 233 individuals. MEASUREMENTS: Life-time prevalence of AUD among individuals with binge eating disorder and their life-time relative risk of AUD compared with individuals without this disorder. RESULTS: The pooled life-time prevalence of AUD in individuals with binge eating disorder was 19.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 13.7-27.9]. The risk of life-time AUD incidence among individuals with binge eating disorder was more than 1.5 times higher than controls (relative risk = 1.59, 95% CI = 1.41-1.79).

A meta-analytic review of trials that tested whether eating disorder prevention programs prevent eating disorder onset.,Stice E; Onipede ZA; Marti CN,"This report provides a review of randomized controlled trials that tested whether an eating disorder prevention program significantly reduced future onset of eating disorders, which is important because eating disorders are common and result in marked functional impairment. We identified 15 trials involving 5080 participants (mean ages ranging from 14.5 to 22.3) that reported 19 tests of whether selective eating disorder prevention programs significantly reduced future onset of eating disorders relative to some type of minimal control condition or a credible alternative intervention. Healthy lifestyle modification prevention programs, dissonance-based prevention programs, and a self-esteem/self-efficacy prevention program significantly reduced future onset of eating disorders, though the later was only evaluated in one trial. Psychoeducational, cognitive behavioral, behavioral weight gain, interpersonal, and family-therapy-based prevention programs did not significantly reduce future onset of eating disorders. The average prevention effect size was statistically significant (OR = 1.64, 95% CI = [1.09, 2.46], t = 2.54, p = .020) and there was heterogeneity in effect sizes (Q [18] = 35.96, p = .007). Prevention effects were significantly larger for trials that recruited participants with elevations on a single risk factor versus with elevations in multiple risk factors and for healthy lifestyle modification prevention programs versus cognitive behavioral prevention programs, though the remaining examined factors did not moderate intervention effect sizes (e.g., risk of bias). The fact that lifestyle modification and dissonance-based prevention programs significantly reduced future onset of eating disorders in multiple trials, producing a 54% to 77% reduction in future eating disorder onset implies that broadly implementing these prevention programs could reduce the population prevalence of eating disorders.",2021,Jul,Clin Psychol Rev,87,,102046,,10.1016/j.cpr.2021.102046,34048952,#225,Stice 2021,,Prevention,
Fertility and Reproduction after Recovery from Anorexia Nervosa: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Long-Term Follow-Up Studies.,Chaer R; Nakouzi N; Itani L; Tannir H; Kreidieh D; El Masri D; El Ghoch M,"Reproductive health is compromised during anorexia nervosa (AN). However, it is still unclear whether this medical complication is reversible after recovery from AN. The purpose of this paper was to conduct a systematic review of the major reproductive health outcomes in females after recovery from AN. The review was conducted in adherence to preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Data were collated using meta-analysis and a narrative approach. Of the 1186 articles retrieved, five studies met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. These studies monitored weight-restored females who had recovered from AN for a follow-up period of between six and 18 years. Their narrative analysis revealed that appropriate treatment of AN leads to the normalization of reproductive function, especially in terms of fertility, pregnancy, and childbirth rates. The meta-analysis confirmed this finding, where the pooled odds of childbirth rates between the AN group and the general population was not statistically significant (OR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.43-1.29, p = 0.41). We conclude that if patients undergo appropriate eating-disorder treatment and weight restoration, it appears to be unlikely that reproductive health is affected by AN. However, since this finding is derived from only a few studies, it requires replication and confirmation.",2020,Dec,Diseases,8,4,,,10.3390/diseases8040046,33339411,#228,Chaer 2020,,Anorexia; Longer term outcomes; Medical complications; Reproductive health,
Olfaction is a Marker of Severity but Not Diagnosis in Anorexia Nervosa: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,Mai Y; Zhang X; Li Z; Wu X; Zeng B; Fang Y; Zou L; Zhao J; Hummel T,"Researchers have examined if olfaction is a sensitive biomarker of anorexia nervosa, but considerable heterogeneity across studies makes it difficult to reach a consensus. This review and meta-analysis sought to clarify if olfaction is altered in individuals with anorexia nervosa and explore potential moderators of olfaction in this population. We performed quantitative and qualitative analyses of olfactory function in individuals with anorexia nervosa compared with healthy controls. A random effect model was used to estimate pooled effect sizes, and meta-regression was conducted to identify potential moderators. We found that individuals with anorexia nervosa had largely intact olfactory function compared with healthy controls in terms of threshold (g = -0.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] (-0.65,0.47), p = 0.757), identification (g = -0.06, 95% CI (-0.32,0.20), p = 0.642), and overall olfactory function (g = -0.47, 95% CI (-1.02,0.07), p = 0.090). Discrimination was different from control (g = -0.51, 95% CI (-0.97,-0.05), p = 0.029). However, after sensitivity analysis, the pooled effect size was nonsignificant in discrimination. Olfactory sensitivity covaried with anorexia nervosa severity, body mass index (BMI) positively moderated olfactory threshold score (β = 0.79, 95% CI (0.18,1.41), p = 0.020) in individuals with anorexia nervosa. Disease duration negatively moderated olfactory threshold score (β = -0.21, 95% CI (-0.40,-0.03), p = 0.034).

Lisdexamfetamine and binge-eating disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the preclinical and clinical data with a focus on mechanism of drug action in treating the disorder.,Schneider E; Higgs S; Dourish CT,"Binge-Eating Disorder (BED) is the most common eating disorder in the United States. Lisdexamfetamine (LDX) was approved in 2015 by the FDA for treatment of BED and is the only drug approved for treating the disorder. There has been no systematic evaluation of the published clinical and preclinical evidence for efficacy of LDX in treating BED and the mechanisms responsible for the therapeutic action of the drug. To address this gap, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis using PRISMA guidelines. Fourteen clinical and seven preclinical articles were included. There is consistent evidence from clinical studies that LDX is an effective treatment for BED and that the drug reduces the BED symptoms and body weight of patients with the disorder. There is also consistent evidence from preclinical studies that LDX reduces food intake but no consistent evidence for a preferential reduction of palatable food consumption by the drug in rodents. The evidence on mechanism of action is more limited and suggests LDX may reduce binge eating by a combination of effects on appetite/satiety, reward, and cognitive processes, including attention and impulsivity/inhibition, that are mediated by catecholamine and serotonin mechanisms in the brain. There is an urgent need for adequately powered, placebo-controlled, behavioural and neuroimaging studies with LDX (recruiting patients and/or individuals with subclinical BED symptoms) to further investigate the mechanism of action of the drug in treating BED. An improved understanding of the behavioural and neurochemical mechanisms of action of LDX could lead to the development of improved drug therapies to treat BED.",2021,Dec,Eur Neuropsychopharmacol,53,,49-78,,10.1016/j.euroneuro.2021.08.001,34461386,#230,Schneider 2021,"Sarita Maharajh (2025-07-31 01:37:42)(Select): Results are grouped into RCTs, non-RCTs, and preclinical studies.

Dialectical Behaviour Therapy Improves Emotion Dysregulation Mainly in Binge Eating Disorder and Bulimia Nervosa: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,Rozakou-Soumalia N; Dârvariu Ş; Sjögren JM,"Emotion dysregulation is a transdiagnostic phenomenon in Eating Disorders (ED), and Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) (which was developed for reducing dysregulated emotions in personality disorders) has been employed in patients with ED. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated whether the effect of DBT was stronger on emotion dysregulation, general psychopathology, and Body Mass Index (BMI) in participants with ED, when compared to a control group (active therapy and waitlist). Eleven studies were identified in a systematic search in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Most studies included participants with Binge Eating Disorder (BED) (n = 8), some with Bulimia Nervosa (BN) (n = 3), and only one with Anorexia Nervosa (AN). The pooled effect of DBT indicated a greater improvement in Emotion Regulation (ER) (g = -0.69, p = 0.01), depressive symptoms (g = -0.33, p < 0.00001), ED psychopathology (MD = -0.90, p = 0.005), Objective Binge Episodes (OBE) (MD = -0.27, p = 0.003), and BMI (MD = -1.93, p = 0.01) compared to the control group.

Prevalence and related factors of eating disorders in pregnancy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Çiçekoğlu Öztürk P; Taştekin Ouyaba A,"PURPOSE: To reveal the prevalence of eating disorders (EDs) and related factors in pregnancy. METHODS: The search was performed in PubMed, EBSCOhost, Web of Science, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Ovid databases search up to April 3, 2022, using the keywords combination of ""(eating disorders OR anorexia nervosa OR bulimia nervosa OR binge eating disorder) AND (pregnancy OR pregnant)"". Two researchers independently extracted data from the articles using a standard form. We evaluated the quality of the studies according to the Joanna Briggs Institute assessment tools. RESULTS: The prevalence of EDs in pregnant women in the 11 studies involving 2,369,520 pregnant women was ranging between 0.5 and 10.6%. The prevalence of EDs in pregnant women was 4.3% (95% confidence interval 2%-9%; I(2) = 99.5%). The prevalence of anorexia nervosa and binge eating disorder during pregnancy shows a statistically significant increase compared to pre-pregnancy, and the prevalence of bulimia nervosa during pregnancy decreases. The prevalence of EDs is higher in pregnant women under 30 years of age, secondary school graduates, married, and with normal BMI. Half of the pregnant women with EDs had anxiety and about one-third of pregnant women had depression. Excessive exercise is observed in 0.7% of pregnant women, fasting in 0.3%, laxative or diuretic use in 0.1%, and self-induced vomiting in 0.6%. CONCLUSIONS: This study is important as it is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to reveal the global prevalence of EDs in pregnant women and related factors. Continuing routine screening tests to detect EDs during pregnancy may contribute to taking special preventive measures for risk groups and protecting mother-child health.

Differences in the use of emotion regulation strategies between anorexia and bulimia nervosa: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Puttevils L; Vanderhasselt MA; Horczak P; Vervaet M,"OBJECTIVE: Research has identified abnormal emotion regulation (ER) as an underlying mechanism in the onset and maintenance of eating disorders. Yet, it still remains unclear whether different forms of ER, adaptive and maladaptive strategies, are similar across categories of eating disorders. METHOD: A systematic review and meta-analysis were carried out to look at ER differences between anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN), two common eating disorder pathologies with different eating patterns. RESULTS: 41 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The results revealed no differences in the use of maladaptive ER strategies between individuals with AN and BN, however patients with AN tend to use less adaptive ER strategies as compared to patients with BN. CONCLUSIONS: Making less use of adaptive strategies in AN might be due to low body weight and high levels of alexithymia which define AN. In order to improve treatment outcome in individuals suffering from AN, these findings suggest to focus more on improving the use of adaptive ER strategies.",2021,Aug,Compr Psychiatry,109,,152262,,10.1016/j.comppsych.2021.152262,34265598,#245,Puttevils 2021,,Anorexia; Bulimia; ED phenomenology,

METHOD: Four electronic literature databases were searched to retrieve eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs). The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses was used to select eligible studies. Meta-analyses of extracted data were then conducted by RevMan 5.3 software. RESULTS: Six RCTs totalling 297 participants were included. Results showed significantly larger decreases in the frequency of binges in participants who underwent VR-enhanced CBT compared to CBT. However, there was no statistically significant difference in the change in body mass index or frequency of purges. Additionally, there were significantly larger decreases in situation-induced body dissatisfaction in participants who underwent VR-enhanced CBT compared to CBT, but no significant difference in improvement of overall body satisfaction. CONCLUSION: VR-enhanced CBT shows greater efficacy than CBT in reducing situation-induced body dissatisfaction and frequency of binges. Our results highlight the potential of VR in helping patients develop coping strategies to food/situational triggers.

Low intensity psychological interventions for the treatment of feeding and eating disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Davey E; Bennett SD; Bryant-Waugh R; Micali N; Takeda A; Alexandrou A; Shafran R,"BACKGROUND: Feeding and eating disorders are associated with significant illness burden and costs, yet access to evidence-based care is limited. Low intensity psychological interventions have the potential to increase such access. METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted on the use of low intensity psychological interventions for the treatment of feeding and eating disorders. Studies comparing low intensity psychological interventions against high intensity therapies and non-eating disorder specific psychological interventions were included, as well as those with waiting list control arms. There were three primary outcomes: eating disorder psychopathology, diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (DSM) severity specifier-related outcomes and rates of remission/recovery. RESULTS: Thirty-three studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising 3665 participants, and 30 studies were included in the meta-analysis. Compared to high intensity therapies, low intensity psychological interventions were equivalent on reducing eating disorder psychopathology (g = - 0.13), more effective at improving DSM severity specifier-related outcomes (g = - 0.15), but less likely to achieve remission/recovery (risk ratio (RR) = 0.70). Low intensity psychological interventions were superior to non-eating disorder specific psychological interventions and waiting list controls across all three primary outcomes. CONCLUSION: Overall, findings suggest that low intensity psychological interventions can successfully treat eating disorder symptoms. Few potential moderators had a statistically significant effect on outcome. The number of studies for many comparisons was low and the methodological quality of the studies was poor, therefore results should be interpreted with caution. More research is needed to establish the effectiveness of low intensity psychological interventions for children and young people, as well as for individuals with anorexia nervosa, avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, pica and rumination disorder.",2023,Apr,J Eat Disord,11,1,56,,10.1186/s40337-023-00775-2,37016447,#252,Davey 2023,,Psychological treatment,
Acute Augmentations to Psychological Therapies in Eating Disorders: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,Pennesi JL; Johnson C; Radünz M; Wade TD,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to examine the use and efficacy of acute augmentation therapies in eating disorders. RECENT FINDINGS: A meta-analysis addressing this topic across psychological disorders found augmentation significantly improved therapy outcome with strongest findings for augmentations targeting biological mechanisms; however, only one study examined eating disorders. Our systematic review identified 29 studies examining people with eating disorders (N = 1831 participants, 93.7% female), of which 17 RCTs (n = 1162 participants) were included in the meta-analysis. Small subgroups of acute augmentations were identified. Adding acute augmentations to an intervention was effective in 72.4% of studies, with a significant effect on eating disorder outcomes (Hedges' g = 0.14, 95% CI: [0.02, 0.26]).

The Prevalence of Impulse Control Disorders and Behavioral Addictions in Eating Disorders: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,Devoe DJ; Anderson A; Bahji A; Singh M; Patten SB; Soumbasis A; Ramirez Pineda A; Flanagan J; Richardson C; Lange T; Dimitropoulos G; Paslakis G,"Aim: Individuals with eating disorders (EDs) may present with impulse control disorders (ICDs) and behavioral addictions (BAs), which may result in additional suffering and treatment resistance. However, the prevalence of ICDs and BAs in EDs has not been systematically examined. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the prevalence of ICDs and BAs in ED samples. Methods: A comprehensive electronic database search of the peer-reviewed literature was conducted in the following online databases: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, and CINAHL from their inception to May 2021. We restricted review eligibility to research studies reporting prevalence for ICDs or BAs in individuals with diagnosed EDs. The outcome for this review was the prevalence of ICDs or BAs in individuals with EDs. A series of random-effects meta-analyses were performed on eligible studies to estimate the pooled proportions and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Thirty-five studies met the inclusion criteria, including a total of 9,646 individuals identified as having an ED, 18 of these studies specifically examined ICDs/BAs in AN, BN, and BED. Random-effects pooled estimates demonstrated that the comorbid prevalence of any ICD was 22%. The prevalence of comorbid pathological/compulsive buying was highest (19%), followed by kleptomania (18%), pathological internet use (12%), intermittent explosive disorder (4%), trichotillomania (3%), and gambling disorder (2%). In addition, the prevalence of stealing/shoplifting behaviors was 30% in those with EDs. Conclusion: This is the first meta-analysis on the comorbid prevalence of EDs and ICDs/BAs. We found a moderate prevalence for these comorbid conditions, with approximately one out of five individuals with an ED also displaying a comorbid ICD/BA. Although causal inferences cannot be drawn, the numbers strongly suggest that clinical screening/monitoring of ICDs/BAs should be part of the clinical routine in cohorts with EDs. ED settings need either the capacity to manage these disorders or adequate access to relevant services. Further investigations are needed to reveal common underlying pathomechanisms.

Dehydroepiandrosterone status and efficacy of dehydroepiandrosterone supplementation for bone health in anorexia nervosa: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Lin J; Kao TW; Cheng YC; Fan KC; Huang YC; Liu CW,"OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to determine the status of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in women with anorexia nervosa (AN) and to assess the efficacy of DHEA supplementation as a treatment for bone health in women with AN. METHOD: Studies were retrieved from the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, and Scopus databases from inception to February 14, 2022. Observational studies that compared serum DHEA levels between women with AN and healthy controls were included for meta-analysis, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that evaluated the effects of DHEA supplementation on bone mass were reviewed. RESULTS: Meta-analysis of 15 cross-sectional studies revealed that patients with AN had significantly elevated serum DHEA levels (mean difference (MD) = 311.63 ng/dl; 95% confidence interval (CI), 78.01-545.25) and reduced DHEAS levels (MD = -24.90 μg/dl; 95% CI, -41.72 to -8.07) compared with healthy controls. A systematic review of seven RCTs found that DHEA monotherapy does not improve bone mineral density (BMD) compared with placebo after adjusting for weight gain. While the combination of DHEA and conjugated oral contraceptives has led to increased bone strength and decreased bone loss, the beneficial effect appears to be limited to older adolescents and adults with closed physes. Potential detrimental effects on BMD were identified in younger adolescents with open physes in one study. DISCUSSION: Due to the lack of apparent benefit of DHEA in women with AN and its potential detrimental effect on BMD in young patients with AN, current evidence does not support the use of DHEA. PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates that women with anorexia nervosa have abnormal levels of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), which have been suggested by previous studies to play a role in the development of low bone density in this condition. However, current evidence does not support the use of DHEA as a treatment to preserve bone health in patients with anorexia nervosa given the lack of clear benefit following its use and also because of a potential detrimental effect on bone mineral density in young patients with anorexia nervosa.",2022,Jun,Int J Eat Disord,55,6,733-746,,10.1002/eat.23714,35460091,#257,Lin 2022,,Anorexia; Pharmacotherapy; medical aspects of ED,
"Prevalence of non-suicidal self-injury, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, suicide mortality in eating disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",Amiri S; Khan MA,"Eating disorders have a wide and profound impact on psychological and general health. The study aims to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date review of non-suicidal self-injury, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide mortality in a variety of eating disorders.

For each of the eligible studies, the prevalence of suicide-related issues in eating disorders was calculated. The prevalence of non-suicidal self-injury, suicide ideation, and suicide attempts was then calculated for each anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. The random-effects method was used for the pool of studies. Fifty-two articles were used for this study and included in the meta-analysis. The prevalence of non-suicidal self-injury is 40% with a confidence interval between 33-46% (I(2) 97.36%).

Recent studies highlight their effects on pathophysiological pathways, indicating their therapeutic promise, particularly for binge eating disorder (BED). This systematic review evaluates the therapeutic effects of GLP-1 agonists on BED, focusing on weight management and eating behaviors. METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library, along with manual searches, identified studies assessing GLP-1 agonists in BED patients up to November 8, 2024. Observational studies and clinical trials meeting inclusion criteria were analyzed. RESULTS: Five studies (182 participants) were included. Patients receiving GLP-1 agonists experienced greater weight loss (- 3.81 kg; 95% CI - 5.14 to - 2.49; p < 0.01, I(2): 59.88%) compared to controls.

"Eating disorder psychopathology, psychiatric impairment, and symptom frequency of atypical anorexia nervosa versus anorexia nervosa: A systematic review and meta-analysis.",Johnson-Munguia S; Negi S; Chen Y; Thomeczek ML; Forbush KT,"OBJECTIVES: Restrictive eating disorders (EDs) occur across the weight spectrum, but historically more focus has been given to anorexia nervosa (AN) than atypical anorexia nervosa (atypAN). AtypAN's relegation to a diagnosis in the ""other specified feeding and eating disorder"" (OSFED) category and paucity of research surrounding atypAN invariably implies a less clinically severe ED. However, a growing body of research has begun to question the assumption that atypAN is less severe than AN. The current review and meta-analysis aimed to provide a comprehensive review to compare atypAN and AN on measures of eating disorder psychopathology, impairment, and symptom frequency to test whether atypAN is truly less clinically severe than AN. METHODS: Twenty articles that reported on atypAN and AN for at least one of the variables of interest were retrieved from PsycInfo, PubMed, and ProQuest. RESULTS: For eating-disorder psychopathology, results indicated that differences were nonsignificant for most indicators; however, atypAN was associated with significantly higher shape concern, weight concern, drive for thinness, body dissatisfaction, and overall eating-disorder psychopathology than AN. Results indicated that atypAN and AN did not significantly differ on clinical impairment or the frequency of inappropriate compensatory behaviors, whereas there was a significantly higher frequency of objective binge episodes in AN (vs. atypAN). DISCUSSION: Overall, findings indicated that, in contrast to the current classification system, atypAN and AN were not clinically distinct. Results underscore the need for equal access to treatment and equal insurance coverage for restrictive EDs across the weight spectrum. PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE: The current meta-analysis found that atypAN was associated with higher drive for thinness, body dissatisfaction, shape concern, weight concern, and overall eating-disorder psychopathology than AN; whereas AN was associated with higher frequency of objective binge eating.

Taking a Deeper Dive Into OSFED Subtypes: A Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review.,Dang TB; Hughes EK; Dang AB; Lai HY; Lee J; Liu S; Portingale J; Fuller-Tyszkiewicz M; Krug I,"OBJECTIVE: To compare all other specified feeding or eating disorders (OSFED) groups (atypical anorexia nervosa [AN], purging disorder [PD], night eating syndrome [NES], subthreshold bulimia nervosa [sub-BN], and subthreshold binge-eating disorder [sub-BED]) to threshold eating disorders (EDs [AN, BN, and BED]) and control groups (CGs) on measures of eating and general psychopathology. METHOD: We conducted a comprehensive search in PsycINFO, Medline, Embase, and CINAHL on all published studies from January 2013 to February 2024 using DSM-5 diagnostic criteria via clinical interviews or well-established diagnostic tools. We also undertook a quality appraisal using an adapted version of the Downs and Black criteria and registered the review with PROSPERO (ID: CRD42022314495). RESULTS: Overall, our meta-analyses (n = 33 eligible studies) indicated that the combined OSFED and several specific OSFED subtypes displayed comparable levels of eating psychopathology to full-threshold EDs. Our systematic review (n = 33 eligible studies) found individuals with OSFED to have comparable levels of eating and general psychopathology to full-threshold EDs, but higher levels of eating and general psychopathology than CGs. These findings were specifically attributed to atypical AN and NES. There was a lack of evidence available for sub-BN and sub-BED. Studies mainly met the quality appraisal criteria.

Effect of cognitive remediation therapy in anorexia nervosa: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Alserihi AR; Hubayni WA; Alotaibi SH; Bahkali S; Alqurashi S; Abualola MS; Alsaleh AM,"BACKGROUND: Anorexia nervosa (AN) can significantly affect cognitive well-being. Cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) is regarded as one of the effective treatments for cognitive impairment in some mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and attention deficit. For this reason, this systematic review and meta-analysis aim to assess the effectiveness of CRT in patients with AN. METHODS: We conducted a search of Medline, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from the inception of each database through April 8, 2023. Randomized clinical trials evaluating the effectiveness of CRT in comparison to placebo or other psychological treatments in patients with AN were included. The quality of the studies was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. For meta-analysis, effect sizes were measured using mean difference (MD) utilizing the random-effects model and inverse variance (IV) technique. To evaluate the certainty of the evidence, we applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. The study was registered in PROSPERO, ID: CRD42023411784. RESULTS: In the systematic review, six studies were included, of which four underwent meta-analysis. Among these, three trials encompassing 413 participants showed that CRT was associated with improved cognitive flexibility compared to control at the end of treatment (MD = -0.21, 95% CI [-0.44, 0.02], P=0.81, I(2) = 0%). In two trials with 143 patients, those who received CRT showed similar effects on the severity of AN symptoms compared to the control group in the self-reporting questionnaires: EDE-Q (MD = -0.25, 95% CI [-0.76, 0.27], P=0.77, I(2) = 0%) and EDEQOL (MD = -0.19, 95% CI [-0.41, 0.03], P=0.84, I(2) = 0%). CONCLUSION: CRT did not show a statistically significant difference compared to the control group in improving abstract thinking skills and quality of life in individuals with AN. That indicates that CRT's efficacy remains inconclusive. Further research with larger, more diverse samples is needed to determine its long-term effects and potential benefits.

Characteristics of autism spectrum disorders are associated with longer duration of anorexia nervosa: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Saure E; Laasonen M; Lepistö-Paisley T; Mikkola K; Ålgars M; Raevuori A,"OBJECTIVE: Anorexia nervosa (AN) is associated with neuropsychological characteristics such as impairments in central coherence, cognitive flexibility, and emotion recognition. The same features also manifest in autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and have been suggested to be associated with illness prolongation in AN. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to examine whether pronounced neuropsychological characteristics related to ASD are associated with illness duration in AN. METHOD: Four databases (Medline, PsycINFO, Scopus, PubMed) were searched for eligible studies. Search terms were (a) ""anorexia nervosa"" and (b) ""cognitive flexibility"" or ""set-shifting"" or ""central coherence"" or ""emotion recognition"" or ""theory of mind"". The final sample consisted of 53 studies. Duration of AN was divided into three categories in order to investigate differences between the groups with varying illness duration. The meta-analysis was performed with Review Manager using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Deficits in central coherence, cognitive flexibility, and emotion recognition were pronounced among individuals with prolonged AN compared to those with shorter illness duration. DISCUSSION: A prolonged course of AN appears to be associated with underlying neuropsychological characteristics that are also distinctive to ASD. Neuropsychological impairments may lead to prolonged AN, and prolonged illness may contribute to the subsequent ""neurological scar effect,"" further strengthening these impairments.",2020,Jul,Int J Eat Disord,53,7,1056-1079,,10.1002/eat.23259,32181530,#267,Saure 2020,,Longer term outcomes; psychological comorbidities,
Pathways to improve early intervention for eating disorders: Findings from a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Radunz M; Ali K; Wade TD,"OBJECTIVE: Treatment-seeking rates among eating disorder (ED) populations are relatively low, with only one in four individuals seeking help. Previous research has identified many factors that might be associated with help-seeking in EDs, but to date no review has investigated the quantitative association between these factors and actual help-seeking behavior. The aim of the current review was to synthesize the relevant quantitative literature on factors (i.e., perceived barriers, characteristics associated with treatment seeking, demographic variables) associated with help-seeking using meta-analytic strategies, as well as provide recommendations on future early intervention research strategies to promote early help-seeking. METHOD: Overall, 19 studies were included, identifying 141 perceived barriers (e.g., stigma) or individual characteristics (e.g., BMI, duration of illness) and 56 demographic variables (e.g., ethnicity), which were synthesized into 24 unique variables. RESULTS: Less help-seeking was predicted by higher levels of denial and less perceived ability of others to provide help. DISCUSSION: Given the small number of studies these results should be considered preliminary. Future studies should consider barriers to help-seeking when creating early intervention approaches. To improve help-seeking rates we suggest the use of targeted psychoeducational materials and co-design with people with lived experience when developing new strategies. PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE: The present study addresses a significant gap in the literature by synthesizing factors associated with help-seeking, with the aim of informing early intervention strategies to promote early help-seeking in eating disorder populations. Denial of illness and perceived inability of others to provide help were associated with lower help-seeking. Future studies should consider barriers to help-seeking and co-design with people with lived experience when creating new early intervention strategies.",2023,Feb,Int J Eat Disord,56,2,314-330,,10.1002/eat.23845,36346008,#274,Radunz 2023,,ED phenomenology; Psychological treatment,
Is self-compassion relevant to the pathology and treatment of eating and body image concerns? A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Turk F; Waller G,"Eating disorders are severe mental health conditions, with substantial consequences for health and quality of life. Such disorders are strongly associated with body image concerns. It is important to consider treatments that might enhance our ability to treat such cases. Recently, there has been a growing body of research on self-compassion in relation to such problems. However, we are not yet clear about the extent of such effects, given the range of studies and methodologies used. Therefore, a systematic literature review was carried out using four key databases. Meta-analysis was used to reach conclusions about the size of the effects and moderators. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted with 59 studies. Higher self-compassion was associated with lower eating pathology, reduced body image concerns, and greater positive body image, with medium to strong effect sizes (respectively, r = -0.34, r = -0.45, r = 0.52). Furthermore, self-compassion interventions for eating pathology and body image were effective, and superior to control groups (respectively, g = 0.58, g = 0.39). These findings support the role of self-compassion in understanding and addressing eating and body image concerns.

E-mental health interventions for the treatment and prevention of eating disorders: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis.,Linardon J; Shatte A; Messer M; Firth J; Fuller-Tyszkiewicz M,"OBJECTIVES: E-mental health (digital) interventions can help overcome existing barriers that stand in the way of people receiving help for an eating disorder (ED). Although e-mental health interventions for treating and preventing EDs have been met with enthusiasm, earlier reviews brought attention to poor quality of evidence, and offered solutions to enhance their evidence base. To assess developments in the field, we conducted an updated meta-analysis on the efficacy of e-mental health interventions for treating and preventing EDs, paying attention to whether trial quality and outcomes have improved in recent trials. We also assessed whether user-centered design principles have been implemented in existing digital interventions. METHOD: Four databases were searched for RCTs of digital interventions for treating and preventing EDs. Thirty-six RCTs (28 prevention- and 8 treatment-focused) were included. RESULTS: Some evidence that study quality improved in recent prevention-focused trials was found. Few trials involved the end-user in the design or development stage of the intervention. Issues with intervention engagement were noted, and 1 in 4 participants dropped out from prevention- and treatment-focused trials. Digital interventions were more effective than control conditions in reducing established risk factors and symptoms in prevention- (g's = 0.19 to 0.43) and treatment-focused trials (g's = 0.29 to 0.69), respectively. Effect sizes have not increased in recent trials. Few trials compared a digital intervention with a face-to-face intervention. Whether digital interventions can prevent ED onset is unclear. CONCLUSION: Digital interventions are a promising approach to ED treatment and prevention, but improvements are still needed. Three key recommendations are provided.

Effectiveness of written emotional disclosure interventions for eating disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Wang Y; Xu T; Tao Y; Cai X,"BACKGROUND: Eating disorders are illnesses that can seriously impair the health and wellbeing of patients. Written emotional disclosure has been recognized as a therapeutic technique that may be helpful in aiding patients' emotional and psychological adjustment. However, it is unclear what favorable effects eating disorder patients can derive from written emotional disclosure therapy. This study aimed to review the effectiveness of written emotional disclosure in treating eating disorders using a systematic review and meta-analysis. OBJECTIVE: This study was to examine the validity of written emotional disclosure intervention for eating disorders as well as to provide guidelines for the management of eating disorders in patients. METHODS: Researchers independently developed inclusion and exclusion criteria according to the PICOS principle and systematically searched English literature databases such as PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, EBSCO, Embase, and so on, from the time of library construction to December 2023. Cochrane Risk of Bias version 2 (RoB 2) was used to evaluate studies included in this review. All the studies included in this study were randomized controlled trials. Accurate information was extracted and then subjected to meta-analysis with Review Manager 5.4 software. The credibility of the evidence of the studies was assessed using GRADEprofiler 3.6 software. RESULTS: The final analysis included 13 randomized controlled trials involving 1,444 participants. The written emotional disclosure intervention can decrease eating disorder symptoms scores (SMD = -0.20, 95% CI [-0.34, -0.05], Z = 2.59, p = 0.01), body dissatisfaction scores (SMD = 0.37, 95% CI [0.21, 0.52], Z = 4.59, p < 0.001), and thin ideal internalization score (SMD = 0.42, 95% CI [0.22, 0.62], Z = 4.12, p < 0.001). Anxiety scores (MD = 0.43, 95% CI [-0.77, 1.63], Z = 0.70, p = 0.48), depression scores (MD = -0.66, 95% CI [-1.78, 0.47], Z = 1.14, p = 0.25) and negative affect scores (SMD = 0.51, 95% CI [-0.24, 1.27], Z = 1.33, p = 0.18), with no statistically significant differences. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, this systematic review analyzed the existing literature and showed that written emotional disclosure intervention is effective in alleviating eating disorder symptoms and patients' body image problems, but there is insufficient evidence in alleviating depression, anxiety, and negative affect. However, the evidence is limited. Therefore, more research is needed in the future to further enrich the evidence for written emotional disclosure intervention in the field of eating disorders.

The impact of weight loss interventions on disordered eating symptoms in people with overweight and obesity: a systematic review & meta-analysis.,Tsompanaki E; Koutoukidis DA; Wren G; Tong H; Theodoulou A; Wang D; Park RJ; Jebb SA; Aveyard P,"BACKGROUND: It is unclear whether weight loss interventions worsen disordered eating in people living with overweight/obesity. We aimed to systematically evaluate the association between weight loss interventions and disordered eating. METHODS: Six databases were searched from inception until September 2024. Trials of weight loss interventions in people with overweight/obesity were included if they reported a validated score for disordered eating on either the Eating Disorder Examination Interview or the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire pre- and post-intervention. Interventions included behavioural weight loss programmes (BWL) and pharmacotherapy licenced for weight loss, with or without concurrent psychological support, provided for at least 4 weeks. Pooled standardised mean differences (SMD) in scores of disordered eating were calculated using random effects meta-analyses. Risk of bias (RoB) was assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool and the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for randomised and single-arm trials, respectively (PROSPERO ID: CRD42023404792). FINDINGS: Thirty-eight studies with 66 eligible arms (61 interventions: 29 BWL, 11 BWL + pharmacotherapy, 20 BWL + psychological intervention, 1 pharmacotherapy + psychological intervention) and 3364 participants in total were included. The mean weight change was -4.7 kg (95% CI: -5.7, -3.7). Compared with baseline, disordered eating scores improved by -1.47 SMD units (95% CI: -1.67, -1.27, p < 0.001, I(2) = 94%) at intervention completion (median of 4 months). Seven randomised trials that directly compared a weight loss intervention to no/minimal intervention reported an improvement of -0.49 SMD units (95% CI, -0.93, -0.04, p = 0.0035, I(2) = 73%). Sub-group analyses showed: (a) disordered eating scores improved more in people with an eating disorder at baseline compared with people without high scores, (b) no clear evidence that the association depended upon intervention type, and (c) disordered eating scores improved more in trials rated at low overall RoB. INTERPRETATION: Despite heterogeneity in effect size, weight loss interventions consistently improved disordered eating scores. These findings provide reassurance that weight loss interventions might not worsen disordered eating and may improve it.

Serum and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in individuals with eating disorders (EDs): a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Shobeiri P; Bagherieh S; Mirzayi P; Kalantari A; Mirmosayyeb O; Teixeira AL; Rezaei N,"BACKGROUND: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is essential for neuronal survival, differentiation, development, and plasticity. Evidence suggests that fluctuations in peripheral levels (i.e., plasma or serum) of BDNF are associated with eating behaviors. Nevertheless, the findings are inconsistent. The purpose of this study is to determine if serum or plasma levels of BDNF are altered in individuals with eating disorders (EDs) compared to controls. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of the core electronic medical databases from inception to March 2022 and identified observational studies that compared individuals with EDs to controls without EDs on serum or plasma levels of BDNF. R version 4.0.4 was used for all visualizations and calculations. RESULTS: The current meta-analysis comprised 15 studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Subjects with EDs (n = 795) showed lower BDNF levels compared to non-EDs controls (n = 552) (SMD: - 0.49, 95% CI [- 0.89; - 0.08], p-value = 0.01). Moreover, subgroup analysis was conducted based on the specimen (plasma and serum), which revealed no statistically significant difference in the levels of BDNF between the two subgroups (p-value = 0.92). Additionally, meta-regression results revealed that publication year, mean age of the individuals with EDs, NOS scores, and the number of individuals with EDs collectively accounted for 25.99% percent of the existing heterogeneity.

Association of 5-HTR2A -1438A/G polymorphism with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa: A meta-analysis.,Yan P; Gao B; Wang S; Li J; Song M,"Although a number of studies have been conducted on the association of -1438A/G polymorphism in serotonin 2A receptor (5-HTR2A) gene with anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN), the results remained inconsistent. We thus performed a meta-analysis to clarify the effects of -1438A/G polymorphism on the risk of AN and BN. PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, CNKI, Weipu and Wanfang databases were searched for eligible studies. Pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) were calculated to estimate the strength of the association. Subgroup analysis was also performed by ethnicity. In total, 17 studies were included for the meta-analysis, of which 15 studies containing 2028 cases and 2725 controls were used for AN analysis and 7 studies containing 505 cases and 1129 controls for BN analysis. The results showed -1438A/G polymorphism was significantly associated with the risk of AN in four genetic models (allele model, A vs. G: OR = 1.31, 95 % CI = 1.11-1.64, P = 0.003; recessive model, AA vs. GA + GG: OR = 1.69, 95 % CI = 1.28-2.23, P = 0.000; dominant model, AA + GA vs. GG: OR = 1.35, 95 % CI = 1.02-1.79, P = 0.037; co-dominant model, AA vs. GG: OR = 1.94, 95 % CI = 1.29-2.92, P = 0.002) in Caucasians, but not in Asians. We failed to observe a significant association between -1438A/G polymorphism and the risk of BN either in overall or in Caucasian population. The present meta-analysis indicated that A allele and AA genotype of 5-HTR2A -1438A/G polymorphism may contribute to higher risk of AN, especially in Caucasians. However, this polymorphism was not associated with the susceptibility to BN.",2021,Jun,Neurosci Lett,755,,135918,,10.1016/j.neulet.2021.135918,33940056,#287,Yan 2021,,Anorexia; Bulimia; Genetics,
Differences in Alpha Diversity of Gut Microbiota in Neurological Diseases.,Li Z; Zhou J; Liang H; Ye L; Lan L; Lu F; Wang Q; Lei T; Yang X; Cui P; Huang J,"BACKGROUND: Neurological diseases are difficult to diagnose in time, and there is currently a lack of effective predictive methods. Previous studies have indicated that a variety of neurological diseases cause changes in the gut microbiota. Alpha diversity is a major indicator to describe the diversity of the gut microbiota. At present, the relationship between neurological diseases and the alpha diversity of the gut microbiota remains unclear. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search of Pubmed and Bioproject databases up to January 2021. Six indices were used to measure alpha diversity, including community richness (observed species, Chao1 and ACE), community diversity (Shannon, Simpson), and phylogenetic diversity (PD). Random-effects meta-analyses on the standardized mean difference (SMD) were carried out on the alpha diversity indices. Subgroup analyses were performed to explore the sources of interstudy heterogeneity. Meta-analysis was performed on articles by matching the age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) of the disease group with the control group. Meanwhile, subgroup analysis was performed to control the variability of the sequencing region, platform, geographical region, instrument, and diseases. The area under the curve (AUC) value of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was calculated to assess the prediction effectiveness of the microbial alpha diversity indices. RESULTS: We conducted a meta-analysis of 24 published studies on 16S rRNA gene amplified sequencing of the gut microbiota and neurological diseases from the Pubmed and Bioproject database (patients, n = 1,469; controls, n = 1,289). The pooled estimate demonstrated that there was no significant difference in the alpha diversity between patients and controls (P < 0.05). Alpha diversity decreased only in Parkinson's disease patients, while it increased in anorexia nervosa patients compared to controls. After adjusting for age, sex, BMI, and geographical region, none of the alpha diversity was associated with neurological diseases. In terms of Illumina HiSeq 2000 and the V3-V5 sequencing region, the results showed that alpha diversity increased significantly in comparison with the controls, while decreased in Illumina HiSeq 2500. ROC curves suggested that alpha diversity could be used as a biomarker to predict the AD (Simpson, AUC= 0.769, P = 0.0001), MS (observed species, AUC= 0.737, P = 0.001), schizophrenia (Chao1, AUC = 0.739, P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Our review summarized the relationship between alpha diversity of the gut microbiota and neurological diseases. The alpha diversity of gut microbiota could be a promising predictor for AD, schizophrenia, and MS, but not for all neurological diseases.",2022,,Front Neurosci,16,,879318,,10.3389/fnins.2022.879318,35837118,#289,Li 2022,,Anorexia; ED is a sub-group analysis only,
The association between disordered eating and psychosis in clinical and non-clinical populations: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Drymonitou G; McCulloch A; Parry S; Gough R; Moreira Cruz R; Mostoufi M; Jawad M; Newman C; Harding D; Salazar de Pablo G; Jewell T,"BACKGROUND: Eating disorders and psychotic disorders represent two of the most serious psychiatric conditions. Emerging lines of evidence from genetic and epidemiological studies suggest that these disorders may commonly co-occur. This systematic review investigated the association between these disorders across community and clinical populations. METHOD: A systematic review was preregistered (CRD42021231771) and conducted according to PRISMA guidelines. Web of Science, PsycINFO and Medline were searched for articles on the association and comorbidity between psychosis and eating disorders up to the 26th February 2024. A random effects meta-analysis was conducted for studies reporting comorbidity of eating disorders and psychotic disorders based on clinical diagnosis or interview measures, to estimate prevalence of the comorbidity between these disorders. A narrative synthesis was conducted for all other studies and grouped by sample (general population, eating disorders or psychotic disorders). RESULTS: In total 43 studies met inclusion criteria for the systematic review and 16 were included in the meta-analysis. Findings suggest substantial comorbidity between eating disorders and psychotic disorders, with a pooled comorbidity prevalence of 8% (CI: 3, 14) based on clinical diagnosis or interview measures. Studies using self-report questionnaires also highlight the association between eating disorders and psychosis across clinical and community populations.

Non-suicidal self-injury among individuals with an eating disorder: A systematic review and prevalence meta-analysis.,Kirkpatrick RH; Breton E; Biorac A; Munoz DP; Booij L,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to quantify the prevalence of non-suicidal self-injury across eating disorders (EDs) and within diagnostic categories through systematic review and proportional, or so-called prevalence, meta-analysis. METHOD: Included studies had to contain individuals with a verified diagnosis of an ED. The last literature search was conducted on September 11, 2023, for studies published on or before September 2023 without a restriction on earliest publication year. Results were synthesized and analyzed using the ""metaprop"" package in R and presented using forest plots. Bias was assessed by a Peters' regression test and funnel plot. RESULTS: 79 studies published between 1985 and 2023 were included encompassing 32,334 individuals with an ED. Importantly, 42 studies were not included in any other meta-analyses on self-injury in EDs to date. Overall prevalence of non-suicidal self-injury was 34.59% (95%CI = 30.49-38.81). Prevalence in anorexia nervosa restrictive type, binge/purge type, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder and other specified feeding/eating disorder were 23.19% (95%CI = 16.96-30.03%), 41.98% (95%CI = 32.35-51.91%), 36.97% (95%CI = 30.69-43.46%), 21.21% (95%CI = 14.93-28.12%) and 37.65% (95%CI = 28.59-47.09%), respectively. Prevalence estimations could not be estimated for other ED categories due to lack of a sufficient number of studies. DISCUSSION: Non-suicidal self-injury is prevalent across both binge/purge and restrictive EDs. Considering the transdiagnostic nature of self-injurious behaviors in ED, the results highlight the importance of assessment and monitoring of self-injury in people with ED, irrespective of specific diagnoses. The method of determining self-injury varied across studies and may limit this study. PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE: This study highlights the prevalence of self-injury across eating disorders irrespective of diagnosis and within specific EDs. While diagnoses known to exhibit self-injurious behaviors (e.g., bulimia nervosa, anorexia nervosa binge/purge subtype) demonstrated the highest prevalence of self-injury, all diagnoses were found to have a prevalence greater than 20%. These findings suggest the importance of assessing and monitoring all individuals with an eating disorder for the presence of self-injury.",2024,Feb,Int J Eat Disord,57,2,223-248,,10.1002/eat.24088,38041221,#293,Kirkpatrick 2024,,Symptom correlates of ED,

An overview and investigation of relapse predictors in anorexia nervosa: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,de Rijk ESJ; Almirabi D; Robinson L; Schmidt U; van Furth EF; Slof-Op 't Landt MCT,"OBJECTIVE: An extensive number of predictors has been examined across the literature to improve knowledge of relapse in anorexia nervosa (AN). These studies provide various recovery and relapse definitions, follow-up durations and relapse rates. The current study summarizes these values and predictors of relapse in AN in a review and meta-analysis. METHOD: The study was executed according to PRISMA guidelines. Different databases were searched and studies in which participants did not receive an official clinical diagnosis were excluded. A quality analysis was performed using the National Institute of Health's Study Quality Assessment Tool. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted to summarize data. RESULTS: Definitions of relapse and recovery were diverse. During an average follow-up period of 31 months an average relapse rate of 37% was found. Predictive variables from 28 studies were grouped in six categories: age and sex, symptoms and behaviors, AN subtype and duration, weight or weight change, comorbidity, and personality. The studies were characterized by non-significant and contradictory results. Meta-analyses were performed for the predictors age, AN duration, pre-treatment BMI, post-treatment BMI and depression. These yielded significant effects for post-treatment BMI and depression: higher pre-treatment depression (SMD = .40 CI [.21-.59] and lower post-treatment BMI (SMD = -.35 CI [-.63 to -.07]) increased relapse chances in AN. DISCUSSION: Our results emphasized a lack of sufficiently powered studies, consistent results, and robust findings. Solely post-treatment BMI and pre-treatment depression predicted relapse. Future research should use uniform definitions, larger samples and better designs, to improve our understanding of relapse in AN. PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE: Knowledge about predictors is important to understand high relapse rates. Our study performed a review and meta-analysis of relapse predictors in AN. Related to the heterogeneity in studies examining predictors, an overview of relapse and recovery definitions, follow-up durations and relapse rates for AN was provided. Significant effects were found for post-treatment BMI and pre-treatment depression. More studies with uniform definitions are needed to improve clinical implications.",2024,Jan,Int J Eat Disord,57,1,Mar-26,,10.1002/eat.24059,37855175,#295,deRijkESJ 2024,,Anorexia; Longer term outcomes,
Investigating the Presence of Autistic Traits and Prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder Symptoms in Anorexia Nervosa: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,Inal-Kaleli I; Dogan N; Kose S; Bora E,"OBJECTIVE: The present meta-analysis aims to assess whether individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN) demonstrate elevated autistic traits, to explore potential associations between autistic traits and eating disorder symptoms; as well as to estimate the prevalence of a positive screen for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) assessed via Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS), in AN. METHOD: A systematic literature search was conducted in PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and Web of Science in August 2023 and later updated in April 2024 to identify relevant studies. Twenty-two studies with 1172 AN patients and 2747 healthy controls (HCs) met the inclusion criteria. RESULTS: There was a significant difference between AN and HC groups in autistic traits (g = 0.88, CI = 0.65-1.12), and a significant but modest correlation was found between autistic traits and severity of eating disorder symptoms (r = 0.28, CI = 0.11-0.44). Proportion meta-analysis indicated that 29% (CI = 0.19-0.38) of children and adults scored above the cut-off for ASD. DISCUSSION: The current findings suggest that AN frequently overlaps with both autistic traits and autistic symptomatology. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate autism and autistic traits in individuals with AN to tailor individualized treatment plans.",2025,Jan,Int J Eat Disord,58,1,66-90,,10.1002/eat.24307,39530423,#298,Inal-Kaleli 2025,,psychological comorbidities,
Third-wave interventions for eating disorders in adolescence - systematic review with meta-analysis.,Buerger A; Vloet TD; Haber L; Geissler JM,"CONTEXT: Third-wave therapies have demonstrated efficacy as a treatment option for EDs in adulthood. Data on the suitability for EDs in adolescence are lacking. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the efficacy of third-wave interventions to reduce ED symptoms in adolescents in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and uncontrolled studies. DATA SOURCES: We systematically reviewed the databases PubMed (1976-January 2021), PsycINFO (1943-January 2021), and the Cochrane database (1995-January 2021) for English-language articles on third-wave therapies. References were screened for further publications of interest. STUDY SELECTION: RCTs and pre-post studies without control group, comprising patients aged 11-21 years (mean age = 15.6 years) with an ED diagnosis (anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, eating disorder not otherwise specified) investigating the efficacy of third-wave psychological interventions were included. Efficacy had to be evaluated according to the Eating Disorder Examination or Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire, the Eating Disorder Inventory-2, the Eating Disorder Inventory-3, or the Structured Interview for Anorexic and Bulimic Disorders for DSM-IV and ICD-10. The outcome assessed in the meta-analysis was the EDE total score. DATA EXTRACTION: Independent extraction of data by two authors according to a pre-specified data extraction sheet and quality indicators. DATA SYNTHESIS: We identified 1000 studies after removal of duplicates, assessed the full texts of 48 articles for eligibility, and included 12 studies with a total of 487 participants (female 97.3%/male 2.6%) in the qualitative synthesis and seven studies in the meta-analysis. Articles predominantly reported uncontrolled pre-post trials of low quality, with only two published RCTs. Treatments focused strongly on dialectical behaviour therapy (n = 11). We found moderate effects of third-wave therapies on EDE total score interview/questionnaire for all EDs (d = - 0.67; z = - 5.53; CI95% = - 0.83 to - 0.59). Descriptively, the effects appeared to be stronger in patients with BN and BED. CONCLUSION: At this stage, it is not feasible to draw conclusions regarding the efficacy of third-wave interventions for the treatment of EDs in adolescence due to the low quality of the empirical evidence. Since almost all of the identified studies used DBT, it is unfortunately not possible to assess other third-wave treatments' efficacy.",2021,Jun,Borderline Personal Disord Emot Dysregul,8,1,20,,10.1186/s40479-021-00158-6,34127069,#300,Buerger 2021,,Adolescents; Psychotherapy,
The prevalence of substance use disorders and substance use in anorexia nervosa: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Devoe DJ; Dimitropoulos G; Anderson A; Bahji A; Flanagan J; Soumbasis A; Patten SB; Lange T; Paslakis G,"AIM: Individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN) often present with substance use and substance use disorders (SUDs). However, the prevalence of substance use and SUDs in AN has not been studied in-depth, especially the differences in the prevalence of SUDs between AN types [e.g., AN-R (restrictive type) and AN-BP (binge-eating/purge type]. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the prevalence of SUDs and substance use in AN samples. METHOD: Systematic database searches of the peer-reviewed literature were conducted in the following online databases: MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, and CINAHL from inception to January 2021. We restricted review eligibility to peer-reviewed research studies reporting the prevalence for either SUDs or substance use in individuals with AN. Random-effects meta-analyses using Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformations were performed on eligible studies to estimate pooled proportions and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Fifty-two studies met the inclusion criteria, including 14,695 individuals identified as having AN (mean age: 22.82 years). Random pooled estimates showed that substance use disorders had a 16% prevalence in those with AN (AN-BP = 18% vs. AN-R = 7%). Drug abuse/dependence disorders had a prevalence of 7% in AN (AN-BP = 9% vs. AN-R = 5%). In studies that looked at specific abuse/dependence disorders, there was a 10% prevalence of alcohol abuse/dependence in AN (AN-BP = 15% vs. AN-R = 3%) and a 6% prevalence of cannabis abuse/dependence (AN-BP = 4% vs. AN-R = 0%). In addition, in terms of substance use, there was a 37% prevalence for caffeine use, 29% prevalence for alcohol use, 25% for tobacco use, and 14% for cannabis use in individuals with AN. CONCLUSION: This is the most comprehensive meta-analysis on the comorbid prevalence of SUDs and substance use in persons with AN, with an overall pooled prevalence of 16%. Comorbid SUDs, including drugs, alcohol, and cannabis, were all more common in AN-BP compared to AN-R throughout. Therefore, clinicians should be aware of the high prevalence of SUD comorbidity and substance use in individuals with AN. Finally, clinicians should consider screening for SUDs and integrating treatments that target SUDs in individuals with AN. Individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN) may also present with substance use or have a substance use disorder (SUDs). Thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the prevalence of substance use and substance use disorders in individuals with AN. We examined published studies that reported the prevalence of either substance use or SUDs in individuals with AN. We found that substance use disorders had a 16% prevalence and that drug abuse/dependence disorders had a prevalence of 7% in those with AN. These rates were much higher in individuals with binge-eating/purging type compared to the restrictive AN. However, many specific substance use disorders and substance use types were low in individuals with AN. Nonetheless, clinicians should be aware of the high prevalence of SUD comorbidity and substance use in individuals with AN.",2021,Dec,J Eat Disord,9,1,161,,10.1186/s40337-021-00516-3,34895358,#301,Devoe 2021,,Anorexia; Prevalence rates; psychological comorbidities,
Changes of symptoms of eating disorders (ED) and their related psychological health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Haghshomar M; Shobeiri P; Brand S; Rossell SL; Akhavan Malayeri A; Rezaei N,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic and its related social restrictions have profoundly affected people's mental health. It can be assumed that symptomatic behaviors and mental health of individuals with eating disorders (ED) deteriorated during this time. To get a thorough overview, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis with the following aims: First, to provide a comprehensive overview of symptoms of ED during the COVID-19-related confinement; second, to identify psychological mechanisms which impacted the emergence and maintenance of ED symptoms; third, to describe changes of daily routine and changes of access to healthcare in individuals with ED during confinement. METHODS: We searched Embase, PubMed, and Scopus databases for observational studies published between January 1st, 2020, to July 1st, 2021, which investigated the symptomatology of ED during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: After the screening, 13 studies with 7848 participants were included in the present systematic review and meta-analysis. The overall pooled prevalence of exacerbation of binge eating, food restriction, purging behaviors, and concerns about food intake in the pooled sample of 7848 was 59.65% (95% CI: 49.30%; 69.60%), and the overall prevalence of improved symptoms of ED in the pooled sample of 741 individuals was 9.37% (95% CI: 3.92%; 16.57%). Furthermore, COVID-19-related social restrictions negatively impacted the psychological health, daily routines, and physical activity of individuals with ED. More specifically, symptoms of anxiety and depression related to ED were increased significantly over time. However, there were also positive aspects to the COVID-19 pandemic. The main positive consequences included more emotional support from the family, less pressure to engage in social activities, and more flexible meal planning. Individuals with ED reported having difficulties getting access to healthcare centers and using telemedicine. They also found a hard time communicating via online sessions. CONCLUSIONS: According to our interpretation, based on the data included in the systematic review and meta-analysis, the COVID-19 pandemic and its related social restrictions detrimentally impacted the mental health of majority of individuals with ED. Limited and impaired access to healthcare interventions appeared to have further exacerbated mental health issues of individuals with ED. Given this background, it seems that individuals with ED demand more attention during the COVID-19 crisis, and it is necessary to ensure that their course of treatment remains uninterrupted.",2022,Apr,J Eat Disord,10,1,51,,10.1186/s40337-022-00550-9,35418108,#304,Haghshomar 2022,,COVID-19,
Potential shortcomings in current studies on the effect of intranasal oxytocin in Anorexia Nervosa and healthy controls - A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Hasselbalch KC; Lanng KR; Birkeland M; Sjögren M,"RATIONALE: The psychopathology of anorexia nervosa (AN) includes altered social cognition and information processing of fear and anxiety. Oxytocin, a neuromodulating hormone, may influence these functions and could be valuable for the treatment of AN. OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed at reviewing the effect of intranasal oxytocin (IN-OT) on attentional bias (AB) and emotion recognition (ER) in AN. METHODS: A systematic literature review was done for free-text and the MeSH-terms: anorexia nervosa, feeding and eating disorders, and oxytocin. Six publications, reporting from 4 unique clinical trials, were included in this review. A meta-analysis was conducted to examine the effects of IN-OT on AB towards food images and ER on healthy controls (HC) and patients with AN. RESULTS: Overall, IN-OT did not influence AB towards food images (effect size = 0.20 [- 0.16, 0.57], p = 0.28) and had no effect on ER (effect size = - 0.01 [- 0.27, 0.26], p = 0.97) in patients with AN and healthy control (HC) subjects collectively. Assessing HC and AN separately in subgroup analyses did not show any significant effect on AB and ER in neither of the subgroups. All tests were done between 15 and 55 min post-administration of IN-OT, while peak concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid has been determined to be at 75 min. CONCLUSION: The current level of evidence is moderate showing no effect of IN-OT on AB or ER in AN. However, brain exposure may not have been sufficient which future studies with IN-OT need to ensure by considering dose and dose-to-task interval.",2020,Oct,Psychopharmacology (Berl),237,10,2891-2903,,10.1007/s00213-020-05626-5,32809046,#306,Hasselbalch 2020,,Anorexia; Neurocognition; Pharmacotherapy,

While several studies report substantial deficits in gray matter volume and cortical thickness in acutely underweight patients, others find no differences, or even increases in patients compared with healthy control subjects. Recent weight regain before scanning may explain some of this heterogeneity. To clarify the extent, magnitude, and dependencies of gray matter changes in AN, we conducted a prospective, coordinated meta-analysis of multicenter neuroimaging data. METHODS: We analyzed T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging scans assessed with standardized methods from 685 female patients with AN and 963 female healthy control subjects across 22 sites worldwide. In addition to a case-control comparison, we conducted a 3-group analysis comparing healthy control subjects with acutely underweight AN patients (n = 466) and partially weight-restored patients in treatment (n = 251). RESULTS: In AN, reductions in cortical thickness, subcortical volumes, and, to a lesser extent, cortical surface area were sizable (Cohen's d up to 0.95), widespread, and colocalized with hub regions. Highlighting the effects of undernutrition, these deficits were associated with lower body mass index in the AN sample and were less pronounced in partially weight-restored patients. CONCLUSIONS: The effect sizes observed for cortical thickness deficits in acute AN are the largest of any psychiatric disorder investigated in the ENIGMA (Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta Analysis) Consortium to date. These results confirm the importance of considering weight loss and renutrition in biomedical research on AN and underscore the importance of treatment engagement to prevent potentially long-lasting structural brain changes in this population.",2022,Nov,Biol Psychiatry,92,9,730-738,,10.1016/j.biopsych.2022.04.022,36031441,#311,Walton 2022,,,

METHODS: MEDLINE/PsycINFO databases were systematically searched for original studies documenting BD⇌ED comorbidity across the lifespan, from inception up until April 20(th), 2020. Random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression analyses were conducted, accounting for multiple moderators. RESULTS: Thirty-six studies involved 15,084 primary BD patients. Eleven studies encompassed 15,146 people with primary EDs. Binge eating disorder (BED) occurred in 12.5% (95%C.I.=9.4-16.6%, I(2)=93.48%) of BDs, while 9.1% (95%C.I.=3.3-22.6%) of BEDs endorsed BD. Bulimia Nervosa (BN) occurred in 7.4% (95%C.I.=6-10%) of people with BD, whereas 6.7% (95%C.I.=12-29.2%) of subjects with BN had a diagnosis of BD. Anorexia Nervosa (AN) occurred in 3.8% (95%C.I.=2-6%) of people with BDs; 2% (95%C.I.=1-2%) of BD patients had a diagnosis of AN. Overall, BD patients with EDs had higher odds of being female vs. non-ED controls. Several moderators yielded statistically significant differences both within- and between different types of BDs and EDs. LIMITATIONS: Scant longitudinal studies, especially across different EDs and pediatric samples. High heterogeneity despite subgroup comparisons. Limited discrimination of the quality of the evidence. CONCLUSIONS: The rates of BD⇌ED comorbidity vary across different diagnostic groups, more than they do according to the ""direction"" of BD⇌ED. Further primary studies should focus on the risks, chronology, clinical impact, and management of the onset of intertwined BD⇌ED across different ages, promoting a continuum approach.",2021,Feb,J Affect Disord,280,Pt A,409-431,,10.1016/j.jad.2020.11.015,33227671,#314,Fornaro 2021,,psychological comorbidities,
"Associations between bone mineral density, body composition and amenorrhoea in females with eating disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis.",Lopes MP; Robinson L; Stubbs B; Dos Santos Alvarenga M; Araújo Martini L; Campbell IC; Schmidt U,"BACKGROUND: Lower bone mineral density (BMD) increases the risk of osteoporosis in individuals with eating disorders (EDs), particularly women with anorexia nervosa (AN), making them susceptible to pain and fractures throughout adulthood. In AN, low weight, hypothalamic amenorrhoea, and longer illness duration are established risk factors for low BMD, and in people with other EDs a history of AN seems to be an important risk factor for low BMD. PURPOSE: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of BMD in individuals with EDs, including AN, bulimia nervosa (BN), binge-eating disorder (BED) and other specified feeding or eating disorders (OSFED) compared to healthy controls (HC). METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, electronic databases were reviewed and supplemented with a literature search until 2/2022 of publications measuring BMD (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry or dual photon absorptiometry) in females with any current ED diagnosis and a HC group. Primary outcomes were spine, hip, femur and total body BMD. Explanatory variables were fat mass, lean mass and ED clinical characteristics (age, illness duration, body mass index (BMI), amenorrhoea occurrence and duration, and oral contraceptives use). RESULTS: Forty-three studies were identified (N = 4163 women, mean age 23.4 years, min: 14.0, max: 37.4). No study with individuals with BED met the inclusion criteria. BMD in individuals with AN (total body, spine, hip, and femur), with BN (total body and spine) and with OSFED (spine) was lower than in HC. Meta-regression analyses of women with any ED (AN, BN or OSFED) (N = 2058) showed low BMI, low fat mass, low lean mass and being amenorrhoeic significantly associated with lower total body and spine BMD. In AN, only low fat mass was significantly associated with low total body BMD. CONCLUSION: Predictors of low BMD were low BMI, low fat mass, low lean mass and amenorrhoea, but not age or illness duration. In people with EDs, body composition measurement and menstrual status, in addition to BMI, are likely to provide a more accurate assessment of individual risk to low BMD and osteoporosis.",2022,Nov,J Eat Disord,10,1,173,,10.1186/s40337-022-00694-8,36401318,#315,Lopes 2022,,Medical complications; medical aspects of ED,
"COVID-19-related changes in eating disorder pathology, emotional and binge eating and need for care: a systematic review with frequentist and Bayesian meta-analyses.",Güzel Â; Mutlu NL; Molendijk M,"PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic has been a leading cause of stress and feelings of loss of control, both of which have been related to eating disorder (ED) pathology onset and deterioration. We aim to estimate the magnitude of changes in the prevalence rates of, and indicators for, ED psychopathology in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Pre-registered systematic review with frequentist and Bayesian meta-analyses. Searches for eligible studies were performed in PubMed, Web of Science and pre-print servers until January 15 2023. RESULTS: Our searches yielded 46 eligible studies reporting on a total of 4,688,559 subjects. These data provide strong evidence indicating increased rates of diagnosed and self-reported ED's and a concordant increased need for care in the face of the pandemic. ED symptom severity scores in patients were not elevated during the pandemic, except for those related to anorexia nervosa. On average, people in the general population report relatively high levels of emotional and binge eating during the pandemic, although the evidential strength for these associations is only anecdotal to moderate. Moderators of between-study heterogeneity were not detected. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our results suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with a wide spread negative effect on ED pathology in patient samples and the general population. The development of online prevention and intervention programs for EDs during stressful times like a pandemic is encouraged. A limitation is that the results reported here may be prone to biases, amongst others, self-report bias. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level I, systematic review and meta-analysis.

However, precise estimates of differences in prevalence between individuals with EDs and controls are unclear. We compared the prevalence of NSSI, suicidal ideation (SI), suicide attempts (SA), and deaths by suicide in controls and individuals with EDs. METHOD: We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, and CINAHL for peer-reviewed publications reporting the prevalence of NSSI and/or STBs in EDs and HC or PC group (PROSPERO: CRD42021286754). A series of random-effects meta-analyses were conducted to estimate pooled odds ratios (ORs) for NSSI, SI, SA, and death by suicide in EDs. RESULTS: Across 32 studies, individuals with an ED had a significantly increased prevalence of NSSI (HC: OR = 6.85 [95% CI: 3.60, 13.04]; PC: OR = 2.74 [95% CI: 1.49, 5.06]), SI (HC: OR = 3.63 [95% CI: 2.43, 5.41]; PC: OR = 3.10 [95% CI: 2.01, 4.78]), and SA (HC: OR = 5.16 [95% CI: 4.27, 6.24]; PC: OR = 1.37 [95% CI: 0.37, 4.99]) relative to HC and PC groups. A 2.93-times increased odd of death by suicide did not achieve statistical significance. There was a high-level of heterogeneity between studies. DISCUSSION: Our findings indicate that ED populations have an increased prevalence of NSSI, SI, and SA but not death by suicide compared to controls and emphasize the need for effective clinical strategies to address these behaviors in ED populations.

We aimed to systematically synthesise the prevalence of all the different categories of mental disorders to estimate the overall burden of psychiatric morbidity in the type 1 diabetes population. METHOD: The electronic database of OVID was searched, and retrieved papers were screened for eligibility by two independent reviewers. Data were extracted using a standardised data extraction form and the quality of included papers was assessed. Where possible, comparisons with control groups without type 1 diabetes were made. Prevalence data were synthesised into Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders version 5 categories, a narrative data-synthesis, and a subsequent meta-analysis where possible was conducted for mental disorder categories. RESULTS: Thirty-eight articles were included. Depressive, anxiety, and feeding and eating disorders were the most examined mental disorders. Studies utilising diagnostic interviews reported higher prevalence of mental disorders than in studies utilising clinical registers, with an up to 24-fold difference respectively. In studies with a control group, the prevalence for nearly every mental disorder were increased for the type 1 diabetes samples.

Systemic therapy in children and adolescents with mental disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Seidel DH; Markes M; Grouven U; Messow CM; Sieben W; Knelangen M; Oelkers-Ax R; Grümer S; Kölsch H; Kromp M; von Pluto Prondzinski M,"BACKGROUND: Systemic therapy (ST) is a psychotherapeutic intervention in complex human systems (both psychological and interpersonal). Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is an established treatment for children and adolescents with mental disorders. As methodologically rigorous systematic reviews on ST in this population are lacking, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the benefit and harm of ST (and ST as an add-on to CBT) with CBT in children and adolescents with mental disorders. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO and other sources for randomised controlled trials in 14 mental disorder classes for the above comparisons in respect of effects on patient-relevant outcomes (search date: 7/2022). Where possible, meta-analyses were performed and results were graded into 3 different evidence categories: ""proof"", ""indication"", or ""hint"" (or none of these categories). PRISMA standards were followed. RESULTS: Fifteen studies in 5 mental disorder classes with usable data were identified. 2079 patients (mean age: 10 to 19 years) were analysed. 12/15 studies and 29/30 outcomes showed a high risk of bias. In 2 classes, statistically significant and clinically relevant effects in favour of ST were found, supporting the conclusion of a hint of greater benefit of ST for mental and behavioural disorders due to psychoactive substance use and of ST as an add-on to CBT for obsessive-compulsive disorders. In 2 other classes (eating disorders; hyperkinetic disorders), there was no evidence of greater benefit or harm of ST. For affective disorders, a statistically significant effect to the disadvantage of ST was found for 1 outcome, supporting the conclusion of a hint of lesser benefit of ST. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show a hint of greater benefit of ST (or ST as an add-on to CBT) compared with CBT for 2 mental disorder classes in children and adolescents (mental and behavioural disorders due to psychoactive substance use, obsessive compulsive disorders). Given the importance of CBT as a control intervention, ST can therefore be considered a beneficial treatment option for children and adolescents with certain mental disorders.

Obsessive-compulsive symptoms worsened among people with obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, with a moderate effect size (N = 474 [six studies], SMD = -0.45 [95% CI, -0.82 to -0.08], I(2)  = 83%; very low certainty). We found a small association between the COVID-19 pandemic and reduced anxiety symptoms in people with mood, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive, and eating disorders (N = 3738 [six studies], SMD = 0.11 [95% CI, 0.02-0.19], I(2)  = 63%; very low certainty). No change in loneliness, depressive, or problematic eating symptoms was found. CONCLUSION: People with obsessive-compulsive and related disorders may benefit from additional monitoring during the COVID-19 pandemic and possibly future pandemics. Other psychiatric symptoms were stable in people with the specific disorders studied.

The efficacy of randomised controlled trials of cognitive behaviour therapy for perfectionism: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Galloway R; Watson H; Greene D; Shafran R; Egan SJ,"Perfectionism is a transdiagnostic process across anxiety, depression, and eating disorders. The aim of this systematic review was to examine the efficacy of self-help and face to face CBT for perfectionism in reducing perfectionism and anxiety, depression, and eating disorders. A total of 15 randomised controlled trials of CBT for perfectionism were identified (N = 912 participants; mean pooled age = 23 years) which met inclusion criteria. There were medium or large effect sizes found on perfectionism measures; personal standards (g = 0.57, 95% CI = 0.43-0.72), concern over mistakes (g = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.71-1.08) and clinical perfectionism (g = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.70-1.04). There were medium effects for symptoms of eating disorders (g = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.36-0.87) and depression (g = 0.60, 95% CI = 0.28-0.91), and a small-medium effect on anxiety (g = 0.42, 95% CI = 0.21-0.62). There was no publication bias found. Limitations included the small number of trials included and lack of active treatment comparisons. Results suggested that CBT for perfectionism is efficacious in reducing perfectionism and symptoms of depression, anxiety and eating disorders.

Prevalence of personality disorders in adults with binge eating disorder-A systematic review and Bayesian meta-analysis.,Senra H; Gaglianone CG; McPherson S; Unterrainer H,"Binge eating disorder (BED) is a complex mental health problem entailing high risk for obesity, overweight, and other psychiatric disorders. However, there is still unclear evidence of the prevalence of personality disorders (PDs) in BED patients. We conducted a systematic review and a Bayesian meta-analysis for studies examining the prevalence of any PD in adult BED patients. Data sources included PubMed, Cochrane library, EBSCO, PsycINFO, and Science Direct. A Bayesian meta-analysis was conducted to estimate effect sizes for the prevalence of any PD in BED patients. Twenty eligible articles were examined with a total of 2945 BED patients. Borderline personality disorder and ""Cluster C"" PD, particularly obsessive-compulsive and avoidant PD, were the most frequent PD found in BED patients. BED diagnosis was associated with 28% probability of a comorbid diagnosis of any PD (0.279, 95%CrI: [0.22, 0.34]), with high levels of between-study heterogeneity (τ = 0.61, 95% CrI [0.40, 0.90]). Sensitivity analysis suggested effect sizes ranging from 0.27 to 0.28. The high comorbidity of PDs in BED patients draws attention to the potential complexity of BED clinical presentations, including those that might also be comorbid with obesity. Clinical practice should address this complexity to improve care for BED and obesity patients.",2024,Mar,Obes Rev,25,3,e13669,,10.1111/obr.13669,38114201,#333,Senra 2024,,Binge-eating disorder; psychological comorbidities,
The prevalence of mental health outcomes among eating disorder patients during the COVID-19 pandemic: A meta-analysis.,Khraisat BR; Al-Jeady AM; Alqatawneh DA; Toubasi AA; AlRyalat SA,"BACKGROUND & AIMS: Patients with eating disorders (ED) are known to suffer from various psychological morbidities thus they are expected to be negatively impacted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our meta-analysis aims to evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the pooled prevalence of psychological comorbidities in ED patients. METHODS: Pubmed, Scopus, GoogleScholar, and medRxiv were searched using the keywords COVID19 and Eating Disorders and their related MeSH terms. The articles were included if they contained patients with diagnosed EDs and having evaluated their mental health disturbances during the COVID-19 pandemic. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the ""assessing risk of bias in prevalence studies"" tool. The heterogeneity was assessed using Cochrane Q and I2 heterogeneity statistics. RESULTS: A total of 13 articles have been included in this meta-analysis with a sample size of 3056. The pooled prevalence of ED patients who experienced worsening of ED symptoms was 57% (95%CI: 36%-76%), anxiety was 64% (95%CI: 39%-78%), and depression was 55% (95%CI: 12%-87%) during the pandemic.

An FMRI meta-analysis of interoception in eating disorders.,Datta N; Hughes A; Modafferi M; Klabunde M,"Eating Disorders (EDs) are associated with disturbed interoception - the sense of the internal condition of the body. Disturbances in interoception across senses have not yet been comprehensively examined in EDs. To do so, we employed an innovative Bayesian author-topic model approach to fMRI meta-analyses that pools together neural deficits across interoceptive senses and task types in participants with and recovered from EDs. Following PRISMA guidelines, our results combine activation patterns from 1,341 initially screened studies and data from 25 manuscripts that met study criteria that compare 463 patients with EDs (current or recovered) to 450 healthy control participants (HC). Altered brain activity was found within vision/sensory processing (precuneus), taste/self-referential processing (claustrum/posterior insula) and reward/set-shifting (global pallidus, medial frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate, precentral gyrus and parietal lobe) components in EDs compared to HC. Our results reveal separate components for bottom-up exteroceptive and interoceptive processing centering around the precuneus and claustrum/insula and also reward processing/set-shifting deficits. Thus, bottom-up sensory and reward processing are key deficits in EDs during ill and recovered states.",2025,Jan,Neuroimage,305,,120933,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2024.120933,39622461,#342,Datta 2025,,Anorexia; Bulimia; Neuroimaging,

The therapeutic potential of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on it, by targeting craving in particular, has been explored with heterogenous results. This meta-analysis uses updated evidence to assess overall rTMS efficacy on craving, differential effects between addiction types clustered into three groups (depressant (alcohol, cannabis, opiate), stimulant (nicotine, cocaine, methamphetamine), and behavioral addiction (gambling, eating disorder)), and stimulation settings. Studies on substance use, gambling, and eating disorders are included, with unrestricted stimulation settings, by searching the PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and Cochrane databases up to 30 April 2020. A total of 34 eligible studies (42 units of analysis) were identified. Because of highly significant heterogeneity in primary results, a sensitivity analysis was performed on a remaining sample of 26 studies (30 units of analysis). Analyses performed using random effects model revealed a small effect size favoring active rTMS over shamTMS stimulation in the reduction in craving. We found a significant difference between addiction types, with a persistent small effect only for stimulant and behavioral groups. In these groups we found no difference between the different combinations of target and frequency of stimulation, but a significant correlation between number of sessions and craving reduction. In conclusion, efficacy of rTMS on craving in stimulant and behavioral addiction was highlighted, but recommendations on optimal stimulation settings and its clinical application await further research.",2022,Jan,J Clin Med,11,3,,,10.3390/jcm11030624,35160085,#345,Gay 2022,,ED is a sub-group analysis only; treatment - neuromodulation,
Cognitive behavior therapy for adult eating disorders in routine clinical care: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Öst LG; Brattmyr M; Finnes A; Ghaderi A; Havnen A; Hedman-Lagerlöf M; Parling T; Welch E; Wergeland GJ,"OBJECTIVE: Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is a recommended treatment for eating disorders (ED) in adults given its evidence, mainly based on efficacy studies. However, little is known about how CBT works in routine clinical care. The goal of the present meta-analysis is to investigate how CBT works for various ED when carried out in routine clinical settings. METHOD: Ovid MEDLINE, Embase OVID, and PsycINFO were systematically searched for articles published until June 2023. The outcome of CBT, methodological quality, risk of bias (RoB), and moderators of treatment outcome were examined and benchmarked by meta-analytically comparing with efficacy studies for ED. Fifty studies comprising 4299 participants who received CBT were included. RESULTS: Large within-group effect sizes (ES) were obtained for ED-psychopathology at post-treatment (1.12), and follow-up (1.22), on average 9.9 months post-treatment. Attrition rate was 25.5% and RoB was considerable in the majority of studies. The benchmarking analysis showed that effectiveness studies had very similar ESs as efficacy studies (1.20 at post-treatment and 1.28 at follow-up). CONCLUSION: CBT for ED is an effective treatment when delivered in routine clinical care, with ESs comparable to those found in efficacy studies. However, the evidence needs to be interpreted with caution due to the RoB in a high proportion of studies. PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE: Eating disorders are common in the population and often lead to multiple negative consequences. CBT has been found effective for ED and is recommended in clinical guidelines. Since these recommendations are primarily based on university studies we wanted to investigate how CBT performs in routine clinical care. Our meta-analysis found that CBT worked as well in routine care as in university setting studies.",2024,Feb,Int J Eat Disord,57,2,249-264,,10.1002/eat.24104,38098336,#347,Öst 2024,,Psychological treatment,
Is Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (RTMS) a Promising Therapeutic Intervention for Eating Disorders and Obesity? Clinical Considerations Based on a Meta-Analytic Review.,Cavicchioli M; Sarzetto A; Erzegovesi S; Ogliari A,"OBJECTIVE: Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) has been introduced to treat eating disorders (EDs), especially Anorexia, Bulimia Nervosa (AN and BN) and other EDs not otherwise specified (NOS). Provisional rTMS single-case studies and clinical trials have been carried out for the treatment of binge eating disorder (BED) and obesity. However, it is still unclear whether and to what extent rTMS might be considered an effective intervention for these conditions. METHOD: This meta-analysis includes 15 independent studies examining the clinical effects of rTMS among different EDs and obesity (N = 402 patients). Several primary and secondary treatment outcomes have been considered. Cohen's d was used as an effect size measure. The analyses estimate heterogeneity across findings, sources of variability and publication bias together with an assessment of the quality of the studies. RESULTS: The analyses show that rTMS induced large improvements in body mass index (BMI) among obese individuals. Null clinical effects have been detected for primary outcomes (i.e., BMI, binge eating and compensatory behaviors; urge to binge and to eat; severity of EDs symptoms) among individuals with AN, BN and other EDs-NOS. rTMS shows moderate therapeutic effects on the affective functioning (i.e., negative affectivity, depressive and anxious symptoms) of individuals with EDs. rTMS should be considered a promising intervention for the treatment of obesity. CONCLUSIONS: This evidence might provisionally support the hypothesis on the implementation of rTMS for BED. Furthermore, rTMS could be included as an ancillary intervention for the other EDs, especially considering secondary treatment outcomes. Future controlled trials are needed to clarify the clinical effects of rTMS for EDs.",2022,Oct,Clin Neuropsychiatry,19,5,314-327,,10.36131/cnfioritieditore20220507,36340277,#349,Cavicchioli 2022,,Anorexia; Bulimia; treatment - neuromodulation,
A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis: Child and Adolescent Healthcare Utilization for Eating Disorders During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,Madigan S; Vaillancourt T; Dimitropoulos G; Premji S; Kahlert SM; Zumwalt K; Korczak DJ; von Ranson KM; Pador P; Ganshorn H; Neville RD,"OBJECTIVE: To conduct a meta-analysis documenting healthcare service utilization rates for pediatric (age <19 years) eating disorders during compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science Core Collection were searched for studies published up to May 19, 2023. Studies with pediatric visits to primary care, inpatient, outpatient, and emergency department for eating disorders before and during the pandemic were included. This preregistered review (PROSPERO CRD42023413392) was reported using PRISMA guidelines. Data were analyzed with random-effects meta-analyses. RESULTS: A total of 52 studies reporting >148,000 child and adolescent eating disorder-related visits to >300 health settings across 15 countries were included (mean age, 12.7 years; SD = 4.1 years; 87% girls). There was strong evidence of an increase in healthcare use for eating disorders during the pandemic (rate ratio [RR] = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.38-1.71). Moderator analysis revealed larger rate increases among girls (RR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.28-1.71) compared to boys (RR = 1.24, 95% CI = 1.06-1.45) and for adolescents (age ≥12 to 19 years) (RR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.29-1.81) compared to children (RR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.53-1.43). Moderator analysis demonstrated strong evidence of increased use of emergency department (RR = 1.70, 95% CI = 1.48-1.97), inpatient (RR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.33-1.84), and outpatient (RR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.35-1.95) services, as well as strong evidence of increased rates of anorexia nervosa (RR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.24-1.75). CONCLUSION: Healthcare use for pediatric eating disorders increased substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among girls and adolescents. It is important to continue to monitor whether changes in healthcare use associated with acute pediatric mental distress are sustained beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: In this study, the authors analyzed data from 52 studies from 15 countries and found a significant increase in healthcare utilization for eating disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study findings suggest a larger rate increase among adolescents as compared to children, in girls versus boys, and for anorexia nervosa in particular. Results also indicate increased use of emergency department, inpatient and outpatient services for eating disorders during the pandemic.

C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in people with eating disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,Xu C; Mutwalli H; Haslam R; Keeler JL; Treasure J; Himmerich H,"Studies suggest that there is a relationship between inflammatory diseases, inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and psychiatric disorders. In eating disorders, cross-sectional studies have recently examined peripheral CRP levels in blood serum and plasma, which allow a comprehensive meta-analysis. This systematic review and meta-analysis examined studies from three databases, measuring CRP levels in people with eating disorders, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total n = 14 publications were included into the systematic review. Of these, n = 13 cross-sectional papers with N = 700 participants were meta-analysed, n = 11 in anorexia nervosa (AN) and n = 2 in binge eating disorder (BED). One study of the total n = 14 was narratively summarised because it was not suitable for inclusion into the meta-analysis. In the cross-sectional analyses, CRP levels were significantly lower in people with AN compared to health controls (HCs), but CRP level were higher in people with BED compared to HCs. Patients with AN appear to have lower CRP levels compared to healthy controls. This could be a result of malnutrition or specific nutritional deficiencies. Due to the reduced CRP levels in AN, patients might be at risk for bacterial infections or developing autoimmune diseases, and clinicians might fail to notice an inflammatory process or an infection. In contrast, patients with BED were found to have higher CRP level than healthy controls which might be a consequence of an inflammatory response triggered by overeating, disordered eating patterns and the consumption of low-quality food during binges.",2025,Jan,J Psychiatr Res,181,,653-662,,10.1016/j.jpsychires.2024.12.039,39742796,#351,Xu 2025,,Anorexia; Binge-eating disorder; medical aspects of ED,

Most disorders displayed elevated error rates, with schizophrenia showing the greatest impairments, followed by autism spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Small to medium impairments were also found in eating disorders, major depressive disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and substance use disorder. Results were robust against corrections for publication bias and largely unaffected by confounding variables. Prolonged latencies were observed in schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bipolar disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder, with smaller and less robust effect sizes.

This study aimed to examine PALs and sedentary time (ST) in patients with AN. METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, 16 studies met inclusion criteria (PICO strategy). Sensitivity and subgroup analyses by age and treatment phase were performed. RESULTS: Patients' mean age ranged from 12.6 to 36.2 years. Pooled mean ST was high (617.49 min/day). Light physical activity (LPA), moderate physical activity (MPA) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were higher in adult studies, while vigorous physical activity (VPA) was higher in adolescents. Steps were reported only in adult samples. CONCLUSION: This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis assessing objectively measured PALs in AN patients.

The global prevalence of anemia in patients with anorexia nervosa: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Salari N; Razavizadeh S; Abdolmaleki A; Heidarian P; Rahimi A; Shohaimi S; Mohammadi M,"BACKGROUND: Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a mental disorder characterized by severe loss of appetite and low nutrient intake. Along with many complications, the anorexia nervosa eventually disrupts hematogenesis and the occurrence of anemia. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the global prevalence of anemia in anorexia nervosa patient. METHODS: Systematic searching was applied (by August 10, 2024) in databases of PubMed, Scopus, WoS, ScienceDirect, Embase, and the Google Scholar search engine. Selected investigations were imported to the EndNote Citation Management Software and duplicate papers were merged. Following consideration of inclusion and exclusion criteria (during primary and secondary screening) relevant papers were selected and underwent validation. Finally, eligible papers were selected for data extraction and meta-analysis (CMA v.2). The I2 index was used for heterogeneity assessment, and the Random Effect Model was used for meta-analysis. The results were categorized based on hematocrit and hemoglobin levels, and study type, and meta-regression was also applied for sample size and year of paper publication. RESULTS: In the review of 9 eligible studies, the global prevalence of anemia in anorexia nervosa patient was found to be 44.8% (95%CI:25.7-65.7). Also, this value was detected in 48% (95%CI:19.9-77.4) and 43.4% (95%CI:18.6-72) based on hematocrit and hemoglobin levels, respectively.

"Clinical binge eating, but not uncontrolled eating, is associated with differences in executive functions: Evidence from meta-analytic findings.",Prunell-Castañé A; Jurado MÁ; García-García I,"INTRODUCTION: Binge eating disorder (BED) is a common psychiatric diagnosis characterized by the presence of episodes of loss of control over food consumption. Understanding the neurocognitive factors associated with binge eating pathology might help to design clinical strategies aimed at preventing or treating BED. However, results in the field are notably heterogeneous. In the current study, we aimed to establish whether binge eating behaviors (both at a clinical and at a non-clinical level) are associated with executive functions. METHODS: We performed a pre-registered meta-analysis to examine the link between executive functions, BED, and uncontrolled eating, a psychobiological construct closely associated with binge eating behaviors. Articles were searched on PubMed and the main exclusion criteria were lack of information about participants' age or sex distribution or adiposity measurements, studies performed in older populations (age > 65 years old) or studies including participants with purging symptoms. RESULTS: Relative to healthy controls, patients with BED showed lower performance in executive functions, with a small effect size. At the same time, uncontrolled eating patterns were not associated with differences in executive functions. Neither age nor body mass index (BMI) influenced these results. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that there is no association between performance in executive functions and variations along the non-clinical spectrum of binge eating behaviors. Small deficits in executive functions, however, seem to appear in individuals showing severe binge eating symptoms, that is, individuals meeting diagnostic criteria for BED. We speculate that the close links between BED and emotional distress could partly explain these results.",2021,Jun,Addict Behav Rep,13,,100337,,10.1016/j.abrep.2020.100337,33506087,#361,Prunell-Castañé 2021,,Binge-eating disorder; Neurocognition,

Given the appetite-suppressing effects of tobacco, its use may be linked to weight control behaviors among individuals with eating disorders. This study aims to review the prevalence of current smoking among individuals diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa (AN), Bulimia Nervosa (BN), or Binge Eating Disorder (BED). METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across international scientific databases to identify eligible studies. Smoking prevalence rates were extracted and aggregated using random-effects models. Meta-regression and sensitivity analyses were performed to explore factors influencing prevalence rates. RESULTS: The final analysis included 30 studies, encompassing 2970 individuals with AN, 5032 with BN, and 7704 with BED. The pooled prevalence of current smoking was 23.4 % for AN, 19.3 % for BN (adjusted for publication bias), and 11.9 % for BED. Meta-regression revealed that studies with higher proportions of female participants and those using non-DSM diagnostic tools reported significantly lower smoking prevalence in BED. Additionally, higher smoking prevalence in BED was observed in North America and in studies with more recent publication years. No significant covariates were identified in the meta-regression models for AN and BN. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these findings. CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis highlights elevated current smoking rates among individuals with AN and BN compared to the general population, particularly among women. Smoking may serve as a weight control strategy in these groups, underscoring the need for integrated smoking cessation interventions within eating disorder treatment. The findings also reveal distinct regional and demographic influences on smoking behavior in BED, suggesting a nuanced approach to prevention and intervention across eating disorder subtypes.",2025,Mar,J Psychosom Res,190,,112047,,10.1016/j.jpsychores.2025.112047,39952013,#374,FloresBEV 2025,,Symptom correlates of ED,
Prevalence of Eating Disorders in Individuals With Schizophrenia Spectrum Disorder: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,Sahu SS; Khatib MN; Mm R; Kaur M; Sharma GC; Sudan P; Naidu KS; Singh R; Kushwaha B; Desai T; Shabil M; Chauhan SS; Verma L; Sidhu A; Mehta R; Satapathy P; Sah S; Gaidhane AM; Bushi G,"BACKGROUND: Eating disorders (EDs) are significant comorbidities in individuals with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSDs), yet they are often under recognized. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to synthesise existing evidence on the prevalence of EDs in SSD populations and to explore potential moderators such as geographical location and diagnostic tools. METHODS: We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, Embase and Web of Science for studies reporting the prevalence of EDs in individuals with SSDs. Subgroup analyses examined the influence of geographical location and screening tools on prevalence estimates. Sensitivity analyses and a funnel plot were used to assess the robustness of the findings and potential publication bias. RESULTS: A total of 13 studies, comprising 1135 participants, were included in the review, with 12 studies contributing to the meta-analysis using R v4.4. The pooled prevalence of EDs in individuals with SSDs was 15.65% (95% CI: 8.04-28.26), with a prediction interval ranging from 1.62% to 67.66%. Subgroup analysis by geographical location revealed substantial variability, with prevalence estimates ranging from 5.88% in Southern Europe to 28.99% in the Middle East and North Africa. Studies using questionnaire-based tools reported a higher pooled prevalence (19.25%) compared to those employing DSM-based diagnostic criteria (11.90%). Significant heterogeneity was observed across studies (I(2) = 87%). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the considerable prevalence of EDs in SSD populations, emphasising the need for early identification and integrated care. The variability in prevalence estimates suggests that geographical, cultural and methodological factors play an important role in the findings. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies, the development of standardized diagnostic tools, and the inclusion of underrepresented regions to enhance understanding and improve care for this vulnerable population.",2025,Apr,Eur Eat Disord Rev,,,,,10.1002/erv.3199,40252211,#375,Sahu 2025,Euna Lee (2025-07-30 10:10:18)(Select): sample is SSD patients; ,Prevalence rates; psychological comorbidities,
Absolute and relative outcomes of cognitive behavior therapy for eating disorders in adults: a meta-analysis.,Cuijpers P; Harrer M; Miguel C; Keshen A; Karyotaki E; Linardon J,"Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is the best examined treatment for eating disorders. However, previous meta-analyses of cognitive-behavioral therapy have not examined absolute outcomes, which are important from a clinical perspective. We updated a meta-analysis and conducted new searches in PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO and CINAHL. We included randomized trials comparing CBT with control conditions in adults with a diagnosed eating disorder. We used random effects models in all analyses. We included 36 trials with 44 comparisons between CBT and controls (2,809 participants), 22 trials on binge eating disorder (BED), 11 on bulimia nervosa (BN), and three on anorexia nervosa and mixed disorders. The overall effect of CBT compared to controls was g = 0.88 (95% CI: 0.71; 1.04), with high heterogeneity (I(2) = 74; 95% CI: 65; 81; PI: -0.06; 1.81) and no significant difference between BED and BN. Effects were smaller studies with low risk of bias. The absolute abstinence rate was 0.36 (95% CI: 0.31; 0.43) for CBT and 0.10 (95% CI: 0.08; 0.12) in controls.

Cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) for outpatients with anorexia nervosa: a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical effectiveness.,Duggan HC; Hardy G; Waller G,"Anorexia nervosa is commonly treated using outpatient cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT), but its effectiveness needs to be established. This systematic review and meta-analysis (PROSPERO CRD42023484924) assessed outpatient CBT's effectiveness for anorexia nervosa and explored potential moderators (pre-treatment Body Mass Index (BMI), age, illness duration, protocol duration of therapy, dropout). Searches (SCOPUS, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, grey literature) identified 26 studies reporting pre- to post-treatment outcomes for at least one primary measure (weight, eating disorder symptoms). Studies were medium to high quality. Secondary outcome data (depression, anxiety, quality of life) were also extracted. Meta-analyses (26 studies) found medium to large post-treatment effect sizes for weight (g = 0.87; 95% CI 0.67-1.08) and eating disorder symptoms (g = -0.74; 95% CI -0.93 - -0.54), with change starting early and increasing to follow-up. Effect sizes for secondary outcome measures were medium to large. Pre-treatment BMI moderated weight gain. This review was constrained by excluding non-English language papers and the limited number of papers reporting minimum data for inclusion. Overall, results suggest an optimistic picture for patients with anorexia nervosa treated with outpatient CBT.

Eating disorders and disordered eating symptoms in individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Lo Buglio G; Mirabella M; Muzi L; Boldrini T; Cerasti E; Bjornestad J; Fiorentino F; Polari A; Riccioli E; Rugo MA; Solmi M; Lingiardi V; Tanzilli A,"BACKGROUND: Eating disorders (EDs) are among the least studied mental disorders in individuals at clinical high risk for psychosis (CHR-P). The primary aim (a) of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to identify factors predicting ED diagnoses in CHR-P individuals. The secondary aim (b) was providing a comprehensive clinical description of individuals with both CHR-P and EDs/ED-related symptoms. METHODS: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020-compliant systematic review and meta-analysis, searching PubMed/(EBSCO)PsycINFO/Web of Science for studies published between 01/01/2018 and 30/05/2023, including individuals with CHR-P and EDs/ED symptoms (PROSPERO CRD42023488792). Quality assessment was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). We performed a meta-regression model on the proportion of EDs in CHR-P individuals (primary aim) and conducted a narrative synthesis (secondary aim). RESULTS: We included 26 articles, reporting on 2,060 and 589 subjects for study aim (a) and (b), respectively (mean NOS score = 6.38). The prevalence of EDs in CHR-P individuals was 0.05 (95% CI 0.3-0.8). No factor had a significant effect on the proportion of EDs in CHR-P individuals. This result is limited by the inability to include ED-related symptoms and antipsychotic prescriptions in the meta-regression model, due to an insufficient number of studies reporting on these variables. The narrative synthesis offers a characterization of individuals with both CHR-P and ED/ED-related symptoms; however, the limited number of included studies is insufficient to support definitive conclusions.

Mental Health Impacts of Self-Help Interventions for the Treatment and Prevention of Eating Disorders. A Meta-Analysis.,Linardon J; Jarman HK; Liu C; Anderson C; McClure Z; Messer M,"OBJECTIVE: Self-help programs are recommended as a first step in the management of eating disorders. Yet, whether self-help interventions have broader mental health benefits beyond symptom and risk reduction remains unclear. As randomized controlled trials (RCTs) also assess general mental health secondary to eating disorder symptoms, we conducted a meta-analysis to investigate whether and to what extent pure self-help interventions for eating disorders produce improvements in these secondary outcomes. METHOD: Twenty-seven RCTs of pure self-help interventions for the prevention or treatment of eating disorders were included. Mean age ranged from 16 to 46 years. Most self-help interventions were based on cognitive-behavioral therapy. Most interventions were delivered via digital means (Internet, apps, etc.). Random effects meta-analyses were conducted on six outcomes: depression, anxiety, general distress, quality of life, self-esteem, and psychosocial impairment. Analyses were stratified based on pre-selected (at risk/symptomatic) and clinical samples. RESULTS: For pre-selected samples (k = 18), significant pooled effects favoring self-help over controls were observed for depression (g = 0.24), anxiety (g = 0.23), distress (g = 0.23) and self-esteem (g = 0.18). Effects remained robust when adjusting for risk of bias. Non-significant effects were observed for quality of life and impairment. Crucially, > 80% of trials on pre-selected samples delivered a waitlist control. For clinical samples (k = 9), significant pooled effects favoring self-help were found for distress (g = 0.39), impairment (g = 0.39), and quality of life (g = 0.29), although these results should be interpreted with caution as the number of studies was low.

"Internet-based cognitive behaviour therapy for the prevention, treatment and relapse prevention of eating disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis.",Hamid N,"Eating disorders (EDs) are undertreated worldwide. In the UK the lag between recognition of symptoms and treatment ranges from about 15 months to in excess of 2 years. Internet-based cognitive behaviour therapy (ICBT) could be a viable alternative to face-to-face cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) that avoids the negative impacts of delayed interventions. Based on evidence from randomised controlled trials (RCTs), this systematic review investigated the efficacy of minimally guided self-help ICBT, without face-to-face therapy, for the prevention, treatment and relapse prevention of all types of EDs in adults. The electronic databases MEDLINE, PsychINFO, CENTRAL, Scopus, and Web of Science were searched between 1991 and 2021. Inclusion criteria specified RCTs with ICBT versus inactive comparison groups. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool-2 was used for quality assessments. Qualitative synthesis and meta-analyses were conducted. Findings typically showed medium significant beneficial effect sizes for prevention studies ranging from (-0.31 [95% CI: -0.57, -0.06] to -0.47 [95% CI: -0.82, -0.11]) and generally large effect sizes for the treatment studies ranging from (-0.30 [95% CI: -0.57, -0.03] to -1.11 [95% CI: -1.47, -0.75]). Relapse prevention studies yielded mainly small non-significant beneficial effects with significant effect sizes of (-0.29 [95% CI: -0.56, -0.03] and -0.43 [95% CI: -0.70, -0.16]). Only the treatment studies reached clinical significance and cognitive symptoms improved more than behavioural symptoms. ICBT appears to be efficacious for the prevention, treatment and relapse prevention of eating disorders with treatment interventions being the most beneficial. However, the evidence base is very small, particularly for treatment and relapse prevention, indicating the need for more high-quality RCTs.",2024,Feb,Psych J,13,1,May-18,,10.1002/pchj.715,38105569,#396,Hamid 2024,,Prevention; Treatment; digital/tech,
The Lifetime Prevalence of Non-Suicidal Self-Injury in Children and Adolescents With Eating Disorders-A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,Meier M; Jansen K; Vertgewall H; Claes L,"OBJECTIVE: Eating disorders (EDs) and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) are both phenomena with onset in adolescence. Their co-occurrence is associated with higher symptom severity and an elevated risk of suicide. In this meta-analysis, we examine the lifetime prevalence of NSSI in youth with EDs. METHODS: We searched PsycInfo, PubMed and previously published systematic reviews for studies reporting on lifetime NSSI prevalence among children and adolescents (19 years or younger) with an ED (anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating or other specified feeding and EDs) published until June 2024. A generalized linear mixed model meta-analysis was performed to estimate the pooled prevalence. Meta-regressions and multivariate meta-analyses were conducted to estimate separate prevalence rates based on ED diagnosis and care frame (e.g., inpatient vs. outpatient), respectively. RESULTS: Fifteen studies comprising 3311 children and adolescents were included. Pooled lifetime NSSI prevalence across all ED diagnoses was 34.2% [CI: 27.5%-41.7%]. Heterogeneity was large (I(2) = 93.8%). Lifetime NSSI prevalence rates were significantly higher for participants with bulimia nervosa (53.6%) and those with anorexia nervosa binge-eating/purging type (51.9%) than for participants with anorexia nervosa restrictive type (15.8%). DISCUSSION: The small number of studies and the large heterogeneity limit the conclusiveness of this meta-analysis. Results suggest an even higher prevalence of lifetime NSSI in adolescents with an ED than in adults with an ED. The results support previous findings indicating higher prevalence rates of NSSI for EDs associated with binge eating and purging behaviours than for restrictive EDs.",2025,May,Eur Eat Disord Rev,33,3,511-524,,10.1002/erv.3158,39614701,#397,Meier 2025,,Prevalence rates,
Self-Guided Psychological Interventions for the Treatment and Prevention of Eating Disorders: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,Linardon J; Liu C; McClure Z; Jarman HK; Messer M; Anderson C; Fuller-Tyszkiewicz M,"BACKGROUND: Self-guided interventions may broaden the dissemination of evidence-based prevention and treatment protocols for eating disorders. We conducted a meta-analysis comparing self-guided prevention and treatment approaches for eating disorders to (1) control groups and (2) professionally guided self-help programs. METHODS: Forty-six trials were included. Interventions ranged from web, to app, to CD-ROM to book-based programs. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted on numerous symptom and risk outcomes. RESULTS: Only four trials recruited an unselected sample, with self-guided programs reducing shape/weight concerns over control groups (g = 0.18). Among high risk/symptomatic samples (k = 25), self-guided interventions reduced several behavioural and cognitive symptoms (gs = 0.31-0.50) over control groups, with effects being robust when adjusting for higher risk of bias and small sample trials. Among clinical samples (k = 17), evidence for the effectiveness of self-guided interventions over control groups on symptom measures was only found for binge-eating disorder, as too few studies sampled other diagnostic subtypes. Among 10 trials that compared guided to unguided self-help, we observed a significant effect in symptom reduction in favour of guided self-help (g = -0.26). Dropout did not differ between guided and unguided self-help (OR = 0.97).

Effects of cognitive-behavioral and psychodynamic-interpersonal treatments for eating disorders: a meta-analytic inquiry into the role of patient characteristics and change in eating disorder-specific and general psychopathology in remission.,Moberg LT; Solvang B; Sæle RG; Myrvang AD,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and psychodynamic-interpersonal therapies (PIT) are two widely used and conceptually different outpatient treatments for eating disorders (EDs). To better understand how these treatments works, for whom, and under what circumstances, there is a need for knowledge about how outcomes are affected by diagnosis, comorbidity, changes in psychopathology, and study design. METHOD: Reports on the effects of CBT and PIT for eating disorders were searched. Rates of remission and changes in ED specific- and general psychopathology were computed. Regression models were made to predict event rates by changes in specific- and general psychopathology, as well as ED diagnosis and study design. RESULTS: The remission rate of CBT for binge eating disorder was 50%, significantly higher than the effect for other diagnostic groups (anorexia = 33%, bulimia: 28%, mixed samples 30%). The number of studies found for PIT was limited. All effect sizes differed from zero (binge eating disorder = 27%, anorexia = 24%, bulimia = 18%, mixed samples = 15%), but the precision of the estimates was low, with some lower-bound confidence intervals close to zero. For CBT, change in ED specific psychopathology predicted remission only when controlling for ED diagnosis, while change in general psychopathology did not predict remission at all. The predictive value of change in psychopathology for PIT, and the potential impact of comorbid personality disorders could not be analyzed due to a lack of studies. There was no difference in effects between randomized controlled trials and observational studies. CONCLUSIONS: CBT showed consistent remission rates for all EDs but left a substantial number of patients not in remission. Extant evidence suggest that PIT is not consistently effective in achieving remission for patients with EDs, although this finding is uncertain due to a small number of eligible studies. A group of patients with eating disorders may, however, require therapy aimed at strengthening deficits in self functions not easily ameliorable by cognitive behavioral techniques alone. Further research should be aimed at identifying treatment interventions that helps patients change behavior, while strengthening self-functions to substitute eating-disordered behavior in the long-term.",2021,Jun,J Eat Disord,9,1,74,,10.1186/s40337-021-00430-8,34174942,#401,Moberg 2021,,Psychological treatment,
The Unmet Treatment Need for Eating Disorders: What Has Changed in More Than 10 Years? An Updated Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,Ali K; Radunz M; McLean SA; O'Shea A; Mavrangelos T; Fassnacht DB; Hart L,"OBJECTIVE: A minority of individuals with eating disorders seek help from health professionals qualified to provide eating disorder care. This review assessed the proportion of individuals with eating disorders who had sought help or received treatment, as an update to an earlier review conducted more than a decade ago. METHOD: Three databases were searched for studies that: (1) included a community sample of help-seekers and non-help seekers, (2) used a standardized eating disorder screening instrument, and (3) assessed the percentage of participants who had sought help specifically for eating disorder concerns. RESULTS: Of 972 articles, 21 studies met inclusion criteria, representing 37,423 participants. The pooled proportion reporting help-seeking from any source (e.g., helpline, support groups, chat rooms as well as health professionals) was 30% and the pooled proportion reporting formal treatment seeking from health professionals (e.g., psychologist) specifically for eating disorder concerns was 32%. However, there was evidence of publication bias across studies. DISCUSSION: These rates suggest little to no improvement in the unmet need for treatment since the last review with studies continuing to focus on white adult women. Help-seeking rates among other populations remain unclear and there is an urgent need to understand reasons for overall low help-seeking rates. Clear definitions and measures of help-seeking with appropriate distinctions between sources of help are needed to improve our understanding of help-seeking pathways and identify solutions to facilitate help-seeking.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the incremental effects of app-based interventions when used as adjunct to mental health interventions. METHODS: We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases on September 15th, 2023, for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on mental health interventions with an adjunct app-based intervention compared to the same intervention-only arm for adults with mental disorders or respective clinically relevant symptomatology. We conducted meta-analyses on symptoms of different mental disorders at postintervention. PROSPERO, CRD42018098545. RESULTS: We identified 46 RCTs (4869 participants). Thirty-two adjunctive app-based interventions passively or actively monitored symptoms and behaviour, and in 13 interventions, the monitored data were sent to a therapist. We found additive effects on symptoms of depression (g = 0.17; 95 % CI 0.02 to 0.33; k = 7 comparisons), anxiety (g = 0.80; 95 % CI 0.06 to 1.54; k = 3), mania (g = 0.2; 95 % CI 0.02 to 0.38; k = 4), smoking cessation (g = 0.43; 95 % CI 0.29 to 0.58; k = 10), and alcohol use (g = 0.23; 95 % CI 0.08 to 0.39; k = 7). No significant effects were found on symptoms of depression within a bipolar disorder (g = -0.07; 95 % CI -0.37 to 0.23, k = 4) and eating disorders (g = -0.02; 95 % CI -0.44 to 0.4, k = 3). Studies on depression, mania, smoking, and alcohol use had a low heterogeneity between the trials. For other mental disorders, only single studies were identified. Only ten studies had a low risk of bias, and 25 studies reported insufficient statistical power. DISCUSSION: App-based interventions may be used to enhance mental health interventions to further reduce symptoms of depression, anxiety, mania, smoking, and alcohol use.

The aim of this systematic review is to evaluate oral health parameters in anorexic patients compared to healthy individuals. Furthermore, potential clinical implications for orthodontic treatment are discussed from an orthodontic perspective. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for case-control and controlled clinical trial studies on dentofacial manifestations in anorexic patients up to 2/2024. Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment was done independently by two authors. Random-effects meta-analyses of mean differences (MDs) or relative risks (RRs) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were conducted, followed by sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: Eleven out of 573 initially identified studies were included. They involved oral health analyses of general anorexic patients ≥ 12 years (mean age 18.4). The meta-analysis showed that anorexia nervosa was associated with a significantly increased caries experience (DMFT), plaque accumulation and gingival inflammation (BOP). PH and salivary flow rate were significantly altered in patients with anorexia nervosa, although no significant relationship between α-amylase levels and anorexia nervosa was demonstrated. CONCLUSIONS: These data enabled us to formulate modalities for anorexia-specific orthodontic treatments.

There is limited knowledge about how these treatments work in routine clinical care. The goal of the present meta-analysis is to investigate the effectiveness of family therapy and CBT for various EDs in children and adolescents when carried out in routine clinical care. Ovid MEDLINE, Embase OVID, and PsycINFO were searched for articles published until December 2023. The outcome of family therapy and CBT, methodological quality, risk of bias, and moderators of treatment outcome were examined and benchmarked by meta-analytically comparing with ED efficacy studies. Forty-four effectiveness studies comprising 3251 family therapy or CBT patients were included. Large to very large within-group effect sizes (ES) were found for ED-psychopathology (0.80) and weight measures for AN (1.64) at post treatment. The attrition rate was 15%. Risk of bias was considerable. Moderate to large ES were found for family therapy and CBT, respectively. The benchmarking analysis showed that effectiveness studies had comparable ESs to efficacy studies (0.80 and 0.84 for the ED-psychopathology at post treatment).

Common and distinct neural patterns of gray matter alterations in adults with anorexia nervosa and obsessive-compulsive disorder.,Wan X; Zhang P; Jiang Y; Liu G; Ma L; Zhang J,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) often share multiple similar symptoms and are highly comorbid; however, the common and distinct brain neuroanatomy of these two diseases are unclear. The current study attempted to identify the overlapping and different gray matter volume (GMV) between AN and OCD. We conducted a voxel-wise meta-analysis of GMV using the latest Seed-based d Mapping with Permutation of Subject Images Toolbox (SDM-PSI) software. Compared to healthy controls, patients with AN showed reduced GMV in supplementary motor areas, median cingulate cortices, the left cerebellum, right Rolandic operculum (RO), right insula, right superior temporal gyrus (STG), and right precuneus, while OCD patients were characterized by low GMV in the right insula, STG, RO, and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). The conjunctional analysis indicated that these two disorders have overlapping structural abnormalities in the right insula, STG, RO and IFG. No distinct GMV alteration was found. These common structural brain abnormalities may underlie the neuropathology of the similar neuropsychological features and highly comorbid manifestations of AN and OCD.",2025,Jan,Eur Arch Psychiatry Clin Neurosci,,,,,10.1007/s00406-024-01946-1,39875730,#433,Wan 2025,,,
The effect of eHealth-based guided self help interventions for binge eating disorder : a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,Tuncer GZ; Tuncer M,"With rapid technological advancements, eHealth-based guided self-help interventions have become accessible, flexible, cost-effective, and stigma-reducing treatment options for binge eating disorder (BED). This meta-analysis evaluated the effectiveness of these interventions in individuals diagnosed with BED or showing BED symptoms, based on eight randomized controlled trials with 1,575 participants. Intervention length varied between a single session to four months. Six studies focused solely on web-based guided self-help interventions, one study implemented a hybrid approach combining face-to-face and online components, and another study employed two distinct online guided self-help methods. The interventions included psychoeducational modules, therapist feedback, online behavior monitoring, and self-assessments. eHealth-based guided self-help significantly reduced binge eating psychopathology (SMD: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.20-0.86) and objective binge eating (OBE) days (SMD: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.12-0.85) compared to controls.

Psychiatric disorders in individuals born very preterm / very low-birth weight: An individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis.,Anderson PJ; de Miranda DM; Albuquerque MR; Indredavik MS; Evensen KAI; Van Lieshout R; Saigal S; Taylor HG; Raikkonen K; Kajantie E; Marlow N; Johnson S; Woodward LJ; Austin N; Nosarti C; Jaekel J; Wolke D; Cheong JL; Burnett A; Treyvaud K; Lee KJ; Doyle LW,"BACKGROUND: Data on psychiatric disorders in survivors born very preterm (VP; <32 weeks) or very low birthweight (VLBW; <1500 g) are sparse. We compared rates of psychiatric diagnoses between VP/VLBW and term-born, normal birthweight (term/NBW) control participants. METHODS: This individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis pooled data from eligible groups in the Adults born Preterm International Collaboration (APIC). Inclusion criteria included: 1) VP/VLBW group (birth weight <1500 g and/or gestational age <32 weeks), 2) normal birth weight/term-born control group (birth weight >2499 g and/or gestational age ≥37 weeks), and 3) structured measure of psychiatric diagnoses using DSM or ICD criteria. Diagnoses of interest were Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), Anxiety Disorder, Mood Disorder, Disruptive Behaviour Disorder (DBD), Eating Disorder, and Psychotic Disorder. A systematic search for eligible studies was conducted (PROSPERO Registration Number 47555). FINDINGS: Data were obtained from 10 studies (1385 VP/VLBW participants, 1780 controls), using a range of instruments and approaches to assigning diagnoses. Those born VP/VLBW had ten times higher odds of meeting criteria for ASD (odds ratio [OR] 10·6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2·50, 44·7), five times higher odds of meeting criteria for ADHD (OR 5·42, 95% CI 3·10, 9·46), twice the odds of meeting criteria for Anxiety Disorder (OR 1·91, 95% CI 1·36, 2·69), and 1·5 times the odds of meeting criteria for Mood Disorder (OR 1·51, 95% CI 1·08, 2·12) than controls. This pattern of findings was consistent within age (<18 years vs. ≥18 years) and sex subgroups. INTERPRETATION: Our data suggests that individuals born VP/VLBW might have higher odds of meeting criteria for certain psychiatric disorders through childhood and into adulthood than term/NBW controls. Further research is needed to corroborate our results and identify factors associated with psychiatric disorders in individuals born VP/VLBW.

The Impact of Age on Gray Matter Volume Reduction in Anorexia Nervosa: A Systematic Review.,Gao H; Chen S; Wang L; Shih PB,"OBJECTIVE: This study examines the relationship between gray matter (GM) volume reduction and age in individuals with Anorexia Nervosa (AN). Specifically, it investigates whether the magnitude and direction of GM volume differences between AN and healthy controls remain consistent across a range of age groups. Additionally, we reviewed regional GM alterations reported in the literature to characterize unique regional brain profiles observed in AN. By synthesizing neuroimaging studies and mean-age stratified analysis, this work provides insights into the possible impact aging can have on GM reduction in patients with AN. METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted using MRI-based neuroimaging studies assessing GM volume in AN patients and controls. A primary meta-analysis was run for all feasible studies combined, followed by a stratified analysis approach examining ""younger mean-age"" studies and ""older mean-age"" studies separately. Random effects models were used for the meta-analysis. Meta-regression was used to determine the influence of age on GM volume differences and was controlled for the body mass index to minimize the confounding effect recovery status has on the GM differences between groups. Regional GM alterations were reviewed and discussed. RESULTS: 44 studies, including 1391 individuals with AN and 1566 healthy controls, were included in the primary meta-analysis. No substantial heterogeneity was found across studies. Compared to their respective control groups, the younger-age studies, defined by studies with AN subject of mean age less than 18, exhibited greater significant GM volume loss (-5.39, 95% CI: -7.76 to -3.01, p<0.05) compared to older-age studies (-3.09, 95% CI: -4.16 to -2.03, p<0.05). Meta-regression subgroup results suggest that having older age in AN subjects is linked to less severe GM reduction relative controls. Our review of the regional GM literature reveals that alterations in the hippocampus, amygdala, and precuneus of the medial parietal lobe were more frequently reported than other brain regions in AN. In these regions, we also noticed that younger individuals with AN had more consistent volume reductions across studies, whereas studies with older AN showed greater variability. CONCLUSION: Grey matter volume loss in AN is more pronounced in younger patients even after controlling for the effect of the recovery status. Having older age appears to contribute to less deficit in brain volume loss in AN, suggesting a protective mechanism underlying GM alteration in older AN patients. These findings reinforce the need for early intervention and prolonged recovery support and emphasize the need to develop lifespan-specific disorder management approaches. Future research should explore long-term GM recovery trajectories and the aging effect on GM alteration for older patients to refine strategies for neuroprotection in AN.",2025,Mar,medRxiv,,,,,10.1101/2025.03.03.25322748,40093206,#454,Gao 2025,,Anorexia; Neuroimaging,
Prevalence of alcohol use and smoking in eating disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Amiri, S; Yaghoobi, A; Khan, MAB","Objectives

The purpose of this study was a systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence of alcohol and smoking in eating disorders.
Methods

The databases used in this study were PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. These databases were searched in English by December 2023. The sample size and event for alcohol use and smoking were extracted from each of the studies. Also, the subgroups were examined based on the types of eating disorders. The random-effects method was used to combine the results of the studies.
Results

The prevalence of alcohol use in eating disorders is equal to 27% (CI 2332%; I2_=_99.6%). The prevalence of smoking in eating disorders is equal to 31% (CI 2736%; I2_=_99.1%). The prevalence of alcohol use in anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder was 26%, 390%, and 29% respectively. The prevalence of smoking in anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder was 24%, 41%, and 35% respectively.
Conclusion

Based on the findings, it was shown that the prevalence of alcohol use and smoking in eating disorders is high. Accordingly, this issue needs to be considered by health professionals and health policy to be used in activities related to prevention and treatment.",2025,,JOURNAL OF SUBSTANCE USE,,,,WOS:001389801700001,10.1080/14659891.2024.2446933,,#473,Amiri 2025,,Prevalence rates; Symptom correlates of ED,
Scrutinizing Domains of Executive Function in Binge Eating Disorder: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Cury, MEG; Berberian, A; Scarpato, BS; Kerr-Gaffney, J; Santos, FH; Claudino, AM","Background: Cognitive deficits are implicated in theoretical explanatory models for binge eating disorder (BED). Furthermore, evidence suggest that alterations in executive function may underlie symptoms in BED. The current systematic review and meta-analysis provides an update on executive functioning in individuals with BED.

Methods: Literature searches (up to November 2019) were conducted in electronic databases combining binge eating or BED with executive functions. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement guidelines was used. Studies of any design comparing adults with BED with those without BED in executive function domains were selected. Methodological quality of studies was based on the Newcastle-Ottawa scale.

Results: Of 1,983 citations identified, 28 case-control studies met inclusion criteria for this review. Six meta-analyses that examined four domains (decision-making, cognitive flexibility, inhibitory control, and working memory) were conducted. The only meta-analysis to show a significant difference in executive functioning between BED and obese controls was working memory (SMD = 0.32, 95% IC: _0.60, _0.03; p = 0.028), with an effect size of small magnitude. Qualitative inspection of the literature indicated mixed findings for control inhibition, decision making and cognitive flexibility in individuals with BED compared to controls (obese or normal weight). In addition, people with BED showed poorer problem solving performance, but similar planning abilities to obese controls.

Conclusions: Individuals with BED were found to show worse performance on working memory tasks compared to obese individuals without the disorder. The findings did not provide definitive evidence of alterations in other aspects of executive functioning. Interest in executive functioning in people with BED is increasing but is limited by insufficient data from small studies with varied methodology. Future studies should focus on using similar tests and outcome measures, in order to enable more pertinent comparisons across studies.",2020,,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY,11,,,WOS:000530509300001,10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00288,,#508,Cury 2020,,Binge-eating disorder; Neurocognition,
A preliminary systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials of cognitive remediation therapy for anorexia nervosa,"Hagan, KE; Christensen, KA; Forbush, KT","Cognitive remediation therapy (CRT) for anorexia nervosa (AN) was developed as an adjuvant treatment to target set-shifting and central coherence inefficiencies important in AN and to ultimately improve clinical outcomes of those with AN. The primary aim of this preliminary systematic review and meta-analysis was to determine the effect of CRT for AN relative to control treatments in randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) on neuropsychological inefficiencies at end-of-treatment. Secondary aims were to assess the effect of CRT for AN on dropout, eating-disorder-related, and other psychological outcomes at end-of-treatment. Systematic review and meta-analytic procedures were conducted in accordance with PRISMA Guidelines. RCTs evaluating CRT for AN compared to a control treatment were identified via ProQuest, PsycINFO, PubMed, and SCOPUS. Seven RCTs and one quasi-RCT of CRT for AN were included. RCT quality ratings ranged from fair (n = 3) to good (n = 4). Random-effects meta-analysis was conducted using Hedge's g. Study heterogeneity was assessed using I2and publication bias was assessed with Begg's adjusted-rank correlation and the trim-and-fill method. CRT was not associated with improvement in central coherence compared to control treatments at end-of-treatment (g = 0.25, 95% CI = -0.35, 0.85, k = 3). Set-shifting outcomes were mixed due to heterogeneity of set-shifting measures across studies. CRT may prevent dropout; yet, more studies are needed to draw conclusions. CRT did not confer advantage over control treatments for eating-disorder-related and other psychological outcomes at end-of-treatment. Future RCTs of CRT for AN should use precise measures to assess constructs (particularly for set shifting), increase sample size, and implement longitudinal follow-up.

A Meta-Analysis of Dropout and Metabolic Effects of Antipsychotics in Anorexia Nervosa,"Kan, CR; Eid, L; Treasure, J; Himmerich, H","Background: Second-generation antipsychotics are often used off-label in the treatment of anorexia nervosa (AN) across the clinical spectrum. Patients with anorexia nervosa often cite concerns about metabolic effects, such as weight gain, as reasons for their reluctance to start or continue second-generation antipsychotics. Improving our understanding of the metabolic effect patients experience and reasons underlying their disinclination will enable us to build rapport and guide our clinical decisions. We therefore aimed to conduct a comprehensive review of dropouts, metabolic effects, and patient-reported outcomes associated with second-generation antipsychotic in people with AN.

Method: EMBASE, Medline, and PsycINFO were searched for all relevant studies published until 2019, and retrieved studies were assessed for eligibility as per predefined inclusion criteria. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to assess overall dropout rates.

Results: Of 983 citations retrieved, 21 studies met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review and 10 studies had appropriate data for meta-analysis. Using the random effects model, the pooled dropout rate in the intervention arm (95% confidence interval) from psychopharmacological trials was 28% (19 to 38%) in people with AN. Personal reasons or factors associated with study were commonest reason for dropout, not adverse events or metabolic effects as hypothesized.

Conclusion: Compared to personal reasons, drug-related factors such as side effects seem to play a lesser role for the discontinuation of antipsychotic treatment under trial conditions. This suggests an urgent need to consider and fully examine potential individual and patient-related factors that influence dropout rates in psychopharmacological trials and treatment compliance in clinical settings.",2020,,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY,11,,,WOS:000525655900001,10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00208,,#556,Kan 2020,,Anorexia; Pharmacotherapy,
Prevalence of Eating Disorders in Iran From Preschool to Old Age: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"Hashemi, SH; Hosseini, SH; Moosazadeh, M; Shamspour, M; Hajizadeh-Zaker, R; Hashemi, SB","Background: Eating disorders are among the deadliest psychiatric diseases that have become increasingly prevalent in different societies in recent years. Various biological, social, and psychological factors are involved in the emergence of different types of eating disorders. Several studies have been conducted by medical and non-medical researchers in Iran to estimate the prevalence of this disorder and its subcategories, which have been associated with different epidemiological methodologies and instruments and inconsistent results. 
Objectives: This study aims to statistically analyze all available findings to determine the total estimate of the prevalence of eating disorders in the general population of Iran and to investigate the reasons for the heterogenous results in previous studies.
Methods: The articles were collected by searching the following databases: SID, Magiran, Irandoc, Iran Medex, PubMed, and Google Scholar. All studies evaluating the prevalence of eating disorders in any region of Iran from 1990 to the end of 2021 were included in the study. Meanwhile, articles that were irrelevant in terms of subject or methodology were excluded. Three researchers independently extracted the data from the articles based on a pre-prepared list that included the authors name, study title, year of publication, journal name, city and study population, sample size, study instruments, and eating disorder prevalence.
Results: The estimated point prevalence of any eating disorder in Iran was 22% (95% CI, 7%-38%). The estimated lifetime prevalence of eating disorder, anorexia nervosa, and bulimia nervosa was 1% (95% CI, 1%-2%), 1% (95% CI, 0%-1%), and 1% (95% CI, 0%-1%), respectively.
Conclusions: The prevalence of eating disorders and its subcategories is much lower in Iran compared to high-income and developed countries.

Is eating disorders a risk agent for all-cause mortality: a meta-analysis,"Amiri, S; Khan, MA","The aim of this study was a systematic review and meta-analysis of the relationship between eating disorders and mortality. Based on this, eating disorders were investigated concerning all causes of mortality. Information sources including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science were used based on a systematic search. Google Scholar and Research Gate were also searched. The search in these databases started without a time limit and was done until December 2023. This search was done in English. The results extracted were pooled together based on the Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR) with a 95% confidence interval. The random effects method was used to pool studies together. An analysis was performed based on eating disorders and mortality, and the relationship between three types of eating disorders and mortality was reported as subgroups. Sixty studies were included in the meta-analysis. The obtained results showed that eating disorders have a significant relationship with the risk of mortality; SMR was 4.42 (CI 3.55-5.50; Z = 13.31; p < .001; I2 = 96.3%). Anorexia nervosa has a significant relationship with the risk of mortality, SMR was 5.31 (CI 4.15-6.79; Z = 13.30; p < .001; I2 = 93.1%).

Purpose: We aim to evaluate the association of PCOS with eating, sleeping and sexual function disorders.

Methods: A comprehensive search including MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus through 01 August 2018 was conducted for studies reporting the prevalence of any eating, sleep or sexual function disorders in patients with PCOS. Independent reviewers selected studies and extracted data. A random-effects model was utilized to generate pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for binary outcomes, and mean difference (MD) and 95% CI for continuous outcomes.

Results: We included 36 studies reporting on 349,529 patients. Compared to women without PCOS, women with PCOS were more likely to have bulimia nervosa (OR 1.37; %CI, 1.17 to 1.60), binge eating (OR 2.95; 95%CI, 1.61 to 5.42), or any eating disorder (OR 1.96; 95% CI 1.18 to 3.24); but not anorexia nervosa (OR 0.92; 95%CI, 0.78 to 1.10). Women with PCOS were more likely to have sleep disorders like hypersomnia (OR 4.39; %CI, 1.07 to 18.07) and obstructive sleep apnoea (OR 10.81; %CI, 2.39 to 48.83). Women with PCOS had lower sexual satisfaction as measured on a visual analogue scale (MD -29.67; 95% CI, -36.97 to -22.37), but no difference in Total Female Sexual Function Index (MD -0.06; 95% CI, -0.51 to 0.38).

Adipokines in anorexia nervosa: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Karageorgiou, V; Furukawa, TA; Tsigkaropoulou, E; Karavia, A; Gournellis, R; Soureti, A; Bellos, I; Douzenis, A; Michopoulos, I","

Objective: The association between adipokine dysregulation and weight loss of patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) has been long investigated, in search of a causal relationship. We sought to: a) synthesize the available evidence on potential differences between AN patients and controls with regards to adipokine measurements (namely, leptin, adiponectin, resistin, soluble leptin receptor, visfatin, vaspin and omentin), b) estimate the potential differences between constitutionally thin (CT) subjects and AN patients, and c) present the available evidence with regards to biomarker efficacy of adipokines in AN.

Methods: A structured literature search, last updated in 2/2019, was conducted in the following databases: MEDLINE, clinicaltrials.gov, PsycINFO, PSYNDEX and WHO Registry Network. The primary outcome was the standardized mean difference of each adipokine between AN patients and controls of normal BMI. Secondary outcomes included the correlation of leptin with BMI and bone mineral density among AN patients. The study protocol is published in PROSPERO (CRD42018116767).

Results: In a total of 622 screened studies, after exclusion of non-relevant articles and duplicates, 84 reports on leptin, 31 reports on adiponectin, 12 on resistin, 10 on soluble leptin receptor, 5 on visfatin, 3 on vaspin and omentin were finally included in the meta-analysis. Publication bias assessment underlined the possibility of non-significant studies being underrepresented; still, significant heterogeneity renders this statement inconclusive. Leptin [ELISA: SMD (95% CI): -3.03 (-4, -2.06)], radioimmunoassay [RIA: -3.84 (-4.71, -2.98)] and resistin [-1.67 (-2.85, -0.48)] were significantly lower in patients with AN compared with controls, whereas visfatin decrease did not reach significance (-2.03 (-4.38, 0.3). Mean adiponectin, vaspin and soluble leptin receptor levels were significantly higher. In subgroup analysis, a significantly attenuated SMD was reported in ELISA studies compared with RIA studies. Leptin was significantly lower in AN patients compared to CT subjects and BMI marginally did not appear to confound the result. In all analyses, except for the correlation of leptin with BMI in AN patients, high heterogeneity was present. Meta-regression analysis indicated a potential confounding action of controls' BMI and age on leptin SMD and between-assay differences. Publication bias assessment underlined the possibility of nonsignificant studies being underrepresented; still, further investigation did not corroborate this and significant heterogeneity renders this statement inconclusive.

Conclusion: A distinct profile of adipokine dysregulation is apparent in AN patients, following the anticipated pattern of low BMI. A precise estimation of the magnitude is hindered by heterogeneity, partly caused by varying assays and methodologies. Interestingly, while mean leptin levels are lower in AN subjects compared with constitutionally thin women, there is an overlap in individual levels between the two groups and therefore, they cannot be used to differentiate between these states.",2020,,PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY,112,,,WOS:000509615800002,10.1016/j.psyneuen.2019.104485,,#610,Karageorgiou 2020,,Anorexia; medical aspects of ED,

The utilization of a bupropionnaltrexone (NB) combination has been suggested as a potential therapeutic approach for BED. Assessing the effectiveness of NB in the treatment of BED and its accompanying obesity is the purpose of this research. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted in order to obtain any pertinent articles. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Clinical Trials were consulted against in the databases that were searched. In our final meta-analysis, we incorporated interventional or observational studies that documented the effects of NB therapy for binge eating in adults. We also examined the difference in the mean change between the NB and placebo groups, as well as the disparity in outcomes before and after treatment. Results: This study shows that the use of an NB combination is associated with a statistically significant reduction in the weight, BMI, and Binge Eating Scale (BES) of the patients compared to their weight before treatment with MD: _8.52 (95% CI: _10.01_6.94, p < 0.00001), MD: _4.95 (95%CI: _9.72_0.17, p = 0.04), and MD: _7.66 (95%CI: _14.360.96, p = 0.02), respectively. The absolute mean change was statistically significantly higher in the drug combination group compared to the placebo group.

White Matter Abnormalities in Anorexia Nervosa: Psychoradiologic Evidence From Meta-Analysis of Diffusion Tensor Imaging Studies Using Tract Based Spatial Statistics,"Zhang, SM; Wang, WN; Su, XR; Li, L; Yang, XB; Su, JK; Tan, QY; Zhao, YJ; Sun, HQ; Kemp, GJ; Gong, QY; Yue, Q","Background: Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a debilitating illness whose neural basis remains unclear. Studies using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) have demonstrated differences in white matter (WM) microarchitecture in AN, but the findings are inconclusive and controversial. Objectives: To identify the most consistent WM abnormalities among previous TBSS studies of differences in WM microarchitecture in AN. Methods: By systematically searching online databases, a total of 11 datasets were identified, including 245 patients with AN and 246 healthy controls (HC). We used Seed-based d Mapping to analyze fractional anisotropy (FA) differences between AN patients and HC, and performed meta-regression analysis to explore the effects of clinical characteristics on WM abnormalities in AN. Results: The pooled results of all AN patients showed robustly lower FA in the corpus callosum (CC) and the cingulum compared to HC. These two regions preserved significance in the sensitivity analysis as well as in all subgroup analyses. Fiber tracking showed that the WM tracts primarily involved were the body of the CC and the cingulum bundle. Meta-regression analysis revealed that the body mass index and mean age were not linearly correlated with the lower FA. Conclusions: The most consistent WM microstructural differences in AN were in the interhemispheric connections and limbic association fibers. These common ""targets"" advance our understanding of the complex neural mechanisms underlying the puzzling symptoms of AN, and may help in developing early treatment approaches.

What Are the Effects of Restrictive Eating Disorders on Growth and Puberty and Are Effects Permanent? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Neale, J; Pais, SMA; Nicholls, D; Chapman, S; Hudson, LD","

Purpose: The objective of the study was to examine (1) the effect of restrictive eating disorders (EDs) on growth and pubertal development in children and young people (CYP) and (2) potential reversibility of this with recovery and associated factors. EDs can impact growth and puberty in CYP, but reports have conflicted over effect on height and permanence of growth impairment and pubertal delay.

Methods: This is a systematic review and meta-analysis, searching PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science from May 31, 2018, to inception. We included observational studies or systematic reviews regarding growth and puberty in EDs in CYP aged <18 years or in studies reporting outcomes in adults known to have had an ED under age 18 years. Cross-sectional studies were pooled for meta-analysis for effects on height.

Results: A total of 27 studies were included. Growth and pubertal delay were commonly reported, but evidence for catch-up growth found in the majority. However, catch-up growth was not seen in all and may be suboptimal. Meta-analysis of 459 subjects (213 with anorexia nervosa and 246 controls) found no significant difference in height at baseline, with weighted mean difference -.13 cm (95% CI -2.64 to 2.38 cm; p = .9; I2 = 68.5%). Younger age and longer duration of illness are potential risks for growth delay; weight gain appears protective for catch-up growth. Findings are primarily generalisable to females, given limited data on males.

Conclusions: CYP with restrictive EDs are at risk of growth impairment and pubertal delay, though potentially reversible. Attention to growth in EDs is important, especially in the young. Weight restoration should be encouraged to avoid adverse effects and allow opportunity for catch-up.",2020,,JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT HEALTH,66,2,144-156,WOS:000507376100005,10.1016/j.jadohelath.2019.08.032,,#666,Neale 2020,Pablo del Sol Calderon (2025-07-19 06:16:05)(Select): DOI NOT FOUND; ,Longer term outcomes; Medical complications,

We also examined correlations between psychopathology and rumination, brooding, and reflection. Systematic searches of four electronic databases from July 2008 to December 2021 identified 585 abstracts that were eligible for full text review and 99 were included in the meta-analysis. Compared with healthy controls, rumination was significantly higher in major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD), and anorexia nervosa (AN). Brooding was also higher in MDD, GAD, and SAD and reflection was higher in MDD and SAD. Significant medium to large correlations were found between psychopathology and rumination for MDD, GAD, and SAD. Psychopathology was correlated with brooding and reflection in MDD and brooding in SAD. These findings indicate that total rumination is strongly associated with MDD, SAD, GAD, and AN, brooding is strongly associated with MDD, SAD and GAD, and reflection is strongly associated with MDD and SAD.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of a 10-session cognitive behavioural therapy for non-underweight eating disorders,"Keegan, E; Waller, G; Wade, TD","Treatment guidelines recommend that people with non-underweight eating disorders should receive up to 20 sessions of eating-disorder-focused cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT-ED). The present study reviewed ten studies of 10-session cognitive behavioural therapy for non-underweight patients (CBT-T).
Method

We conducted a systematic review using four electronic databases and contacted researchers in the field for unpublished data. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted to pool within-group effect sizes.
Results

From pre-treatment to post-treatment, medium to very large effect sizes were observed for eating disorder psychopathology, clinical impairment, depression, anxiety, and weekly frequencies of objective bingeing and vomiting. Furthermore, the effect of CBT-T appears to last after treatment with eating disorder psychopathology remaining below the norm for non-clinical females at follow-up. The dropout rate from CBT-T was 39%, and 65% of completers achieved a good outcome.
Conclusions

While results should be interpreted as preliminary due to a number of limitations, the present study suggests that CBT-T is a promising treatment for people with non-underweight eating disorders, which can achieve a good outcome in half the time currently recommended in treatment guidelines. The present study, therefore, provides valuable justification for future randomised controlled trials directly comparing short and long forms of CBT-ED as well as examining who does best with which version.",2022,,CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST,26,3,241-254,WOS:000811695300001,10.1080/13284207.2022.2075257,,#700,Keegan 2022,,Psychological treatment,

Studies have coined a new term, 'Diabulimia' which refers to the limitation or skipping of insulin doses, with the objective of weight control. A previous metaanalysis has found that eating disorders (ED) are significantly associated with T1DM (Mannucci, E et al. J Endocrinol Invest 2005; 417-9), while a more recent one, has shown an insignificant association between ED and T1DM on analysis of diabetes-adapted questionnaires only (Young V, et al. Diabet Med. 2013:189-198) Objectives: We aimed to re-analyze the association between ED and T1DM, whilst taking into account recently published literature and the type of questionnaire utilized. Methods: A literature search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted on 17th January 2023, using the key terms ' T1DM', 'Eating Disorders', and ' Bulimia'. Only Observational controlled studies were included. Results: T1DM was associated with increased risk of ED compared to non-diabetic individuals (RR = 2.47, 95% CI = 1.84 to 3.32, p-value < 0.00001), especially bulimia nervosa (RR = 2.80, 95% CI = 1.18 to 6.65, p-value = 0.02) and binge eating (RR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.18 to 1.98, p-value = 0.001), while no significant association was seen between T1DM and anorexia nervosa. Our sensitivity analysis has shown that increased risk of ED among T1DM persisted regardless of the questionnaire used to diagnose ED; DM-validated questionnaires (RR = 2.80, 95% CI = 1.91 to 4.12, p-value <0.00001) and generic questionnaires (RR = 2.03, 95% CI = 1.27 to 3.23, p-value = 0.003). Furthermore, the Eating Attitudes Test-26 (EAT) showed a significant increase in the dieting subscale (MD = 2.95, 95% CI = 1.84 to 4.06, p-value < 0.00001) and bulimia subscale (MD = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.12 to 1.44, p-value = 0.02) among T1DM patients. Additionally, the Bulimic Investigatory Test, Edinburg (BITE) showed a significant increase in the symptom subscale (MD = 0.31, 95% CI = 0.12 to 0.50, p-value = 0.001), however, no significant difference was detected between T1DM and controls in the severity subscale. Prevalence of insulin omission/misuse was 10.3% (95% CI = 8.1-13); diabetic females demonstrated significantly higher risk of insulin omission (RR = 14.21, 95% CI = 2.66 to 76.04, p-value = 0.002) and insulin misuse (RR = 6.51, 95% CI = 1.14 to 37.31, p-value = 0.04) compared with diabetic males. Analysis of other potentially unhealthy weight control behaviors showed insignificant associations between fasting, excessive exercise, dieting pills misuse, diuretics misuse, and T1DM. Conclusions: T1DM patients are at higher risk of developing ED according to both generic and diabetes-validated questionnaires. Moreover, female diabetics are at higher risk of insulin misuse/ omission.

Eating Disorder Screening: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Diagnostic Test Characteristics of the SCOFF,"Kutz, A.M.; Marsh, A.G.; Gunderson, C.G.; Maguen, S.; Masheb, R.M.","Background: Eating disorders affect upwards of 30 million people worldwide and often go undertreated and underdiagnosed. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the Sick, Control, One, Fat and Food (SCOFF) questionnaire for DSM-5 eating disorders in the general population. Method: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) were followed. A PubMed search was conducted among peer-reviewed articles. Information regarding validation of the SCOFF was required for inclusion. Study quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool. Results: The final analysis included 25 studies. The validity of the SCOFF was high across samples with a pooled sensitivity of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.78–0.91) and specificity of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.77–0.88). Subgroup analyses were conducted to examine the impact of methodology, study quality, and clinical characteristics on diagnostic accuracy. Studies with the highest sensitivity tended to be case-control studies of young women with anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN). Studies which included more men, included those diagnosed with binge eating disorder, and recruited from large community samples tended to have lower sensitivity. Few studies reported on BMI and race/ethnicity; thus, subgroups for these factors could not be examined. No studies used reference standards which assessed all DSM-5 eating disorders. Conclusion: This meta-analysis of 25 validation studies demonstrates that the SCOFF is a simple and useful screening tool for young women at risk for AN and BN. However, there is not enough evidence to support utilizing the SCOFF for screening for the range of DSM-5 eating disorders in primary care and community-based settings. Further examination of the validity of the SCOFF or development of a new screening tool, or multiple tools, to screen for the range of DSM-5 eating disorders heterogenous populations is warranted.

A systematic review comparing atypical anorexia nervosa and anorexia nervosa,"Walsh, B. Timothy; Hagan, Kelsey E.; Lockwood, Carlin","Objective: A description of atypical anorexia nervosa (atypical AN) was provided in DSM‐5 in 2013 and a sizable literature has since developed describing the clinical features of individuals with atypical AN and comparing them to those of individuals with anorexia nervosa (AN) and those of healthy individuals. The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review of this literature. Method: A systematic review following PRISMA guidelines was conducted of studies published since 2013 that compared the clinical characteristics of individuals with atypical AN to those of individuals with AN and/or healthy controls. Meta‐analyses were conducted when similar measures were reported in three or more studies. Results: Twenty‐four publications met criteria for inclusion. Their results indicated that the level of eating disorder‐specific psychopathology is significantly higher among individuals with atypical AN than among controls and as high or higher as among individuals with AN while levels of non‐eating disorder psychopathology are similar. Individuals with atypical AN experience many of the physiological complications associated with AN, but some complications appear less frequent. Discussion: The psychological symptoms and physiological complications of individuals with atypical AN are generally similar to those of individuals with AN, although there may be differences in the frequency of some physical complications. Little information is available on the course, outcome, and treatment response of individuals with atypical AN. In addition, full diagnostic criteria for atypical AN have not been developed, and the nosological relationship of atypical AN to established eating disorders such as bulimia nervosa is unclear. Public Significance: Atypical anorexia nervosa as described in the DSM‐5 identifies individuals with many of the psychological characteristics of typical anorexia nervosa who, despite significant weight loss, are not underweight. The current systematic review found that the psychological symptoms and physiological characteristics of individuals with atypical AN are generally similar to those of individuals with AN, although there may be differences in the frequency of some physical complications.

Their co‐occurrence is associated with higher symptom severity and an elevated risk of suicide. In this meta‐analysis, we examine the lifetime prevalence of NSSI in youth with EDs. Methods We searched PsycInfo, PubMed and previously published systematic reviews for studies reporting on lifetime NSSI prevalence among children and adolescents (19 years or younger) with an ED (anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating or other specified feeding and EDs) published until June 2024. A generalized linear mixed model meta‐analysis was performed to estimate the pooled prevalence. Meta‐regressions and multivariate meta‐analyses were conducted to estimate separate prevalence rates based on ED diagnosis and care frame (e.g., inpatient vs. outpatient), respectively. Results Fifteen studies comprising 3311 children and adolescents were included. Pooled lifetime NSSI prevalence across all ED diagnoses was 34.2% [CI: 27.5%–41.7%]. Heterogeneity was large (I2 = 93.8%). Lifetime NSSI prevalence rates were significantly higher for participants with bulimia nervosa (53.6%) and those with anorexia nervosa binge‐eating/purging type (51.9%) than for participants with anorexia nervosa restrictive type (15.8%). Discussion The small number of studies and the large heterogeneity limit the conclusiveness of this meta‐analysis. Results suggest an even higher prevalence of lifetime NSSI in adolescents with an ED than in adults with an ED. The results support previous findings indicating higher prevalence rates of NSSI for EDs associated with binge eating and purging behaviours than for restrictive EDs.

Sleep disturbances in anorexia nervosa,"Burger, Pia; Bos, Rosita W.; Maas, Joyce; Simeunovic‐Ostojic, Mladena; Gemke, Reinoud J. B. J.","Introduction: Sleep is crucial for physical and psychological health, and disturbances are closely linked to psychiatric disorders, making their management essential for improving treatment outcomes and preventing relapse. Although sleep disturbances are implicated in psychopathology of eating disorders, its role in anorexia nervosa (AN) remains unclear. This review aimed to characterise sleep in AN. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in four scientific databases, including papers from inception to 25 May 2024. A machine learning algorithm (ASReview) was utilised to screen titles and abstracts for eligibility. Sleep quantity, architecture, and quality were investigated. Meta‐analyses were conducted to investigate the difference between patients with AN and healthy controls (HC) in total sleep time (TST), wake after sleep onset (WASO), sleep onset latency (SOL), sleep efficiency, Sleep Stage 1, 2, slow wave sleep, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and REM latency. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. Results: Out of 67 potentially eligible papers, 31 were included in this review, with 15 in the meta‐analyses. Statistically significant average mean differences were found for TST (−32.1 min [95% CI: −50.9, −13.4]), WASO (19.0 min [95% CI: −2.4, 40.3]), and sleep efficiency (−4.4% [95% CI: −7.9, −0.9]). Additionally, Sleep stage 1 was significantly increased (2.4% [95%‐CI: 0.05, 4.7]), while REM sleep was reduced (−2.1% [95%‐CI: −4.2, −0.02]). Subgroup analysis showed that TST and WASO did not improve significantly after weight restoration. Conclusion: Sleep in patients with AN is impaired, with lower TST and sleep efficiency, higher WASO, more time in stage 1 sleep, and less in REM. Weight restoration alone may not improve sleep. While more research is needed, substantial accompanying sleep disturbances in AN justifies addressing these in current treatment practice, also because of the chronic character of AN and importance of sleep for long term (mental) health.

Prevalence of binge-eating disorder among children and adolescents: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Kjeldbjerg, Marie Lyngdrup; Clausen, Loa","The objective is to estimate the prevalence of binge-eating disorder (BED) and subclinical BED in children and adolescents. Relevant articles were searched in the databases of PubMED and PsycINFO. Articles were included if they measured BED, subclinical BED, binge eating and/or loss of control (LOC) eating in samples of up to 20 years of age or with a mean age below 20 years. Subclinical BED covers participants with < 4 OBEs but ≥ 1 OBE pr. month and studies measuring subclinical DSM-IV/DSM-5 BED, but where all criteria were not met. All study types and measuring methods were accepted, but studies were excluded if they did not assess and exclude cases of recurrent compensatory behaviors. Meta-analyses were used to obtain an overall estimate of the prevalence of BED and subclinical BED, while stratified meta-analyses were used to assess sources of heterogeneity. 39 studies measuring BED, subclinical BED and/or a low frequency of binge eating were included. Two meta-analyses resulted in an overall estimated prevalence of 1.32% BED and 3.0% subclinical BED in children and adolescents. The results were influenced by high heterogeneity. Potential sources to heterogeneity in the BED result were weight of participants and sample types as well as level of risk of bias in the included studies. BED seems to be as frequent in children and adolescents as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. Hence, treatment of BED and BED symptoms in younger populations should be prioritized on the same terms as anorexia and bulimia nervosa.

A total of 122 studies (range = 4–34 studies across symptoms) were included. Results: Affective instability was the BPD symptom most elevated, while anger was the BPD symptom least elevated, in patients with EDs compared to controls. When comparing effect sizes across ED subtypes, anorexia nervosa binge‐eating/purging subtype had the largest effect sizes for the greatest number of BPD symptoms, while effect sizes for AN restrictive subtype were not significantly larger than those of other EDs for any BPD symptom. The least studied BPD symptoms were identity disturbance and interpersonal difficulties. Discussion: These meta‐analyses suggest that certain symptoms of BPD play a more prominent role in the comorbidity between BPD and EDs than others. Targeting affective instability when treating cases of comorbid ED and BPD may be especially likely to ameliorate the negative outcomes related to this comorbidity. Future research should further investigate identity disturbance and interpersonal difficulties in the context of EDs. Public Significance: Having an eating disorder and borderline personality disorder is a common comorbidity associated with a severe clinical presentation. BPD is characterized by nine distinct symptoms. This research examined levels of individual BPD symptoms in patients with versus without EDs. Findings can guide researchers and clinicians towards studying and treating symptoms that may be most relevant for BPD‐ED comorbidity and in turn, improve outcomes for these patients.

Sin embargo, se desconoce en gran medida hasta qué punto los síntomas individuales del TLP están elevados en pacientes con TCA. Este metaanálisis examino: (1) cuál de los nueve síntomas de TLP está especialmente elevado en individuos con TCA versus sin TCA, (2) si los subtipos particulares de TCA tienen niveles elevados de ciertos síntomas de TLP, y (3) qué síntomas de TLP permanecen sin estudiar/poco estudiados en relacion con los TCA. Métodos: Se realizaron nueve metanálisis separados (uno para cada síntoma de TLP) para comparar los niveles de síntomas en pacientes con TCA versus controles sanos. Se incluyeron un total de 122 estudios (rango = 4–34 estudios entre los síntomas). Resultados: La inestabilidad afectiva fue el síntoma de TLP más elevado, mientras que el enojo fue el síntoma de TLP menos elevado, en pacientes con TCA en comparacion con los controles. Al comparar los tamaños del efecto entre los subtipos de TCA, la anorexia nervosa (AN) subtipo atracon/purgaci on tuvo los tamaños de efecto más grandes para el mayor número de síntomas de TLP, mientras que los tamaños del efecto para la AN subtipo restrictivo no fueron significativamente mayores que los de otros TCA para cualquier síntoma de TLP. Los síntomas de TLP menos estudiados fueron alteracion de la identidad y dificultades interpersonales. Discusion: Estos metanálisis sugieren que ciertos síntomas de TLP juegan un papel más prominente que otros en la comorbilidad entre el TLP y los TCA. Enfocarse en la inestabilidad afectiva al tratar casos de TCA y TLP comorbidos puede ser especialmente probable que mejore los resultados negativos relacionados con esta comorbilidad. Los estudios de investigacion futuros deben investigar más a fondo la alteracion de la identidad y las dificultades interpersonales en el contexto de los TCA.

Efficacy of technology-based eating disorder treatment: A meta-analysis,"Haderlein, Taona Patricia","Technology-based interventions have been shown to reduce maladaptive eating behaviors and associated risk factors. Though several reviews have examined the effectiveness of technology-based interventions for eating problems, this is the first meta-analysis focused solely on controlled trials that include participants with threshold eating disorders. Eleven eligible studies were identified. Significant effects favoring technology-based interventions over waitlist/minimal intervention control were found for global eating pathology, eating concern, objective binge episodes, dietary restraint, shape concern, weight concern, bulimia, drive for thinness, and interoceptive awareness. Limitations of the study include evidence of non-random variation in some pooled effect sizes and a lack of studies with anorexia nervosa patients. The results provide preliminary support for technology-based intervention as a promising strategy for the treatment of threshold eating disorders.

Effectiveness of exercise‐based interventions in patients with anorexia nervosa: A systematic review,"Quiles Marcos, Yolanda; León Zarceño, Eva; López López, José Antonio","Objective: This study aimed to conduct a systematic review of research that has evaluated the outcomes of exercise‐based interventions in anorexia nervosa (AN) patients. Method: We searched for studies in the MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, PsycInfo, Scopus and SPORTDiscus databases. We followed Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta‐Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines throughout the selection process, and used Cochrane tools to assess the risk of bias in the primary studies. In cases where sufficient information was available, outcomes were pooled using meta‐analytic techniques. Results: Ten studies were included in the review. Results showed similar changes in body mass index in both experimental and control conditions (difference in mean changes of -0.53, 95% CI -1.52 to 0.46). We found no differences in depression or anxiety as a result of implementing exercise programmes. Studies using resistance or strength exercise programmes reported an increase in lower and upper body strength and in skeletal muscle mass in the intervention groups. Conclusion: The incorporation of a supervised physical exercise programme to the usual treatment may be appropriate for AN patients. Exercise interventions should only be performed when they are safe for AN patients and should be focused on resistance/strength or flexibility exercises. The results from this systematic review should be interpreted with caution because the studies reviewed showed serious methodological problems.

Peripheral oxytocin concentrations in psychiatric disorders—A systematic review and methanalysis: Further evidence,"Ferreira, Adriana Colar; Osório, Flávia de Lima","Increased interest in understanding how changes in the oxytocinergic system are associated with the etiology and progression of psychiatric disorders has currently boosted the publication of studies. We present a systematic literature review followed by meta-analyses assessing whether peripheral oxytocin (OXT) levels among psychiatric patients differ from healthy controls, considering the moderating role of methodological aspects and samples' characteristics. The following electronic databases were searched: PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, SciELO, LILACS, and Scopus. Fifty-five papers were included in the analysis, and nine independent meta-analyses were performed according to the different diagnoses. Lower OXT concentrations were found in groups of specific disorders (i.e., schizophrenia, restricting and binge-eating/purging subtypes of anorexia nervosa, and borderline personality disorder) with medium to large effect sizes. Great heterogeneity was found among the studies, so that caution is needed to interpret the results. High OXT levels with an effect size of the same magnitude were found for bipolar disorder—type I and obsessive disorder. In contrast, no differences were found for bulimia, autism spectrum, depression, or social anxiety. No meta-analyses were performed for body dysmorphic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, or trichotillomania because only one study was identified for each of these disorders. Altered endogenous OXT concentrations are found in several disorders addressed and must be analyzed according to each disorder's specificities.

Neuropsychopharmacological and Behavioural Mechanisms Underlying Eating Behaviour and Disordered Eating Behaviour,"Schneider, Elizabeth","The overall aim of this thesis was to understand the mechanisms underlying eating behaviour in healthy and disordered eating samples with a particular focus on homeostatic, reward, and cognitive processes. Chapter 1 provides a general background to the research area. In Chapter 2, experimental findings suggest women with obesity are more sensitive to the beneficial appetitive and mood effects of exogenous insulin compared to lean women. Results of a systematic review and meta-analysis in Chapter 3 suggest that the only drug approved to treat Binge Eating Disorder (BED), lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (LDX), improves binge-eating symptoms through combined catecholaminergic and serotoninergic mediated actions on appetite, reward, and cognitive processes including attention and inhibition. Chapter 4 aimed to experimentally determine the behavioural mechanisms underlying LDX treatment of BED. LDX-induced reductions in food intake, eating rate and palatability, and improvement in sustained attention and impulsive responding supporting the possibility that LDX acts on appetite, reward, and cognition mechanisms to treat binge eating with a specific effect to increase cognitive control. Chapter 5 summarises the main findings of Chapters 2-4 and discusses the implications of the results. The findings of this thesis provide support for an interactive model of appetite control that emphasises cross talk between homeostatic, reward, and cognitive processes. The results suggest that further investigation of IN insulin as a weight management option for women with obesity is warranted and that novel therapeutics aimed at treating BED might target multiple mechanisms including satiety, reward, and cognitive control. The experimental designs used in this thesis also provide a validated paradigm for testing the efficacy of novel compounds to treat BED.",2021,,PQDT - UK & Ireland,,30474507,,2796884558,,,#1371,Schneider 2021,,,
An Evaluation of Autism Spectrum Disorder Traits and the Social and Emotional Cognition of Adolescents with Anorexia Nervosa,"Mulligan, Shane","The purpose of the present dissertation is to investigate Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) traits and aspects social and emotional functioning consistent with ASD among young people with Anorexia Nervosa (AN). This dissertation is made up of four sections; (1) Literature review: The literature review will consider the aetiology of AN and ASD, their clinical presentation, overlap between the disorders and the theories underlying the aetiology of both conditions. Literature relating specifically to ASD and associated traits with respect to social and emotional functioning in AN will be examined. This will be followed by the theoretical positions proposed to explain the presence of traits consistent with ASD in AN which frame the research questions. (2) Systematic review and meta-analysis: Title: Using the Autism-Spectrum Quotient to Measure Autistic Traits in Adolescents and Young People with Anorexia Nervosa: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis The principal focus of the systematic review and meta-analysis is to understand the prevalence of ASD traits as measured by one of the most commonly used screening measures of Autism traits in AN, the Autism Quotient (AQ) and AQ short version, the AQ10. The systematic review and meta-analysis was limited to studies conducted with adolescents and young people under the age of 25 with AN to assess the prevalence of ASD traits prior to prolonged periods of nutritional deprivation. This is presented through a specific journal article format. (3) Empirical research written in specific journal article format: Title: An Evaluation of Autism Spectrum Disorder Traits and the Social and Emotional Cognition of Adolescents with Anorexia Nervosa The empirical research is presented in two parts, the first of which is in a journal article form tailored to the format of a specific academic journal. This incorporates the most relevant aspects of the literature review in addition to the methodology, results and discussion of the present empirical research study. The second part presents the empirical research through a supplementary methodology, results and discussion section which follow sequentially from the literature review (Section 4). The original empirical research section of the dissertation seeks to investigate traits consistent with ASD and related aspects of social and emotional cognition among young people with AN. ASD is proposed to exist on a spectrum where more pronounced ASD traits are often associated with functional impairment in social functioning, language, communication and restricted/repetitive interests. At the less pronounced end of the spectrum ASD traits are considered more subtle and not generally associated with functional impairment. Research with AN groups has indicated that a considerable percentage of these research samples meet the criteria for ASD. Prior research has also indicated that among those individuals with AN not meeting the full criteria for an ASD diagnosis commonly have increased levels of ASD traits as compared to control populations. The purpose of the present research is to understanding if commonly reported ASD traits and difficulties with social and emotional cognition with ASD are present in the early stages of AN prior to prolonged nutritional deprivation. Within previous literature, traits associated with ASD have been studied individually among groups with AN. This study is the first to examine ASD traits, theory of mind, alexithymia and empathy simultaneously in an adolescent group with AN. The study assumes a cross-sectional design where participants consist of two adolescent groups; individuals with AN attending a specialist eating disorder service and a healthy control group recruited from the community through secondary schools. The study collected participant demographic, clinical symptoms and illness-related variables in addition to self-reported ASD traits, a theory of mind task, and measures of alexithymia and empathy. Data were analysed by comparing group means across dependent variables. AN group-specific analyses were conducted using correlational analyses to examine relationships between dependant variables. Findings are presented in the context of prior literature.

Update on the Global Prevalence of Pica in Pregnant Women: A Meta-analysis,"Sanjari, S.; Soleimani, M.R.M.; Fakhraei, A.A.","Objectives: Pregnancy pica is harmful to the mother and her baby. This study aimed to update the global prevalence of pica in pregnant women. Methods: Scopus, Science Direct, Wiley online, Google Scholar, and PubMed databases were searched for observational studies until July 2021. This search was done with the keywords “pregnancy pica”, “prevalence of pica”, “pica frequency”. After evaluating the extracted studies based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, 45 final articles were selected. Calculations were performed based on STATA software. Publication bias was also assessed. Results: The global prevalence of pica in pregnancy in the final forty-five articles (Sample size: 21 267) was 34%. However, the prevalence has decreased since 2015. In the subgroup analysis, rural women, women with lower education, younger women, unemployed women, and women living in the African geographical area had the highest prevalence of pica. Our results also showed that this rate was higher in women in the first trimester of pregnancy and multiparous women. Conclusions: The global prevalence of pica was 34%.
