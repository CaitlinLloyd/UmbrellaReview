    "abstract": "Parents' child feeding practices are influenced not only by family but also by a broader circle of networks, including online groups. Peer\u2010to\u2010peer platforms such as Facebook groups facilitate a learning environment and may influence the transmission of user\u2010generated content into practice. These digital data not only benefit participants but also offer new opportunities for researchers to study related phenomena. Therefore, this study employs thematic content analysis to investigate peer\u2010exchanging discourse conveyed in Facebook peer\u2010support groups in children's diets in Thailand. To identify the area of interest, we classified and quantified the initial posts and investigated the relationship between initial posts' contents and community engagement. Thematic analysis was used to qualitatively describe the peer\u2010exchanging content that responded to the initial posts. Of the five approved Facebook groups, 200 initial posts with their 1964 comments were extracted anonymously. Results revealed that Facebook groups devoted to diets for children have become a platform for Thai parents to seek informational and emotional support. The top\u2010ranked initial posts were related to requesting knowledge and skills about age\u2010appropriate food and meal preparation. Parents have also expressed anxiety about feeding and tension related to food fussiness which created the need for emotional support. Age\u2010appropriate feeding, homemade baby foods, concerns about food seasonings and food allergy awareness were observable within online groups. However, a shift from traditional child feeding practices to new ideas created cultural gaps which lead to arguments in some families. Understanding these views would help guide to address parental concerns better.",

    "abstract": "Oral motor dysfunction is a common issue in children with cerebral palsy (CP). Drooling, difficulties with sucking, swallowing, and chewing are some of the problems often seen. In this study, we aimed to research the effect of oral motor therapy on pediatric CP patients with feeding problems. Included in this single centered, randomized, prospective study were 81 children aged 12-42 months who had been diagnosed with CP, had oral motor dysfunction and were observed at the Pediatric Neurology outpatient clinic of the Children's Health and Diseases Department, Istanbul Medical Faculty, Istanbul University. Patients were randomized into two groups: The training group and the control group. One patient from the training group dropped out of the study because of not participating regularly. Following initial evaluation of all patients by a blinded physiotherapist and pedagogue, patients in the training group participated in 1 h oral motor training sessions with a different physiotherapist once a week for 6 months. All patients kept on routine physiotherapy by their own physiotherapists. Oral motor assessment form, functional feeding assessment (FFA) subscale of the multidisciplinary feeding profile (MFP) and the Bayley scales of infant development (BSID-II) were used to evaluate oral motor function, swallowing, chewing, the gag reflex, the asymmetrical tonic neck reflex, tongue, jaw, and mouth function, severity of drooling, aspiration, choking, independent feeding and tolerated food texture during the initial examination and 6 months later. When the initial and post-therapy FFA and BSID-II scores received by patients in the training and the study group were compared, the training group showed a statistically significant improvement ( P < 0.05). Oral motor therapy has a beneficial effect on feeding problems in children with CP.",

    "abstract": "Corn Soy Blend (CSB) porridge is commonly prepared with oil for treatment of moderate acute malnutrition (MAM). A recent review recommended that 30\u00a0g of oil be used with 100\u00a0g of CSB to increase energy density and micronutrient absorption. This study assessed the effectiveness and cost\u2010effectiveness of program changes aimed at achieving that target oil:CSB ratio in prepared porridge. Caregivers of children in MAM supplementary feeding programs were assigned to three groups: a control group received monthly rations of 1\u00a0L oil, 8\u00a0kg CSB in bulk, and social and behavior change communication (SBCC); intervention groups received 2.6\u00a0L oil, 8\u00a0kg CSB provided either in bulk (Group 1) or four 2\u2010kg packages with printed messages (Group 2), and enhanced SBCC emphasizing the target oil:CSB ratio. Compared to the control, both intervention groups had higher mean added oil per 100\u00a0g CSB (18\u00a0g, p\u00a0< 0.01, and 13\u00a0g, p =\u00a00.04, higher in groups 1 and 2, respectively), and greater odds of meeting or exceeding the target ratio (28.4, p <\u00a00.01, and 12.7, p =\u00a00.02, in groups 1 and 2, respectively). Cost per caregiver reaching the target ratio was most favorable in Group 1 ($391 in Group 1, $527 in Group 2, and $1,666 in the control). Enhanced SBCC combined with increased oil ration resulted in increased use of oil in CSB porridge in a supplementary feeding program. Modified packaging did not improve effectiveness. However, both interventions were more cost\u2010effective than standard programming.",

    "abstract": "Healthy eating is a critical aspect of the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Disrupted eating patterns can result in poor glucose control and increase the likelihood of diabetic complications. Teneligliptin inhibits dipeptidyl peptidase-4 activity for 24\u00a0h and suppresses postprandial hyperglycemia after all three daily meals. This interim analysis of data from the large-scale post-marketing surveillance of teneligliptin (RUBY) in Japan examined eating patterns and their relationship with metabolic parameters and diabetic complications. We also examined whether eating patterns affected safety and efficacy of teneligliptin. We analyzed baseline data from survey forms collected in RUBY between May 2013 and June 2017, including patient characteristics, metabolic parameters, and eating patterns (eating three meals per day or not; timing of evening meal) before teneligliptin treatment was initiated. Safety and efficacy of 12\u00a0months\u2019 teneligliptin (20\u201340\u00a0mg/day) treatment was assessed. Data from 10,532 patients were available for analysis. Most patients who did not eat three meals per day ( n =757) or who ate their evening meal after\u00a010 PM ( n =206) were 64\u00a0years old or younger. At baseline, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass index, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase levels were higher in those patients who did not eat three meals per day ( p <\u20090.05) or who ate their evening meal late ( p <\u20090.05). Diabetic complications were more common in patients who did not eat three meals per day. Treatment with teneligliptin reduced HbA1c over 6 or 12\u00a0months across all eating patterns, with a low incidence of adverse drug reactions. Eating patterns may be associated with altered metabolic parameters and diabetic complications among Japanese patients with T2DM. Teneligliptin may be well tolerated and improve hyperglycemia in patients with T2DM irrespective of eating patterns. Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation and Daiichi Sankyo Co. Ltd. Japic CTI-153047.

    "abstract": "To assess the impact of separation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive mother\u2013newborn dyads on breastfeeding outcomes. This observational longitudinal cohort study of mothers with SARS-CoV-2 PCR-and their infants at 3 NYU Langone Health hospitals was conducted between March 25, 2020, and May 30, 2020. Mothers were surveyed by telephone regarding predelivery feeding plans, in-hospital feeding, and home feeding of their neonates. Any change prompted an additional question to determine whether this change was due to coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). Of the 160 mother\u2013newborn dyads, 103 mothers were reached by telephone, and 85 consented to participate. There was no significant difference in the predelivery feeding plan between the separated and unseparated dyads ( P = .268). Higher rates of breastfeeding were observed in the unseparated dyads compared with the separated dyads both in the hospital ( P <\u00a0.001) and at home ( P =\u00a0.012). Only 2 mothers in each group reported expressed breast milk as the hospital feeding source (5.6% of unseparated vs 4.1% of separated). COVID-19 was more commonly cited as the reason for change in the separated group (49.0% vs 16.7%; P <\u00a0.001). When the dyads were further stratified by symptom status into 4 groups\u2014asymptomatic separated, asymptomatic unseparated, symptomatic separated, and symptomatic unseparated\u2014the results remained unchanged. In the setting of COVID-19, separation of mother\u2013newborn dyads impacts breastfeeding outcomes, with lower rates of breastfeeding both during hospitalization and at home following discharge compared with unseparated mothers and infants. No evidence of vertical transmission was observed; 1 case of postnatal transmission occurred from an unmasked symptomatic mother who held her infant at birth.",

We show for the first time that activity of the ZI to VTA projection promotes feeding, which improves the understanding of the neurobiology of feeding behaviour and body weight regulation. Both the zona incerta (ZI) and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) have been implicated in feeding behaviour. The ZI provides prominent input to the VTA, although it has not yet been investigated whether this projection regulates feeding. Therefore, we investigated the role of ZI to VTA projection neurons in the regulation of several aspects of feeding behaviour. We determined the effects of (in)activation of ZI to VTA projection neurons on feeding microstructure, food\u2010motivated behaviour under a progressive ratio schedule of reinforcement, locomotor activity and core body temperature. To activate or inactivate ZI neurons projecting to the VTA, we used a combination of canine adenovirus\u20102 in the VTA, as well as Cre\u2010dependent designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADD) or tetanus toxin (TetTox) light chain in the ZI. TetTox\u2010mediated inactivation of ZI to VTA projection neurons reduced food\u2010motivated behaviour and feeding by reducing meal frequency. Conversely, DREADD\u2010mediated chemogenetic activation of ZI to VTA projection neurons promoted food\u2010motivated behaviour and feeding. (In)activation of ZI to VTA projection neurons did not affect locomotor activity or directly regulate core body temperature. Taken together, ZI neurons projecting to the VTA exert bidirectional control overfeeding behaviour. More specifically, activity of ZI to VTA projection neurons facilitate action initiation towards feeding, as reflected in both food\u2010motivated behaviour and meal initiation, without affecting general activity.

    "abstract": "The global coronavirus pandemic (Covid 19) resulted in national lockdowns where individuals were asked to isolate in their homes to stop the spread of the disease. Using a cross-sectional survey, the current paper aimed to examine self-reported changes in eating patterns and behaviour during the lockdown in the UK, and associations with BMI, demographic variables, eating styles, health anxiety, food insecurity and coping strategies. Participants ( N =\u00a0620) were recruited online through social media advertising. The results showed that there were self-reported changes to food consumption during the lockdown across the sample. Increases in consumption of HED (high energy density) snack foods during the lockdown was associated with sex, pre-lockdown eating behaviour (emotional eating and uncontrolled eating), and Covid-specific health anxiety. Increases in positive eating practices such as eating more home prepared foods, and fruits and vegetables, were associated with adaptive coping strategies. Higher emotional eating (EE) during the lockdown was associated with a higher BMI, higher pre-lockdown EE and maladaptive coping strategies. Maladaptive coping strategies moderated the relationship between BMI and EE during the lockdown. In particular a higher BMI was associated with higher EE during the lockdown if an individual also had higher maladaptive coping strategies. These findings suggest that changes to eating behaviour may be part of a wider style of maladaptive or adaptive coping, particularly in those with a history of EE or uncontrolled eating. Preparing individuals to adopt more adaptive coping strategies during lockdown situations may be crucial to improving health during subsequent the lockdown events.",

The present study aimed at evaluating hunger-based early feeding for its efficacy in reducing length of hospitalisation. This was a parallel arm superiority randomized control trial. Patients with moderate and severe acute pancreatitis were randomised into hunger-based feeding and conventional feeding groups. Patients in hunger-based feeding group commenced feeding once they felt hungry and in conventional feeding group after normalization of biochemical parameters and resolution of symptoms. Patients were followed up till their discharge and were analyzed for length of hospitalisation, fasting duration, feed intolerance, incidence of infective morbidities and invasive procedures. Hunger-based feeding and conventional feeding group included 56 and 54 patients, respectively. Hunger-based feeding led to a decrease in length of hospitalization (6.3\u00a0days in hunger-based feeding vs 7.3\u00a0days in conventional feeding group, P =\u20090.041) and fasting duration (1.6\u00a0days in hunger-based feeding vs 2.7\u00a0days in conventional feeding group, P =\u20090.001).The incidence of feed intolerance ( P =\u20090.098), infective morbidities and invasive non-surgical procedures were similar in both the groups.

The study included three groups matched for age and gender: treatment seeking outpatients with PB (PB+), treatment seeking psychiatric inpatients without PB (PB\u2212), and a healthy control group (HC). PB was assessed by means of the Compulsive Buying Scale and by the impulse control disorder (ICD) module of the research version of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-ICD). All participants answered questionnaires concerning symptoms of borderline personality disorder, self-harming behaviors, binge eating and symptoms of attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In addition, comorbid ICDs were assessed using the SCID-ICD. The PB+ and PB\u2212 groups did not differ with regard to borderline personality disorder or ADHD symptoms, but both groups reported significantly more symptoms than the HC group. Frequencies of self-harming behaviors did not differ between the three groups. Patients with PB were more often diagnosed with any current ICD (excluding PB) compared to those without PB and the HC group (38.7% vs. 12.9% vs. 12.9%, respectively, p =.017). Our findings confirm prior research suggesting more impulsive behaviors in patients with and without PB compared to healthy controls. The results of the questionnaire-based assessment indicate that outpatients with PB perceive themselves equally impulsive and self-harm as frequently as inpatients without PB; but they seem to suffer more often from an ICD as assessed by means of an interview.",

We prospectively investigated a subgroup of patients included in a multicentre, nutritional trial (EFFORT) for the occurrence of RFS. In this secondary analysis of a randomized-controlled trial investigating the effects of nutritional support in malnourished medical inpatients, we prospectively screened patients for RFS and classified them as \u201cRFS confirmed\u201d and \u201cRFS not confirmed\u201d based on predefined criteria (i.e. electrolyte shifts, clinical symptoms, clinical context, and patient history). We assessed associations of RFS and mortality within 180 days (primary endpoint) and other secondary endpoints using multivariable regression analysis. Among 967 included patients, RFS was confirmed in 141 (14.6%) patients. Compared to patients with no evidence for RFS, patients with confirmed RFS had significantly increased 180-days mortality rates (42/141 (29.8%) vs 181/826 (21.9%), adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.53 (95% CI 1.02 to 2.29), P <\u200a.05).

We reviewed 218 intubated patients at Stony Brook University Hospital and stratified them into three groups based on AGI severity, according to data collected in the first 10 days of ICU course. We used chi-square test to compare categorical variables such as age and sex and two-sample t -test or Mann-Whitney U -tests for continuous variables, including important laboratory values. Cox proportional hazards regression models were utilized to determine whether AGI score was an independent predictor of survival, and multivariable analysis was performed to compare risk factors that were deemed significant in the univariable analysis. We performed Kaplan-Meier survival analysis based on the AGI score and the presence of FI. The overall incidence of AGI was 95% (45% AGI I/II, 50% AGI III/IV), and FI incidence was 63%. Patients with AGI III/IV were more likely to have prolonged mechanical ventilation (22 days vs 16 days, P -value < 0.002) and higher mortality rate (58% vs 28%, P -value <0.001) compared to patients with AGI 0/I/II. This was confirmed with multivariable analysis which showed that AGI score III/IV was an independent predictor of higher mortality (AGI III/IV vs AGI 0/I/II hazard ratio (HR), 2.68; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.69\u20134.25; P -value < 0.0001). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that both AGI III/IV and FI ( P -value <0.001) were associated with worse outcomes. Patients with AGI III/IV had higher daily and mean D-dimer and CRP levels compared to AGI 0/I/II ( P -value <0.0001). The prevalence of AGI and FI among critically ill COVID-19 patients was high. AGI grades III/IV were associated with higher risk for prolonged mechanical ventilation and mortality compared to AGI 0/I/II, while it also correlated with higher D-dimer and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. FI was independently associated with higher mortality. The development of high-grade AGI and FI during the first days of ICU stay can serve as prognostic tools to predict outcomes in critically ill COVID-19 patients.",

There were no significant differences between the AN patients and controls regarding absolute regional band amplitudes in \u03bcV. Borderline significance was found for anterior theta ( P =0.051). Significantly increased left and right frontal electrode theta amplitude was found in AN patients (F3, P =0.014; F4, P =0.038) compared to controls. Significant differences were also observed for secondary variables: lower values for relative parietooccipital delta and frontocentral alpha activity among AN patients than among controls. We observed slight excess frontal theta and lower relative alpha and delta amplitudes among AN patients than among controls. This pattern is possibly related to a slight frontal lobe dysfunction in AN, or it may reflect increased attention/vigilance or another state-related change in patients with AN compared to healthy controls.",

We made an attempt to study the prevalence of ED in the student population of Mysore, South India. A total of 1600 students aged 15\u201325 years and residing in Mysore were surveyed using two standardized questionnaires. Among the 417 students who scored higher in the questionnaires, 35 students were recruited as participants. Another 35 students with low scores were considered controls. A series of anthropometric measurements were conducted along with the establishment of a register on their well-being and family history. Hemoglobin (Hb) content was measured using a Hb test kit from Beacon Diagnostics Pvt., Ltd., India. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 14.01 software utilizing analysis of variance tool. It was found that 26.06% of participants were prone to ED due to their abnormal eating attitudes. We also observed significant differences between the controls and participants in relation to various parameters such as weight, waist and hip circumferences, body mass index, basal metabolic rate, fat percentage. Hb content was normal in both controls and participants. The establishment of the register also revealed that the onset of menstruation differed significantly between the controls and participants. We arrived at the conclusion that ED are definitely prevailing among the students of Karnataka and have a profound effect on the mental and physical health of the students with eating discrepancies.",

Smoke-induced mutagenicity at air agar interface was developed and validated. The VITROCELL \u00ae VC10 \u00ae system was validated by equipment qualification protocols. Differentiation of mutagenicity by 3R4F and Eclipse cigarettes was demonstrated. The Ames test has established use in the assessment of potential mutagenicity of tobacco products but has generally been performed using partitioned exposures (e.g. total particulate matter [TPM], gas vapor phase [GVP]) rather than whole smoke (WS). The VITROCELL \u00ae VC10 \u00ae smoke exposure system offers multiple platforms for air liquid interface (ALI), or air agar interface (AAI) in the case of the Ames test exposure to mimic in vivo -like conditions for assessing the toxicological impact of fresh WS in in vitro assays. The goals of this study were to 1) qualify the VITROCELL \u00ae VC10 \u00ae to demonstrate functionality of the system, 2) develop and validate the Ames test following WS exposure with the VITROCELL \u00ae VC10 \u00ae and 3) assess the ability of the Ames test to differentiate between a reference combustible product (3R4F Kentucky reference cigarette) and a primarily tobacco heating product (Eclipse). Based on critical function assessments, the VITROCELL \u00ae VC10 \u00ae was demonstrated to be fit for the purpose of consistent generation of WS. Assay validation was conducted for 5 bacterial strains (TA97, TA98, TA100, TA1535 and TA102) and reproducible exposure\u2013related changes in revertants were observed for TA98 and TA100 in the presence of rat liver S-9 following exposure to 3R4F WS. In the comparative studies, exposure-related changes in in vitro mutagenicity following exposure of TA98 and TA100 in the presence of S9 to both 3R4F and Eclipse WS were observed, with the response for Eclipse being significantly less than that for 3R4F (p\u202f<\u202f0.001) which is consistent with the fewer chemical constituents liberated by primarily-heating the product.",

We conducted a single-center, single-blinded, prospective clinical trial. Sixty-three patients were treated with a non-gravity type gastrointestinal feeding tube using different procedures: modified bedside post-pyloric feeding tube placement (M group), the conventional Corpak protocol (C group), and standard electromagnetic-guided tube placement (EM group). The success rate in the M group, C group, and EM group was 82.9% (34/41), 70.7% (29/41), and 88.2% (15/17), respectively, with significant differences among the groups. The time required to pass the pylorus was significantly shorter in the M group (26.9 minutes) than in the C group (31.9 minutes) and EM group (42.1 minutes). The proportion of pylorus-passing operations completed within 30 minutes was significantly higher in the M group than in the C group and EM group. No severe complications occurred. This modified method of bedside post-pyloric feeding tube catheterization significantly shortened the time required to pass the pylorus with no severe adverse reactions. This method is effective and safe for enteral nutrition catheterization of patients with dysphagia and a high risk of aspiration pneumonia.",

Computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, single photon emission computed tomography, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and voxel-based morphometry have been the most relevant technologies in this regard. The purpose of this review is to update the existing data on neuroimaging in eating disorders. The main brain changes seem to be reversible to some extent after adequate weight restoration. Brain changes in bulimia nervosa seem to be less pronounced than in anorexia nervosa and are mainly due to chronic dietary restrictions. Different subtypes of eating disorders might be correlated with specific brain functional changes. Moreover, anorectic patients who binge/purge may have different functional brain changes compared with those who do not binge/purge. Functional changes in the brain might have prognostic value, and different changes with receptors may be persistent after respect to the binding potential of 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 2A , and D 2 /D 3 recovering from an eating disorder.",

Ten (10) of steers were sampled from a commercial population; carcasses with QG 1 ++ (n=5) and QG 1 (n=5) were chosen. Samples were cooked by electric oven at 60 or 82\u2103 and compared with uncooked control samples. The pH was not affected by cooking temperature but decreased the redness after cooking and steaks cooked at 60\u2103 were more reddish than steaks cooked at 82\u2103 in both QG groups. Higher cooking temperature greatly ( p <0.05) increased the cooking loss, but there was no significant interaction between cooking temperature and QG on the cooking loss. Moisture is negatively correlated with temperature in both QG while the proportionate relationship between crude fat and end-point temperature found in QG 1 ++ . WBSF values were significantly ( p <0.05) high for QG 1, while that was significantly ( p <0.05) increased when the temperature continues to increase. The increasing quality grade of beef resulted in significant higher ( p <0.01) level of TBARS and cooking temperature increased TBARS content. Fatty acid composition was not altered by cooking at both temperatures and also the amount of fat intake was not changed. The current study indicates that eating quality of beef m. longissimus was greatly influenced by end-point temperature being interacted with QG. However, the amount and composition of fat were stable regardless of end-point temperatures. These results will provide a consumer reference to determine cooking conditions and intramuscular fat content.",

Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate the hepatic histological characteristics and biochemical markers of hepatic steatosis in Wistar rats with refeeding syndrome. Thirty male Wistar rats were allocated to one of three groups: C, F or R. The animals from group C received an AIN-93 diet for 96 hours, and were then sacrificed. Animals allocated to group F were fasted for 48 hours and sacrificed. Animals from group R were also fasted for 48 hours, but were refed for another 48 hours, with AIN-93. The liver, blood and epididymal and retroperitoneal fats were collected. Data obtained in groups F and R show the changes observed in refeeding syndrome, during starvation and refeeding. The serum glucose, magnesium, potassium and phosphorus, in group F, decreased. There was no evidence of hepatic steatosis. Hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia were also observed in group R, confirming refeeding syndrome. The main histological characteristic, in this group, was the extensive presence of ballooning degeneration. This is the first article that has detected such change in liver structure, due to refeeding syndrome. The possible causes are: retention of sodium, causing whole body edema; and/or dysfunction of the sodium/potassium pump of the hepatocytes, as a result of hypophosphatemia. This is the first description of an animal model of hepatic severe ballooning degeneration induced due to refeeding syndrome.",

Epidemics are well-known to cause mental distress, and patients with a current or past history of obesity are at increased risk for the common presence of psychological comorbidities. This study investigates the psychological impact of the current pandemic in patients participating in a bariatric surgery program. Patients were consecutively enrolled during the Italian lockdown among those waiting for bariatric surgery or attending a post-bariatric follow-up, and were asked to complete through an online platform the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 and a self-assessment questionnaire of 22 items evaluating the resilience, change in eating behavior and emotional responses referring to the ongoing pandemic. 59% of the 434 enrolled subjects reported of being worried about the pandemic, and 63% specifically reported of being worried about their or their relatives\u2019 health. 37% and 56% felt lonelier and more bored, respectively. 66% was hungrier with increased frequency of snacking (55%) and 39% reported more impulse to eat. Noteworthy, 49% felt unable to follow a recommended diet. No difference in terms of psychological profile was recorded among pre and post-bariatric subjects. Logistic regression analysis on post-bariatric patients showed a relationship between snacking, hunger, eating impulsivity, and anxiety, stress, and/or depression symptoms. The pandemic led to increased psychological distress in patients with a current or past history of obesity, reducing quality of life and affecting dietary compliance. Targeted psychological support is warranted in times of increased stress for fragile subjects such as pre- and post-bariatric patients. Level V: cross-sectional\u00a0descriptive study.

In this study, post hoc analyses examined the relationships between clinical observations and clinical rating scales in individuals with BED. NCT01718483 ( ClinicalTrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01718483 ); NCT01718509 ( ClinicalTrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01718509 ). Two 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies randomized (1:1) adults meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fourth Edition, Text Revision, BED criteria and with protocol-defined moderate to severe BED (study 1, N=383; study 2, N=390) to placebo or dose-optimized LDX (50 or 70 mg). Assessments included the number of BE days/week, CGI\u2013Severity (CGI-S) and CGI-I scores, and Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale modified for Binge Eating (Y-BOCS-BE) total scores. For these post hoc analyses, data were pooled across studies and treatment arms. Statistical assessments included Spearman correlations and equipercentile linking analyses (ELA). Reported P -values are nominal (descriptive and not adjusted for multiplicity). At baseline, nominally significant correlations with CGI-S scores were reported for BE days/week ( r =0.374; P <0.0001) and Y-BOCS-BE total scores ( r =0.319; P <0.0001). Baseline ELA for CGI-S further characterized this relationship: a CGI-S score of 4 (moderately ill) corresponding to 3.504 BE days/week and a Y-BOCS-BE total score of 18.6. Nominally significant correlations with CGI-I scores were reported for changes from baseline at study endpoint for BE days/week ( r =0.647; P <0.0001) and Y-BOCS-BE total scores ( r =0.741; P <0.0001). ELA for CGI-I scores at study endpoint showed that a CGI-I score of 1 (very much improved) corresponds to a reduction from baseline of 4.504 BE days/week and 19.4 points for Y-BOCS-BE total score. These post hoc analyses suggest that indices of global disease severity and improvement positively correlate with BE behavior and with obsessive and compulsive features of BED, measured by the Y-BOCS-BE, supporting the clinical relevance of BED treatment outcomes.",

    "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune inflammatory demyelinating central nervous system disorder that is more common in women, with onset often during reproductive years. The female:male sex ratio of MS rose in several regions over the last century, suggesting a possible sex by environmental interaction increasing MS risk in women. Since many with MS are in their childbearing years, family planning, including contraceptive and disease-modifying therapy (DMT) counselling, are important aspects of MS care in women. While some DMTs are likely harmful to the developing fetus, others can be used shortly before or until pregnancy is confirmed. Overall, pregnancy decreases risk of MS relapses, whereas relapse risk may increase postpartum, although pregnancy does not appear to be harmful for long-term prognosis of MS. However, ovarian aging may contribute to disability progression in women with MS. Here, we review sex effects across the lifespan in women with MS, including the effect of sex on MS susceptibility, effects of pregnancy on MS disease activity, and management strategies around pregnancy, including risks associated with DMT use before and during pregnancy, and while breastfeeding. We also review reproductive aging and sexual dysfunction in women with MS.",

In exploring these bioeconomies, I draw together two approaches to biocapital not often put into conversation with one another: a focus on the micrological generative capacities of biological material, and attention to the macrological biopolitical governance of populations. I argue that juxtaposing these bioeconomies demonstrates key features of human milk biocapital: the multi-scalar workings of reproductive biopolitical valuation and governance; the human and more-than-human ecologies (and labours) on which biocapital depends; and the feminist geographical contestations that shape, and sometimes undermine, these valuations.",

But there have been few studies on the relationship between the intensity of drinking and metabolic syndrome when drinking the same amount of alcohol. This study aimed to assess the relationship between the frequency of binge drinking and metabolic syndrome in Korean adult men. From the database of the 4th and 5th Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted in 2007-2010, data of 8,305 adult men (\u226519 years of age) was included in this analysis. Cross-sectional relationship between the frequency of binge drinking and metabolic syndrome was investigated adjusting for pure alcohol consumed per day. Adjusting for various confounders including pure alcohol consumed per day, the adjusted odds ratio for metabolic syndrome in those in higher frequency (more than 1/wk) binge drinking group was 1.62 (95% confidence interval, 1.30 to 2.03; P for trend = <0.001) compared to those in the non-binge drinking group. Through analysis of the relationship between pure alcohol consumed per day and metabolic syndrome, it was found that pure alcohol consumed per day had a positive relation to metabolic syndrome in the higher frequency binge drinking group (P for trend = 0.041). The relationship was inverse in the non-binge drinking group (P for trend = 0.002). Our study found a positive relationship between frequency of binge drinking and metabolic syndrome in adult men. And the effect of drinking on metabolic syndrome may depend on the frequency of binge drinking. Further studies are required to confirm this association.",

We designed a multicenter randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GL in neonates with coffee-ground emesis. Vigorous neonates with birth weight ranging from 2500 g to 3999 g and gestational age between 37w0d and 41w6d who presented with coffee-ground emesis on more than twice and diagnosed as false melena, were divided into two groups using computerized randomization. We defined feeding intolerance (FI) as (1) \u22652 vomiting episodes in 4h or \u22653 episodes in 24h and/or (2) feeding failure on at least two occasions because of retching or poor sucking. Primary outcome is percentage of infants who present FI within 24 hours from admission. We also assessed the residual volumes, number of vomiting episodes, percentage of weight reduction at postnatal day 4, rates of body weight gain at 1 month of age, and peak serum total bilirubin value before discharge. To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of GL for neonates with coffee-ground emesis.

Nominal steady state friction values ( \u03bc nss ) in gouge at V = 1 m/s are larger than in bare surfaces for all \u03c3 n tested and demonstrate a strong \u03c3 n dependence; \u03bc nss decreased from 0.51 at 4.0 MPa to 0.39 at 22.4 MPa. Conversely, \u03bc nss values for bare surfaces remained \u223c0.1 with increasing \u03c3 n and V . Additionally, the velocity at the onset of frictional weakening and the amount of slip prior to weakening were orders of magnitude larger in gouge than in bare surfaces. Extrapolation of the normal stress dependence for \u03bc nss suggests that the behavior of antigorite gouge approaches that of bare surfaces at \u03c3 n \u2265 60 MPa. X-ray diffraction revealed dehydration reaction products in samples that frictionally weakened. Microstructural analysis revealed highly localized slip zones with melt-like textures in some cases gouge experiments and in all bare surfaces experiments for V \u2265 1 m/s. One-dimensional thermal modeling indicates that flash heating causes frictional weakening in both bare surfaces and gouge. Friction values for gouge decrease at higher velocities and after longer displacements than bare surfaces because strain is more distributed. Gouge friction approaches that of bare surfaces at high normal stress Dehydration reactions and bulk melting in serpentinite in < 1 m of slip Flash heating causes dynamic frictional weakening in gouge and bare surfaces",

First, electrical impedance of the vagina was conducted to test estrous cycle adjustment. Second, the effects of 6 h per day maternal separation from birth to weaning, which models a psychologically stressful experience in childhood, was used to test feeding behavior during an ovarian cycle in female adult rats with matched estrous cycles. Food and water intake in maternal separated and non-separated rats was measured in each estrous phase. Non-separated rats showed periodical changes, but maternal separated rats showed no significant changes in food and water intake during an estrous cycle. An opposing tendency for food and water intake was seen between maternal separated and non-separated rats. These observations suggest that electrical impedance of the vagina showed the highest value in the estrous phase of rats housed in a reversed light-dark cycle, and maternal separation was found to disturb changes in feeding behavior during the estrous cycle.",

    "abstract": "Telomeres are nucleoprotein complexes that form the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes where they protect DNA from genomic instability, prevent end-to-end fusion and limit cellular replicative capabilities. Increased telomere attrition rates, and relatively shorter telomere length, is associated with genomic instability and has been linked with several chronic diseases, malignancies and reduced longevity. Telomeric DNA is highly susceptible to oxidative damage and dietary habits may make an impact on telomere attrition rates through the mediation of oxidative stress and chronic inflammation. The aim of this study was to examine the association between leucocyte telomere length (LTL) with both the Dietary Inflammatory Index \u00ae 2014 (DII \u00ae ) and the Alternative Healthy Eating Index 2010 (AHEI-2010).

Women of reproductive age were asked about antenatal, delivery, and newborn care practices for their most recent live birth. Coverage of newborn feeding practices was estimated and multivariate regression was used to assess determinants of these practices. Seventy-six percent of live births were breastfed within 24 hours of birth, 84% were given colostrum, and 21% received prelacteals. Facility delivery and antenatal care attendance were associated with positive feeding practices. Positive newborn feeding practices were common in rural Burkina Faso, relative to other low-income settings. Interventions are needed to improve feeding practices among home-born babies, and to encourage earlier initiation of breastfeeding among facility-born newborns.",

    "abstract": "Bingeing is one pattern of high dose methamphetamine (METH) abuse which involves continuous drug taking over several days and can result in psychotic behaviors for which the brain pathology remains poorly-defined. A corresponding animal model of this type of METH exposure may provide novel insights into the neurochemical and behavioral sequelae associated with this condition. Accordingly, to simulate the pharmacokinetic profile of a human METH binge exposure in rats we used a computer-controlled, intravenous METH procedure (dynamic infusion) to overcome species differences in METH pharmacokinetics and to replicate the human 12-h plasma METH half-life. Animals were treated over 13 weeks with escalating METH doses, using dynamic infusion, and then exposed to a binge in which drug was administered every 3 h for 72h. Throughout the binge, behavioral effects included unabated intense oral stereotypies in the absence of locomotion and in the absence of sleep. Decrements in regional brain dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin levels, measured at 1 and 10 h after the last injection of the binge, had, with the exception of caudate-putamen dopamine and frontal cortex serotonin, recovered by 48 h. At 10 h after the last injection of the binge, [ 3 H]ligand binding to dopamine and vesicular monoamine transporters in caudate-putamen were reduced by 35% and 13%, respectively. In a separate METH binge treated cohort, post-binge behavioral alterations were apparent in an attenuated locomotor response to a METH challenge infusion at 24h after the last injection of the binge. Collectively, the changes we characterized during and following a METH binge suggest that for humans under similar exposure conditions, multiple time-dependent neurochemical deficits contribute to their behavioral profiles.",

    "abstract": "The rotation of the Earth around its own axis creates daily changes in the environment for virtually all living organisms. To anticipate and adapt to those changes, mammals possess an evolutionarily conserved circadian clock that controls most aspects of physiology. Using a previously undescribed analysis tool, we studied the impact of the circadian clock and its underlying feeding rhythms on hepatic gene expression. Our analysis shows that the loss of feeding rhythms in clock-disrupted animals is an important component of their phenotype. Finally, we were able to decipher the specific role of feeding rhythms, the circadian clock, and its controlled output of PARbZip transcription factors in the regulation of liver rhythmic gene expression. The circadian clock and feeding rhythms are both important regulators of rhythmic gene expression in the liver. To further dissect the respective contributions of feeding and the clock, we analyzed differential rhythmicity of liver tissue samples across several conditions. We developed a statistical method tailored to compare rhythmic liver messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in mouse knockout models of multiple clock genes, as well as PARbZip output transcription factors ( Hlf / Dbp / Tef ). Mice were exposed to ad libitum or night-restricted feeding under regular light\u2013dark cycles. During ad libitum feeding, genetic ablation of the core clock attenuated rhythmic-feeding patterns, which could be restored by the night-restricted feeding regimen. High-amplitude mRNA expression rhythms in wild-type livers were driven by the circadian clock, but rhythmic feeding also contributed to rhythmic gene expression, albeit with significantly lower amplitudes. We observed that Bmal1 and Cry1 / 2 knockouts differed in their residual rhythmic gene expression. Differences in mean expression levels between wild types and knockouts correlated with rhythmic gene expression in wild type. Surprisingly, in PARbZip knockout mice, the mean expression levels of PARbZip targets were more strongly impacted than their rhythms, potentially due to the rhythmic activity of the D-box\u2013repressor NFIL3. Genes that lost rhythmicity in PARbZip knockouts were identified to be indirect targets. Our findings provide insights into the diurnal transcriptome in mouse liver as we identified the differential contributions of several core clock regulators. In addition, we gained more insights on the specific effects of the feeding\u2013fasting cycle.",

    "abstract": "Short-term interruption of feeding is ordinary in modern life but negatively impacts appetite control and body weight. Estradiol (E) imposes long-term inhibitory tonus on food consumption; however, E influence on energy repletion secondary to food deprivation (FD) is unclear. This study investigated the hypothesis that E signal strength regulates hyperphagic responses to FD of varying duration. Ovariectomized female rats were implanted with E-containing silastic capsules (30 [E-30] or 300 \u00b5g [E-300]/mL) to replicate plasma concentrations at cycle nadir versus peak levels. Data show that food intake was increased equally in E-30 and E-300 rats after 12 hours of food deprivation (FD-12); yet, FD of 18 hours (FD-18) amplified refeeding by E-300 versus E-30. Caudal fourth ventricular administration of the 5\u2032-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor compound C (Cc) did not modify FD-induced hyperphagia in E-30 (regardless of FD interval) or E-300 animals exposed to FD-12, but diminished refeeding after FD-18 in E-300 rats. Cc-reversible hyperglycemia occurred in refed FD-18 groups. Serum insulin was resistant to FD-12 plus refeeding, but was elevated by AMPK-dependent mechanisms in refed E-300 FD-18 rats; equivalent Cc-insensitive decrements in circulating leptin occurred in all FD groups. Current results show that estrous cycle peak, but not baseline, E levels engage hindbrain AMPK signaling to intensify hyperphagia in response to prolongation of FD. Observations of hindbrain AMPK-dependent hyperglycemia, alongside elevated insulin secretion, in refed rats exposed to FD-18 implicate this sensor in insulin resistance mechanisms of glucose partitioning in response to this metabolic imbalance.",

One of the treatments to help this issue is acupressure. Therefore, the present study was designed to determine the effect of acupressure on maternal milk volume. This study is a randomized clinical trial in which 60 breastfeeding mothers complaining of hypogalactia and meeting the inclusion criteria were studied. In addition to providing routine education, bilateral acupressure was performed for 12 consequentia l days on the acupoints of SI1, LI4, and GB21 in the intervention group, as three sessions per week with each session conducted 2-5 times. The control group received only routine education. In both groups, breast milk volume before intervention and 2 and 4 weeks after intervention was evaluated by an electric pump. Data were analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistical analysis through SPSS. The t -test showed no significant difference in the mean volume of milk in the two groups ( P = 0.543). Mean volumes of milk before and 2 and 4 weeks after the intervention were 10.5 (8.3), 33 (13.44), and 36.2 (12.8), respectively, in the acupressure group and 9.5 (7.7), 17.7 (9.4), 18 (9.5), respectively, in the control group. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) test showed a significant difference in the mean volume of milk at 2 and 4 weeks after the intervention ( P < 0.001). Both acupressure and general education methods were effective on the milk volume of breastfeeding mothers. Acupressure method was more effective than the other method. Therefore, application of acupressure as a method of alternative medicine to increase breastfeeding is suggested.",

    "abstract": "Night eating syndrome (NES) was first identified in 1955 by Stunkard, a psychiatrist specialising in eating disorders (ED). Over the last 20 years considerable progress has been made in defining NES as a significant clinical entity in its own right and it has now been accepted for inclusion in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) due for publication in 2013. NES is considered a dysfunction of circadian rhythm with a disassociation between eating and sleeping. Core criteria include a daily pattern of eating with a significantly increased intake in the evening and/or night time, as manifested by one or both of the following: at least 25% of food intake is consumed after the evening meal or at least two episodes of nocturnal eating per week. An important recent addition to core criteria includes the presence of significant distress and/or impairment in functioning. Stunkard's team recommend further investigation on the pathogenesis of NES, in particular its relationship with traumatic life events, psychiatric comorbidity, the age of onset of NES and course of NES over time. The relationship between NES and other ED also requires further clarification as night-eaters exhibit some features of other ED; previous guidance to separate NES from other ED may have hindered earlier characterisation of NES. Evidence from European and American studies suggests NES features strongly in populations with severe obesity. The complex interplay between depression, impaired sleep and obesity-related comorbidity in severely obese individuals makes understanding NES in this context even more difficult. This review examines evidence to date on the characterisation of NES and concludes by examining the applicability of current NES criteria to individuals with severe obesity.",

The aim of the study was to investigate the effectivity and safety of totally endoscopic cardiac surgery without robotic assistance for atrial septal defect (ASD) closure on beating hearts. Twenty-five patients (adults/children: 15/10) underwent ASD closure using nonrobotically assisted totally endoscopic approach on beating heart. Three 5-mm trocars and one 12-mm trocar were used, only the superior vena cava is snared, filling the pleural and pericardial cavities with CO 2 , and the heart was beating during the surgery. Twenty-three patients had isolated secundum ASD (2 of which had severe tricuspid regurgitation) and two patients had ASD combined with partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection. All ASDs were closed using artificial patch, continuous suture; tricuspid regurgitations were repaired and the anomalous pulmonary veins were drained to the left atrium. No postoperative complications or deaths occurred. Mean \u00b1 SD operation time and mean cardiopulmonary bypass time were 267.2 \u00b1 44.6 and 156.1 \u00b1 33.6 min, respectively. These patients were extubated within the first 5 hours, and the volume of blood drainage on the first day was less than 80 mL. Four days after surgery, patients did not need analgesics and were able to return to normal activities 1 week postoperatively. Totally endoscopic operation for ASD closure on beating heart is safe, with short recovery period, and surgical scars are of high cosmetic value, especially in a woman and girl.",

The GI microbiome is essentially a microbial organ that provides metabolic, immunologic, and protective functions for the host. Habitual diet, changes in macronutrient composition, and consumption of nondigestible dietary fibers have all been shown to impact the human GI microbiome. Intriguingly, the impact of diet on the microbiome may be related not only to what humans eat but also to the timing of food consumption. Emerging preclinical research suggests that gut microbes experience diurnal rhythms, and the health effects of eating patterns, including time-restricted feeding and meal frequency, may be related to the GI microbiome. Herein, the complex connections among circadian rhythms, eating behaviors, the GI microbiome, and health are reviewed, highlighting the need for additional translational research in this area.",

In this analytic cross-sectional study, 280 mothers working in PHC, who were conveniently selected, answered a self-administered questionnaire to evaluate the barriers in continuing breastfeeding. In the study, 69.5% ( P = 0.006) of these respondents reported that an early return to work was the most common barrier that prevented continued EBF, followed by 66% ( P = 0.009) who responded that an unsupportive working environment had prevented them from exclusively breastfeeding. Inadequate breast milk from the mother is an obstacle identified by 43.5% of the study participants ( P < 0.001), and about 42.5% ( P < .001) of the mothers in the survey stated that breastfeeding takes a lot of time from the mother's daily routine, so the time constraints are an obstacle to continued EBF. In addition, 96% of the study participants reported that working environments in the field of PHC did not contain suitable places to breastfeed or pump breast milk; 77.5% of responses stated there were also no facilities for storage of milk expressed during working hours. A working mother could not benefit from breastfeeding breaks during the workday in 96.5% of the cases studied, and 60% of the women attributed the reason to the existence of a strict work schedule within the work environment. Nearly half of PHC working mothers in Al-Ahsa were exclusively breastfed their infants. Early return to work, deficient breastfeeding work support, insufficient breast milk and lack of time were the major barriers to EBF. Lack of nursing breaks, lactation places, and expressed milk storing facilities inside PHCCs are the major work-related barriers to continuity of EBF.",

This study focused on combined binge drinking and cannabis use in college students. Cannabis use and binge drinking had an additive effect on cognition. This consumption pattern contributed to memory and executive impairments. Binge drinkers had a heterogeneous cognitive profile regardless of cannabis use. Cannabis use should be assessed in binge drinkers to adapt prevention strategies. Binge drinking (BD) and cannabis use are prevalent in European adolescents and students. BD has been shown to have a negative impact on neuropsychological functioning, but little is known about the additive effect when it is combined with cannabis consumption. We therefore investigated the neuropsychological profiles of students who engage in combined BD and cannabis use, in order to explore the potentially harmful additive effects of cannabis use and BD on cognition. A sample of college students ( N =\u00a0298) completed questionnaires on alcohol and cannabis use, and were screened for neuropsychological impairments using the Brief Evaluation of Alcohol-Related Neuropsychological Impairments (BEARNI). First, after dividing students into three groups according to their alcohol and cannabis use (i.e., light drinkers, binge drinkers, and binge drinkers consuming cannabis), we ran a linear mixed model based on the BEARNI z scores to test the performances of the three groups. Information yielded by the mixed model was supplemented by individual analyses. Second, to explore the heterogeneity of binge drinkers\u2019 profiles, we ran a cluster analysis to characterize the alcohol users at higher risk of more severe neuropsychological impairment. Overall, poorer neuropsychological performances were observed among binge drinkers compared with light drinkers, whether they used cannabis or not. However, flexibility, episodic memory and working memory were particularly affected among binge drinkers who used cannabis. Results emphasize the importance of asking binge drinkers if they smoke cannabis, in order to adapt care and prevention strategies to their consumption and neuropsychological profile.",

Several experimental groups were                     defined for this 4-day study as well as for our previously reported 14-day study                     (Miyata et al ., 2009); these included 5-FU treated groups                     receiving 12, 15 and 18 mg/kg/day (FU12, FU15 and FU18), pair-feeding groups                     (R12, R15 and R18 receiving the same amount of food as the FU12, FU15 and FU18                     groups, respectively) and a nontreated control group. Although severe reductions                     in body weight gain and food consumption were reported in the 14-day study, only                     slight reductions were observed in the 4-day study. In the 4-day study, a                     decrease in blood reticulocytes and a decreasing trend of marrow erythroid cells                     were only observed in the FU18 group, and no effects were observed in the                     pair-feeding groups. The erythroblastic changes observed in this 4-day study                     were thought to reflect the direct influence of 5-FU administration. Since                     concerns regarding the influence of secondary changes related to undernutrition                     were minimized in the 4-day study, it was thought to clarify the direct                     influence of 5-FU administration on erythroblastic cells.

In an updated and extension of a previous meta-analysis, the goals of this study are to assess the short-term and long-term effectiveness of psychological and medical treatments for BED. We will search bibliographic databases and study registries, including manual searches for studies published before January 2016. The search strategy will include terms relating to binge eating and diverse forms of psychological and medical interventions. Language will be restricted to English. The studies included will be treatment studies, that is, randomised-controlled trials, and non-randomised and non-controlled studies, for individuals with BED (DSM-IV or DSM-5), and studies that provided a pre-treatment and at least one post-treatment or follow-up assessment of binge eating. The primary outcomes will be the number of binge-eating episodes, abstinence from binge eating and diagnosis of BED at post-treatment and/or follow-up(s), and changes from pre-treatment to post-treatment and/or follow-up(s). Likewise, as secondary outcomes, eating disorder and general psychopathology, quality of life, and body weight will be analysed and adverse events and treatment drop-out will be examined. Study search, selection and data extraction, including risk of bias assessment, will be independently performed by 2 reviewers and consensus will be sought. Moderator analyses will be conducted, and equity aspects will be considered. Sensitivity analyses will be conducted to determine the robustness of the results.

Extraction of data was conducted for study characteristics, provision of fluids or feeding in both groups and quality of studies was assessed using the Cochrane criteria. A random-effects model was applied to estimate the impact of these interventions across the spectrum of GDF severity. Restricted/ goal-directed intravenous fluid therapy is likely to reduce \u2018mild\u2019 GDF such as vomiting (p = 0.03) compared to a standard/ liberal intravenous fluid regime. Enterally fed patients experienced increased episodes of vomiting (p = <0.01) but were less likely to develop an anastomotic leak (p = 0.03) and peritonitis (p = 0.03) compared to parenterally fed patients. Vomiting (p = <0.01) and anastomotic leak (p = 0.04) were significantly lower in the early enteral feeding group. There is less emphasis on the combined approach of intravenous fluid resuscitation and enteral feeding in critically ill patients. Conservative fluid resuscitation and aggressive enteral feeding are presumably key factors contributing to severe life-threatening GDF. Future trials should evaluate the impact of cross-interaction between conservative and aggressive modes of these two interventions on the severity of GDF.",

Although there are multiple reports of ECoV outbreaks, less is known about the clinical presentation of individual horses during a nonoutbreak situation. The purpose of this study was to describe the clinical presentation of horses diagnosed with ECoV infection that were not associated with an outbreak. Medical records of all horses admitted to Washington State University, Veterinary Teaching Hospital, during an 8-year period were reviewed (2010\u20132018).

    "abstract": "People receiving cancer treatment are at nutritional risk. Their eating problems can lead to malnutrition and weight loss. Involuntary weight loss is also a defining characteristic of tumor-induced cachexia. Weight loss is associated with poor tolerance of treatment, poor treatment outcomes, morbidity, and mortality. Support for self-management of nutritional risk may protect against malnutrition and be important in multimodal therapies to arrest the progression of cachexia. Nurses can help patients by supporting self-management of eating problems. This scoping review is about eating problems during cancer treatment. It considers patient experience and self-management of eating problems during cancer treatment for the proactive management of malnutrition and cachexia. It draws on a systematic search of Medline, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Library for publications about people with cancer who have eating problems during treatment. Limits were English language; January 2000 to December 2017; adults. The search found studies about eating problems in patients treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy for head-and-neck cancer, lung cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, breast cancer, testicular cancer, and ovarian cancer. Nutritional counseling can improve nutritional intake, quality of life, and weight. However, the patient perspective on self-management and how to motivate engagement in nutritional care is unexplored. There is a potential for reducing nutritional risk during cancer treatment using psychoeducation to support behavioral change, thus empower self-management of eating problems. Benefits are likely in subgroups of people receiving cancer treatment, such as those with head and neck, gastrointestinal, and lung cancers.",

    "abstract": "Lamb has long been considered a traditional meal within Australia; however as consumer preferences have changed since the 1950\u2019s, consumption of lamb has decreased from the 1980\u2019s. This is the result of changing societal roles, particularly for females, decreasing household sizes and increasing awareness of the impact of food choices on human health. Since the 1980\u2019s improvement of farm practices and increases in genetic gains has addressed part of this decline by increasing the amount of lean meat and decreasing fat in lamb retail cuts. Yet, this has created a challenge for the industry to utilise the larger carcases now being produced. Thus, a whole value chain approach to increasing consumption has been undertaken through several research programs to create cuts which suit the modern consumer, examine nutritional and eating quality and increase adoption of value added cuts. Therefore, this paper outlines this history of changing consumer patterns and the consequent research to address these changes.",

    "abstract": "Primates along with many other animal taxa are forced to cope with large shifts in basic ecological conditions because of rapid anthropogenically induced changes of their habitats. One of the coping strategies for primates is to adjust their diet to these changes, and several studies have demonstrated the importance of fallback resources for this. Bonobos, like chimpanzees, might be particularly vulnerable to habitat fragmentation because of their high dependence on fruit availability. Little is known, however, about bonobo feeding ecology in fragmented habitats and their use of fallback resources. In this study, we investigate diet seasonal variation and the exploitation of preferred and fallback foods in a bonobo population living in forest\u2010savannah mosaics. Results show that bonobos have adapted to this fragmented habitat by feeding on only a few fruit species, including an important number of non\u2010tree species (liana, herb and savannah shrub), in comparison to populations living in dense forests. These non\u2010tree plants have been defined as fallback and non\u2010preferred foods, which are most probably consumed to maintain high frugivory. Interestingly, we identified that preferred foods are all typical of mature forests while fallback resources are mainly found in forest edges or disturbed areas. This finding indicates that bonobos prefer to use mature forests when feeding, as they do for nesting, but extend their range use to forest areas in close proximity to humans when the availability of preferred fruits is low. Finally, we show that bonobo diet relies heavily on two abundant fallback fruits: Musanga cecropioides and Marantochloa leucantha . Other studies have demonstrated that the selection of abundant fallback resources enables primates to subsist at high densities and to maintain cohesive groups, as observed at this study site. Our findings suggest that bonobos living in forest\u2010savannah mosaics can be considered as staple fallback food consumers. Am. J.

Presently, we provide a short review that develops an equally compelling case for the importance of dysregulated frontal cortical cognitive neural networks acting in concert with regional reward systems in the regulation of complex eating behaviors and in the presentation of complex pathophysiological symptoms associated with major eating disorders. Our goal is to highlight working models of major eating disorders that incorporate complementary approaches to elucidate functionally interactive neural circuits defined by their regulatory neurochemical phenotypes. Importantly, we also review evidence-based linkages between widely studied psychiatric and neurodegenerative syndromes (e.g., autism spectrum disorders and Parkinson\u2019s disease) and co-morbid eating disorders to elucidate basic mechanisms involving dopaminergic transmission and its regulation by endogenously expressed morphine in these same cortical regions.",

This qualitative study explores the impact of COVID-19 and associated public health measures on adults with eating disorders within the UK. We conducted 10 in depth interviews with adults (24\u201338 years) with a self-reported eating disorder during lockdown. Data were analysed using an inductive thematic analysis approach. We identified core themes related to social restrictions (social isolation, changes in accountability to others, and increased responsibility for self and others), functional restrictions (lack of routine and structure, a need to intentionally plan activity, a desire for secrecy particularly around food shopping) and restrictions in access to mental health services. Overall, the impact of the lockdown was experienced as a catalyst for either increased disordered eating behaviours or for a drive for recovery, depending on individual circumstances going into these restrictions. This study is the first in depth interview approach with adults with mixed eating disorder presentations in the UK during COVID-19.

Overlap between pregnancy and lactation could be associated with an increased risk for the pregnant mother, her fetus as well as her nursing child. The current study aims to compare the maternal and perinatal outcome of pregnancies occurred during lactation with those occurred after weaning in women with substandard nutrition. A prospective-cohort study was carried out in six Maternal and Child Health Centers in Assiut-Egypt. Estimated sample size was 540 women divided equally into two groups; the first included women who got pregnant during breastfeeding (PDBF), while the second included women who got pregnant after weaning (PAW). Tools were consisted of structured interview questionnaire including personal history, obstetrical data, breastfeeding, family planning histories and dietary intake during pregnancy. Pregnant women had been followed up to delivery to assess different maternal and fetal outcomes. Miscarriage rate was not statistically significant between both groups (2.2% in PDBF and 0.4% in PAW, p = 0.284). Women in PDBF group had higher prevalence of maternal anemia (54.1% versus 30.7%), intrauterine growth restriction (16.7% versus 4.8%), cesarean delivery (43.7% versus 31.5%), prolonged labor (13.3% versus 11.1%) and low birth weight infants (15.7% versus 8.8%) compared to women in PAW group. Pregnancy during breastfeeding is associated with an increase in the overall complications of pregnancy as compared to PAW. Although it does not increase the miscarriage rate, it increases the prevalence of maternal anemia, delayed fetal growth, prolonged labor, cesarean section delivery and the prevalence of low birth weight infants.",

The onset mechanism involves intracellular transport of phosphorus, potassium, and water, in association with rapid glucose administration. The resulting hypophosphatemia is extremely dangerous and can cause severe heart failure and fatal arrhythmia. We successfully used extracorporeal cardiopulmonary support to manage a case of refeeding syndrome that occurred during the course of treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. There are only a few reports of the use of cardiopulmonary support for the treatment of refeeding syndrome. A 72-year-old man was admitted to the hospital for treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. Despite receiving insulin and nutrition therapy, QT prolongation and ventricular fibrillation appeared on the electrocardiogram. Although coronary angiography was performed in consideration of the possibility of ischemic heart disease, no significant stenosis of the coronary arteries was identified. Due to persistent hypotension and recurrence of ventricular fibrillation, extracorporeal cardiopulmonary support was commenced in the ICU. His serum phosphorus level showed a marked decrease on his first day in the ICU, for which daily replacement therapy was administered during his ICU stay. No fatal arrhythmia developed thereafter. He was weaned off extracorporeal cardio-pulmonary support on the fourth day of his ICU stay and was subsequently discharged from the hospital. We suggest vigilant monitoring of electrolytes, including phosphate levels, in diabetic ketoacidosis patients, and active circulatory support, as required, in patients with refeeding syndrome.",

Risks related to NES are obesity, binge eating disorder, bulimia nervosa, affective disorders, and sleep disorders. The objective of this study is to analyze eating habits in terms of the risk assessment of NES occurrence in the population of women in the Masovian Voivodeship (in Poland). Six hundred and eleven women living in the Masovian Voivodeship participated in the study. The average age of the respondents was 22.7 years (median = 23.0; interquartile range = 3.0). The Night Eating Questionnaire (NEQ) was used to assess the risk of NES. In the studied group of women, 1.3% of cases (N = 12) reached a NEQ total score of \u226525, which indicates a probability of 40.7% for NES, while 0.7% (N = 4) reached a score of \u226530, which indicates a probability of 72.2% for occurrence of this syndrome. The highest average total score was observed in the group of obese people. The level of education of the participants did not significantly affect the NEQ score. A weak correlation was observed between the place of residence variable and the mood/sleep subscale ( r = 0.11, P < 0.01). NES may be one of the causes of overweight and obesity; therefore, the need for further studies on this health issue is justified. It is worth pointing out that knowing the conditions responsible for the occurrence of NES, it is possible to suggest a prevention procedure for this condition.",

We also demonstrate hot-vapor filtration during fast pyrolysis to remove fine char particles and inorganic contaminants from bio-oil. Representative results showed successful conversion of biomass feedstocks to fuel-range hydrocarbon biofuels and, specifically, the effect of hot-vapor filtration on bio-oil production and upgrading. The protocols provided in this report could help to generate rigorous and reliable data for biomass pyrolysis and bio-oil hydrotreating research.",

Male patients were 66.5%, with a mean (SD) age of 65.2 (10.0) years, 79.9% were PS 0\u20131, and the tumour stage was mainly IIIB\u2010IV (87.3%). Overall, 38.7% of patients had CAX, 33.8% pre\u2010CAX, and 0.9% refractory CAX. Molecular tumour profiles were significantly associated with the presence of CAX: 23.9% in EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF, or HER2+ patients, 41.4% in K\u2010RAS+, and 43.2% in patients with no molecular abnormality ( P =\u00a00.003). The more advanced the CAX stage, the poorer the scores of functional items of the QoL ( P <\u00a00.001) and International Physical Activity Questionnaire ( P <\u00a00.001). Sarcopenia was present in 66.7% of CAX and 68.5% of pre\u2010CAX patients. Overall, 43.8% of pre\u2010CAX patients had only sarcopenia with limited weight loss (\u22642%) and no anorexia. This is the first study to show the distribution of CAX in a population of NSCLC patients and an association between molecular abnormality in NSCLC and CAX. The original Fearon classification for CAX stages was supported by the associated functional QoL scores and physical activity levels, resulting in a clinically relevant system for detection of early stages of CAX.",

    "abstract": "An essential component of all mosquito-rearing activities is the act of blood-feeding the mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae). Many options exist for this purpose including live host animals and a diverse array of artificial-feeding methods. Most of the published artificial-feeding methods involve expensive materials, custom-built devices, or are labor-intensive. All of the previously published methods utilize blood sources, which are either expensive, or difficult to obtain. Additionally, much of the research into artificial blood-feeding methods for mosquitoes has focused on two species: Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse). This article presents a modified artificial blood-feeding method that uses affordable and easily sourced materials, does not require any technical knowledge to assemble, and requires minimal time and effort. The combination of inexpensive aluminum plates, Parafilm and polytetrafluoroethylene tape membranes, an electric germination mat, and frozen, food-grade blood produces exceptional feeding rates and abundant egg production. The method has been used for 2 yr at the Lee County Mosquito Control District to successfully maintain laboratory colonies of four species of mosquito: Ae. aegypti , Ae. albopictus , Aedes taeniorhynchus (Wiedemann), and Culex quinquefasciatus (Say). Variations of this method are reported, which can be used for wild and laboratory colonies of multiple species. This modified method is highly accessible for any small-scale mosquito rearing facility with labor or budgetary constraints.",

    "abstract": "Equine research and management is limited to single-housing systems if individual animal intake is to be precisely recorded. Even then, dry forage intake is difficult to quantify accurately due to stomping or mixing hay with fecal matter and bedding. In cattle management, GrowSafe Systems (GrowSafe) is a commonly used tool to closely monitor individual animal feeding data using radio frequency identification (RFID) tag technology. Animals are equipped with a unique RFID tag that is read by the feed bunks each time the animal lowers its head into the bunk to consume feed. The objectives of this pilot study were 1) to test the feasibility of use of the GrowSafe system with horses by measuring intake of dry hay and 2) to characterize feeding behaviors of horses in an individually housed (without competition) or group-housed (with competition) setting. To test the hypothesis that horses would consume more hay when individually (NOCOMP) compared to group-housed (COMP), 10 mature Quarter Horses (14 \u00b1 1.5 yr) were placed in one of four pens containing GrowSafe feed bunks in a 4-wk crossover design consisting of two 2-wk treatment periods. Pen 1 contained five horses with access to two GrowSafe bunks (Period 1: n = 4 mares, n = 1 gelding; Period 2: n = 5 geldings); pens 2, 3, and 4 contained one horse each with access to one bunk. Horses were individually fed 0.25% body weight (BW; dry matter [DM] basis) of a commercial concentrate once per day and were allowed Coastal bermudagrass hay in the GrowSafe bunks ad libitum. Although five horses were used in the group-housed (COMP) pen to more closely mimic a true group environment, only data from horses that experienced both housing systems ( n = 3 mares and n = 3 geldings) were used for statistical analyses. Hourly ( P = 0.008) and daily ( P = 0.003) durations of hay feeding were higher for NOCOMP compared to COMP horses, and total daily intake (g DM/kg BW) of NOCOMP horses tended to be greater ( P = 0.09) than COMP horses. Conversely, eating rate (g DM/kg BW/min) was greater ( P = 0.04) for COMP compared to NOCOMP mares but was unaffected by housing in geldings. The GrowSafe system may provide an opportunity for efficient and effective monitoring of individual horse feed intake and feeding behavior in group-housing situations in horses.",

A quasi-experimental design was used to obtain data regarding the nutritional status of 109 children who participated in the project from 6 rural areas. The NFCPP was conducted for 9 weeks, comprising 2 weeks of preintervention, 6 weeks of intervention, and one week of postintervention. The LFCF intervention consisted of 12 sets of recipes to be made by mothers and given to their children 4 times daily over 6 weeks. The weight-for-age z score (WAZ), height-for-age z score (HAZ), weight-for-height z score (WHZ), and body mass index-for-age z score (BAZ) were calculated using World Health Organization Anthro Plus version 1.0.3. LFCF intervention significantly increased WHZ, WAZ, and BAZ scores but decreased HAZ scores ( P <0.001). Average scores of WHZ (0.96\u00b10.97) and WAZ (0.45\u00b10.72) increased; BAZ increased (1.12\u00b10.93) after 6 weeks of LFCF. WAZ scores postintervention were 50.5% of normal, and WHZ scores were 77.1% of normal. However, the HAZ score decreased by 0.53\u00b10.52, which indicated 57.8% had short stature. The NFCPP program with LFCF intervention can improve the nutritional status of children in rural areas. It should be implemented as a sustained program for better provision of complementary feeding during the period of lactation using local food made available at community health centers.",

    "abstract": "Adequate nutrition is extremely crucial for the growth and development of preterm, small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants owing to an increased risk of postnatal growth failure and poor neurodevelopmental outcome. Despite the beneficial properties of human milk (HM), it should be fortified to prevent extrauterine growth restriction; however, fortification of HM with a bovine-based human milk fortifier (BHMF) may induce feeding intolerance (FI) and necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm newborns. Herein, we have described the nutritional management of a preterm SGA newborn with intolerance to BHMF. A male infant was born at a gestational age of 32 weeks and 5 days, SGA weighing 1,490 grams (< 10th percentile). During BHMF use, he presented with symptoms of FI including abdominal distention, increased gastric residuals, and delayed enteral feeding advancement. Therefore, HM was fortified with carbohydrate powder, whey protein powder, and medium-chain triglycerides oil instead of BHMF to prevent FI and promote weight gain. Caloric density of feeds was increased once every 3 or 4 days by approximately 5 kcal/kg/day until an intake of 100 kcal/kg/day was achieved. Subsequently, his caloric and protein intake increased, growth rate improved, and full enteral feeding was achieved without any further symptom of FI. In conclusion, the symptoms of FI with BHMF in a preterm SGA neonate improved with the administration of a macronutrient fortified HM without compromising his enteral feed advancements, growth rate, and energy or protein intake.",

    "abstract": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is a central mediator of a number of important pathologies such as the systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Administration of high TNF doses induces acute anorexia, metabolic derangement, inflammation, and eventually shock and death. The in vivo effects of TNF are largely mediated by a complex network of TNF-induced cytokines and hormones acting together or antagonistically. Since TNF also induces leptin, a hormone secreted by adipocytes that modulates food intake and metabolism, we questioned the role of leptin in TNF-induced pathology. To address this question, we tested mouse strains that were defective either in leptin gene ( ob/ob ) or in functional leptin receptor gene ( db/db ), and made use of a receptor antagonist of leptin. Ob/ob and db/db mice, as well as normal mice treated with antagonist, exhibited increased sensitivity to the lethal effect of TNF. Exogenous leptin afforded protection to TNF in ob/ob mice, but failed to enhance the protective effect of endogenous leptin in normal mice. We conclude that leptin is involved in the protective mechanisms that allow an organism to cope with the potentially autoaggressive effects of its immune system.",

    "abstract": " Introduction Osteoporosis is the most common metabolic bone disease characterized by low bone mass. Reproductive factors are known to affect bone mineral density (BMD). Calcium loss from maternal bone and decreased BMD have been observed especially during pregnancy and lactation, although this loss has been reported to recover within 6\u200a\u2013\u200a12 months. There is no consensus on whether the effect of reproductive factors on the bone is positive or negative. The adolescent period is important for total bone mass, and total bone mass is significant in osteoporosis. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of first gestational age, multiple births during adolescence, interpregnancy interval and reproductive history such as duration of breastfeeding on bone mineral density in postmenopausal women.  Materials and Methods BMD was measured in a total of 196 postmenopausal patients and in accordance with the results, analysis was made of three groups as normal, osteopenia and osteoporosis. Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) was used to take the lumbar, femoral and total bone BMD measurements.  Results No statistically significant difference was determined between the groups in respect of total breastfeeding time (p\u2009=\u20090.596). It was detected that an increased interpregnancy interval decreased the risk of osteoporosis. In patients with osteoporosis, the mean interpregnancy interval was 1.4\u2009\u00b1\u20090.73\u00a0years, while it was longer in patients with osteopenia (1.92\u2009\u00b1\u20091.20) and normal BMD (2.45\u2009\u00b1\u20091.77) (p\u2009=\u20090.005). While no effect was determined of the first gestational age on BMD, in the univariate logistic regression analysis, multiple births in the adolescent period were seen to increase the risk of osteoporosis 6.833-fold (p\u2009=\u20090.001, OR\u2009=\u20096.833, 95%\u2009CI\u2009=\u20092.131\u200a\u2013\u200a21.908; p\u2009=\u20090.001). The increase in the age of menopause was determined to decrease the risk of osteoporosis (OR\u2009=\u20090.911, 95%\u2009CI\u2009=\u20090.843\u200a\u2013\u200a0.985; p\u2009=\u20090.019).  Conclusion Having frequent births throughout the whole reproductive age and having more than one child in adolescence has an adverse effect on postmenopausal bone mineral densities.",

Therefore, we aimed to investigate if body shape difficulties\u2014with a focus on both body checking and avoidance\u2014could improve during hospitalization in both subtypes of AN and to ascertain eventual associations between body shape concerns upon admission and clinical outcome. Upon hospital admission and end of treatment (EOT), 139 inpatients with AN completed Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ), Body Checking Questionnaire (BCQ), and Body Image Avoidance Questionnaire (BIAQ) in addition to measures of eating and general psychopathology. Patients with severe AN reported improved BSQ and BIAQ scores at EOT while BCQ did not significantly change. Diagnostic subtypes differed only in baseline BSQ scores and had an impact on the improvement in BSQ at EOT. Baseline BCQ was associated with patients\u2019 clinical improvement at EOT, even after controlling for age, duration of illness, Body Mass Index, depression, and anxiety scores. Data on body shape concerns and their trajectory during hospitalization for severe AN are lacking; our findings provide support to the effectiveness of hospitalization in improving body shape concerns and body avoidance, but not body checking. Also, baseline body shape concerns (especially body checking) impacted on clinical improvement. Future research is needed to identify treatments that could further improve the therapeutic approach to severe patients of AN in the acute setting.",

The data were analyzed using the MINITAB \u00ae 12.21 (USA) statistical software. All the infants studied were still on breast milk. Most of the mothers demonstrated correct body positioning (89.9) and attachment (78.7%) during breastfeeding, and effective suckling was demonstrated in 77.0%. Interestingly, none of the infants was either exclusively breastfed for 6 months or currently on exclusive breastfeeding. Furthermore, only 64 (58.2%) of the 110 infants that were more than 6 months of age had appropriately been started on complementary feeding from 6 months of age. Overall, most caregivers (88.7%) had \u201cfair\u201d to \u201cgood\u201d infant feeding practices. The practices were significantly associated with their level of education, and their relationship with the infants. Up to 40.0% and 73.7% of the infants had varying degrees of wasting and stunting respectively. Infant feeding practices and the age of the infants emerged as the only factors significantly associated with stunting, while both the caregivers\u2019 practices and age of the infants emerged as significant predictors of wasting in the infants. Barely 3 years to the 2015 target of the millennium development goals (MDGs), infant feeding and nutritional status still poses a serious threat to the dream of realizing the MDG-4.

The results were compared with existing nutritional practice in which enteral feeding started, usually after 7 to 8 postoperative day (PODs) in our institute. Thirty patients whome underwent a PD from January 2016 to December 2016 were included in the study. They were divided into two groups, I and II. In group I (n=15), enteral feeding was started from the 2 nd POD through the nasojejunal feeding tube along with parenteral partial nutrition support. In group II (n=15), no enteral feeding was given up to seventh and eighth PODs, except the perenteral feeding. Post-operatively, serum albumin levels, total lymphocyte count, total bilirubin levels, serum alkaline phosphate levels were measured for two weeks postoperatively in all the patients for assessing nutritional, immunological and cholestasis status. The mortality, morbidity and lengths of post-operative hospital stay were also recorded. Postoperatively, the serum albumin level and lymphocyte count decreased from the pre-operative level on the third POD and it gradually increased from the seventh POD onwards in both groups. However, they remained persistently higher in group I than group II. The total bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase decreased to normal levels within the seventh POD in Group I. However, they remained higher than normal levels on POD 14 in Group II. The morbidity and hospital stay was significantly lower in group I than group II. Early enteral feeding should be considered after PD. This is because it will improve nutritional, immunological status and cholestasis. Therefore, it reduces morbidity and shortens the hospital stay.",

    "abstract": "The rate of adolescents presenting with anorexia nervosa (AN) is increasing. Medically unstable adolescents are admitted to the hospital for nutrition restoration. A lack of global consensus on appropriate refeeding practices of malnourished patients has resulted in inconsistent refeeding practices. Refeeding hypophosphatemia (RH) is the most common complication associated with refeeding the malnourished patient. This review sought to identify the range of refeeding rates adopted globally and the implication that total energy intake and malnutrition may have on RH while refeeding adolescents with anorexia nervosa. Studies were identified by a systematic electronic search of medical databases from 1980 to September 2012. Seventeen publications were identified, including 6 chart reviews, 1 observational study, and 10 case reports, with a total of 1039 subjects. The average refeeding energy intake was 1186 kcal/d, ranging from 125\u20131900 kcal/d, with a mean percentage median body mass index (% mBMI) of 78%. The average incidence rate of RH was 14%. A significant correlation between malnutrition (% mBMI) and post-refeeding phosphate was identified ( R  2 = 0.6, P = .01). This review highlights the disparity in refeeding rates adopted internationally in treating malnourished adolescents with anorexia nervosa. Based on this review, the severity of malnutrition seems to be a marker for the development of RH more so than total energy intake.",

    "abstract": "Rates of exclusive breastfeeding are slowly increasing, but remain suboptimal globally despite the health and economic benefits. This study estimates the costs of not breastfeeding across seven countries in Southeast Asia and presents a cost-benefit analysis of a modeled comprehensive breastfeeding strategy in Viet Nam, based on a large programme. There have been very few such studies previously for low- and middle-income countries. The estimates used published data on disease prevalence and breastfeeding patterns for the seven countries, supplemented by information on healthcare costs from representative institutions. Modelling of costs of not breastfeeding used estimated effects obtained from systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Modelling of cost-benefit for Viet Nam used programme data on costs combined with effects from a large-scale cluster randomized breastfeeding promotion intervention with controls. This study found that over 12 400 preventable child and maternal deaths per year in the seven countries could be attributed to inadequate breastfeeding. The economic benefits associated with potential improvements in cognition alone, through higher IQ and earnings, total $1.6 billion annually. The loss exceeds 0.5% of Gross National Income in the country with the lowest exclusive breastfeeding rate (Thailand). The potential savings in health care treatment costs ($0.3 billion annually) from reducing the incidence of diarrhoea and pneumonia could help offset the cost of breastfeeding promotion. Based on the data available and authors\u2019 assumptions, investing in a national breastfeeding promotion strategy in Viet Nam could result in preventing 200 child deaths per year and generate monetary benefits of US$2.39 for every US$1, or a 139% return on investment. These encouraging results suggest that there are feasible and affordable opportunities to accelerate progress towards achieving the Global Nutrition Target for exclusive breastfeeding by 2025.",

Classical psychometric methods evaluated factor structure, interrater and retest reliability, and validity in 4 prospective studies of 836 infants. Results . Interrater and retest reliability were acceptable to good. IGSQ Index score was highly correlated ( r = 0.89) with daily parent reports. IGSQ scores were significantly different between infants whose parents planned to switch formulas because of perceived feeding problems and those without parental concerns. Conclusions . The IGSQ is a practical, reliable, and valid method for assessment of infant gastrointestinal-related behaviors. Its use in clinical studies can provide empirical evidence to advance parent education regarding both normal and clinically meaningful feeding-related behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Thin children may have insufficient intake of energy and nutrients, resulting in reduced immune function and growth. This study aimed to identify the effects of multiple herb formula SEC-22 supplementation on growth, dietary changes, and picky eating behaviors in thin children. A double-blind, randomized clinical trial was conducted on 79 children aged 2-5 years with poor appetites, BMI percentile < 25, and without any illness. Subjects were given either SEC-22 (n = 35) or placebo (n = 44) for 2 months and followed for an additional 2 months. Three-day dietary records, questionnaires on picky eating behaviors, and anthropometric measures were collected. Energy, carbohydrate intake, and feeding difficulty improved in both groups during the intervention period. However, changes were maintained only in the SEC-22 group after 2 months of follow-up post-supplementation. 'Frequency of trying to feed' was improved in the SEC-22 group compared to the placebo group after the first month of follow-up ( P < 0.05). Intakes of potassium and thiamine were improved in the SEC-22 group compared to the placebo group after the first month of intervention ( P < 0.05). 'Frequency of food reward', eating amount, and intakes of carbohydrate, potassium, and vitamin C showed significant improvement compared to the placebo group after the second month of follow-up ( P < 0.05). These results suggest that SEC-22 supplementation can improve parental feeding difficulty resulting from insufficient eating amount or picky eating as well as increase nutrient intake in thin children. Although these improvements were observable at least 2 months after supplementation, effects beyond this time frame need to be confirmed.",

The fourth- and fifth-instar larvae fed on hybrid K47*K19 had the highest weight of food consumption and those reared on hybrid KSC705 had the lowest value of food consumption. The highest weight gain of the larvae was observed when H. armigera were fed hybrid KLM78*MO17 and lowest when they were fed hybrids K36 * MO17, KSC705, and K35 * K36. Pupal weight of H. armigera was heaviest when larvae were fed hybrid K47*K19 and lightest when they were fed hybrid KSC705. The highest proteolytic activity of the fourth-instar larvae was observed when they were fed hybrid KSC705, and the lowest activity was observed when they were fed hybrid K47*A67. Fifth-instar larvae that fed on hybrid K47*K19 showed the highest proteolytic activity. Fourth-instar larvae that fed on hybrid K36*MO17 showed the highest amylase activity. The fifth-instar larvae fed on hybrid K47*A67 showed the maximum amylase activity and those reared on the K48*K18 showed the minimum activity.

The objective of this study was to investigate the awareness of food nutritive value and eating practices among bank workers in Lagos State, Nigeria. The study adopted a cross-sectional descriptive survey design. A purposive sample of 250 bank workers took part in the study. Means and Student t tests were employed for data analysis. Results showed that bank workers were aware of the nutritive value of foods, and that eating practices commonly adopted included skipping breakfast, eating breakfast at work, buying food at work from the bank canteen, eating in between meals, buying snacks as lunch, and consuming soft drinks daily, among others. There were no significant differences between male and female bank workers in mean responses on food nutritive value or in eating practices adopted. Good eating habits will help bank workers not only to improve their nutritional well-being, but also to prevent nutrition-related diseases. The implications for nutritional counseling and education are discussed in the context of these findings.",

In a cross-sectional study, university students ( n =\u2009261) were recruited to explore the relationship of mindfulness, mindful eating and self-compassion with current weight and grazing. Results indicated that all constructs were negatively related to grazing, but only mindful eating related negatively to current weight.

We aimed to analyze the prevalence of oral Candida spp in individuals with ED. The sample of the study was comprised of 30 women with purgative habits and 15 without purgative habits. Samples of the oral cavity were collected by sterile cotton swab rubbed on soft tissues and teeth. Yeasts were isolated on Sabouraud dextrose agar. Yeasts were isolated from the oral cavity of 53% of the patients yielding 75 yeast isolates; of these, 43 were identified by conventional mycological methods: C. parapsilosis (n=19), C. glabrata (n=16), Rhodotorula sp (n= 6), C. famata (n=2). The remaining 32 isolates were presumptively identified as C. albicans or C. dubliniensis and required mass spectrometry for the final differentiation: 28 isolates were confirmed as C. albicans and four as C. dubliniensis . Among the control group, only four subjects (26.7%) were found to harbor C. albicans. The four C. dubliniensis isolates were from two patients, one that was only colonized and the other, with severe ED, was diagnosed with an oral candidiasis as demonstrated by the presence of pseudohyphae on the direct mycological exam from different sites. The increased rate of isolation of non- albicans species, such as C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis , and C. dubliniensis in the oral cavity from ED patients with nutritional deficiency may suggest that purgative habits of these patients can lead to changes in normal flora and predispose to oral candidiasis.",

Forty-nine responses were received (49/69, 71%). The rate of enteral feeding during TH and rewarming was 59% (29/49). There was a significant linear trend for the increase in the proportion of units starting enteral feeds (p=0.001) during TH. As compared with post-TH period, significantly lower milk volumes were started during TH (median (range): 7.5\u2009mL/kg/day (1.5\u201324) vs 17.5\u2009mL/kg/day (7.5\u201330), p=0.0004).

Only 29% (14/49) of units used PN, with 86% (12/14) of those offering enteral feeds during PN. Guidelines for feeding during TH were available in 31% (15/49) of units. Many neonatal clinicians offer enteral feeds predominantly using expressed breast milk, with or without PN, during TH, although with huge variability. The heterogeneity in the nutritional practice underscores the need for assessing the safety of both enteral and parenteral feeding during TH.",

Accumulating evidence supports a biopsychosocial model that includes genetic heritability, neurobiological vulnerability, and psychosocial factors, such as stress, in the development and maintenance of ED. Notably, stress hormones influence appetite and eating, and dysfunction of the physiological stress response has been implicated in ED pathophysiology. Stress signals also appear associated with food reward neurocircuitry response in ED, providing a possible mechanism for the role of stress in appetite dysregulation. This paper provides a review of some of the interacting psychological, behavioral, physiological, and neurobiological mechanisms involved in the stress response among individuals with ED, and discusses novel neuroimaging techniques to address potential physiological confounds of studying neural correlates of stress in ED, such as calibrated fMRI.",

Method: Two groups with obesity were evaluated, one without BED (OB, n =\u00a054) and the other with BED (OB-BED, n =\u00a048), using a social-demographic questionnaire as well as a semi-structured interview to assess BED, questionnaires (DASS-21, EDE-Q, EEQ) and the Repertory Grid Technique. Results: Overall, the OB-BED group presented more conflicts and more symptoms. The model that best differentiated between the groups included emotional eating and level of cognitive conflicts, correctly classifying 91.4% of the sample.

The women completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and a questionnaire collecting demographic and obstetric data. Data were described as proportions (percentages). Differences between proportions were assessed with chi-squared tests. To control for possible confounders, we fitted bivariate logistic regression models in which the dependent variable was an EPDS sum score of <10 versus a score of \u226510. We found a high prevalence of depressive symptoms. A total of 32 women (37.2%) had an EPDS score of \u226510, 16 (18.6%) had a score between 10 and 12, and 16 (18.6%) had a score of \u226513. In our sample, an EPDS score of \u226510 was significantly associated with multiparity (odds ratio [OR] =3.58; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.13\u201311.30; P =0.030), pregnancy complications (OR =3.40; 95% CI: 1.03\u201311.26; P =0.045), labor complications (OR =11.43; 95% CI: 1.71\u201376.61; P =0.012), cesarean section (OR =4.19; 95% CI: 1.10\u201316.01; P =0.036), and incomplete breast-feeding (OR =5.00; 95% CI: 1.42\u201317.54; P =0.012). Our results indicate that postpartum depression may be prevalent in Argentina, and may be associated with incomplete breast-feeding, cesarean section, perinatal complications and multiparity. The prevalence and risk factors for postpartum depression has not been described previously and is a considerable health-related problem among women. Argentinian health professionals should be aware of the high prevalence rate and possible risk factors so that these women and families can be identified and receive adequate support and treatment.",

The type, management, and care of feeding should be carried out properly. This is a prospective clinical study of enteral feeding on patients admitted to hospital with aspiration pneumonia. The known enteral nutritional methods, advantages, and disadvantages were told to the patient or proxy. If they didn\u2019t accept Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), nasojejunal tube (NJT) was advised. If they denied all of the procedures, oral feeding education was given. A total of 94 patients were enrolled to the study, 29 of them accepted PEG, 42 preferred NJT, and 23 preferred oral route. A total of 94 patients with a mean age of 77.84, standard deviation 10.784; 95% confidence interval (CI) 75.63-80.03 were enrolled to the study of which 27 (28.7%) patients had a history of aspiration pneumonia. Oral feeding was prominently preferred for patients nursed by a relative (15; 65.2% of Oral feeding group and 16% of total) or a caregiver (7; 30.4% of Oral feeding group and 7.4% of total) while only 1 (4.3% of Oral feeding group and 1.1% of total) with a health-care worker ( P = 0.001). Overall re-aspiration rates at the 6 th month were 58%, 78%, 91% in EG, NJT, oral groups, respectively. Sixth months\u2019 survival rates of the different feeding groups were not significantly divergent from each other. History of aspiration was also found to be a significant contributor of mortality.

Beyond its psychiatric significance, it is associated with multiple hematological features such as cytopenia. It can be related to gelatinous transformation of the bone marrow. We describe the case of a 20-year-old male admitted for rapid involuntarily weight loss. He presented with extreme bradycardia with a heart rate of 30 beats per minute with recent psychomotor impairment. Routine laboratory tests showed pancytopenia, and cytolysis on liver function tests. Cardiac investigations did not reveal abnormalities except for sinus bradycardia. Bone marrow aspirate revealed hypo-cellular marrow with infiltration by gelatinous substance. In addition, bone marrow biopsy showed fat cell atrophy along with loss of hematopoietic elements in areas of gelatinous transformation. During the patient\u2019s hospital stay, he had a restrictive oral diet. Thus, after consulting with a psychiatric specialist, a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa complicated with gelatinous transformation of bone marrow, bradycardia, and acute hepatitis was made. After psychiatric treatment and nutritional care, the patient regained weight, had a normal heart rate and normal liver function tests, and his full blood count and bone marrow examination were within normal range. Gelatinous transformation of bone marrow can be the revealing feature of anorexia nervosa and some potentially reversible associations might prove life threatening if misdiagnosed. Furthermore, lack of suspicion can lead to unwarranted investigations increasing the cost incurred in healthcare delivery. Our patient had 3 systems involved: cardiac, hepatic, and hematological systems. Gelatinous transformation of bone marrow, although a rare condition, must be considered in such patients.",

    "abstract": " Background: In several disease conditions, patients must inevitably be nourished by enteral feeding (EF). Though in many countries, commercial formulas are routinely used for EF, in Iran still home-made formulas are commonly employed as commercial formulas are not covered by insurance. This may pose patients to malnutrition and bring about further costs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of EF commercial formulas in comparison with home-made formulas and thus to make further evidence for insurance policy-making  Methods: Medline, Cochrane, Embass and Center for Review & Dissemination (CRD) as well as IranDoc and SID databases were searched. Keywords included formula, ICU, and enteral nutrition or tube feeding. No clinical trial study on the efficacy of EF formulas was found. Therefore, the compositions of available formulas and their cost-effectiveness were evaluated based on the clinical guidelines of scientific bodies such as American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ASPEN), European Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ESPEN) and relative articles available in PubMed. In addition, the expert opinions were also taken into consideration.  Results: Domestic commercial formulas seemed to less merit dietary recommended intakes, i.e. the amount of some nutrients were much higher, and some others were much lower than the recommended values. The amount of several micronutrients including vitamins B1, B6, C, D and K, as well as iron, calcium and magnesium were not sufficient to meet the body needs in most commercial formulas upon receiving 2000 kilocalories and less.  Conclusion: Clinical studies on the efficacy of commercial formulas in comparison with home-made formulas are needed. Meanwhile, making suitable conditions for increasing the diversity of artificial nutrition products in the market would help clinical nutritionists to make better choices according to their patients conditions and to reduce the costs, as well.",

The study included 300 NKRs (245 females and 55 males) who completed self-report questionnaires that assessed PTSD, experiences of imprisonment, and exposure to inhumane treatment, by authorities in North Korea. A moderation analysis was conducted using a hierarchical multiple regression model to determine whether a moderation effect existed. In the next step, a post-hoc probing procedure of the moderation effect was performed using multiple regression models that included conditional moderator variables. The influence of the frequency of being imprisoned on PTSD varied as a function of recurrent exposure to inhumane treatment or punishment by authorities. Experiences of imprisonment were associated with PTSD only among those who were exposed to recurrent violence, such as beating or torture, by North Korean authorities. The present findings highlight the significant effects of human rights violations, such as the inhumane treatment of prisoners in North Korea, on the PTSD of NKRs.",

    "abstract": "Most disease-modifying drugs (DMDs) are contraindicated in pregnancy. Management of MS is especially challenging for pregnant patients, as withdrawal of DMDs leave the patient at risk of increased disease activity. We, a group of experts in MS care from countries in the Arab Gulf, present our consensus recommendations on the management of MS in these patients. Where possible, a patient planning pregnancy can be switched to a DMD considered safe in this setting. Interferon \u03b2 now can be used during pregnancy, where there is a clinical need to maintain treatment, in addition to glatiramer acetate. Natalizumab (usually to 30\u00a0weeks\u2019 gestation for patients with high disease activity at high risk of relapse and disability progression) may also be continued into pregnancy. Cladribine tablets and alemtuzumab have been hypothesised to act as immune reconstitution therapies (IRTs). These drugs provide a period of prolonged freedom from relapses for many patients, but the patient must be prepared to wait for up to 20\u00a0months from initiation of therapy before becoming pregnant. If a patient becomes pregnant while taking fingolimod, and requires continued DMD treatment, a switch to interferon \u03b2 or natalizumab after a variable washout period may be prescribed, depending on the level of disease activity. Women who wish to breastfeed should be encouraged to do so, and interferon \u03b2 may also be used during breastfeeding. There is a lack of data regarding the safety of using other DMDs during breastfeeding.",

It is estimated that NHBD can increase the number of organs available for transplant by 25% at a time of great need. However, should NHBD be ethically acceptable? In support of NHBD, it may be acceptable practice if there is a separation of the rationale to withdraw life support/to withhold cardiopulmonary resuscitation from the decision to recover organs, if no conflicts of interest exist, if a waiting time precluding spontaneous return of circulation is included, and if NHBD conforms to a standardized protocol. Against NHBD, there are questions regarding the ambiguity and cultural perspectives of death, regarding whether a separation of rationale between withdrawal and donation is sufficient to preclude conflicts of interest, and regarding whether variable protocols arise that subordinate the patient to the goal of donation. Such concerns suggest NHBD may damage the trust in patient\u2013physician relationships and may adversely affect organ donation rates.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence, characteristics, and factors related to feeding problems among normal children, and the differences in feeding practices between those with and without feeding problems. Caregivers of 402 healthy children aged between one and four years of age were interviewed by pediatricians involved in the research. Data included the child\u2019s medical history, food intake within a day, and feeding behaviors and practices. Parental socio-economic and demographic information, as well as information on parental education and occupation, and their concerns about feeding their children, was collected. Physical examination and anthropometric measurements were taken. The percentage of children identified as having feeding problems was 26.9%. The first child of a family had an increased risk of having feeding problems [P=0.032, odds ratio 1.68, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) 1.04-2.71]. Children with feeding problems were fed less frequently, were less likely to be fed at their own table or at the family table, and had mealtimes longer than 30 min when compared with children without feeding problems (P=0.015, 0.004 and 0.025, respectively). The results highlight that feeding problems in normally developing children are common. During consultations about feeding issues, pediatricians should focus on families with a first child. Topics such as frequency of meals per day, duration of mealtimes, and appropriate places for feeding should be discussed.",

    "abstract": "Dietary proteins have potent eating-inhibitory and glucose-lowering effects, which may be mediated via effects of amino acids on gastrointestinal hormone and motor function, although little information is available. We have now evaluated the effects of L-phenylalanine (L-Phe) and L-glutamine (L-Gln) on antropyloroduodenal motility and plasma cholecystokinin (CCK) concentrations. Two double-blind, 3-way cross-over studies were performed, each including 10 healthy, normal-weight men. We determined the antropyloroduodenal motor and plasma CCK responses to 90-minute intraduodenal infusions of L-Phe (study A) or L-Gln (study B), each at 0.15 kcal/min (total 13.5 kcal), or 0.45 kcal/min (total 40.5 kcal), or saline (control), in randomized fashion. Intraduodenal L-Phe at 0.45 kcal/min, but not at 0.15 kcal/min, suppressed antral ( P < 0.01), and stimulated phasic ( P < 0.01), but not tonic, pyloric, or duodenal pressures, while L-Phe at both 0.15 kcal/min and 0.45 kcal/min stimulated plasma CCK. In contrast, L-Gln had no effect on antral, duodenal or pyloric pressures, or plasma CCK. Intraduodenal infusions of L-Phe and L-Gln, in doses of 0.15 kcal/min and 0.45 kcal/min for 90 minutes, have different effects on antropyloroduodenal motility and CCK in normal-weight men. The modulation of antral and pyloric pressures and CCK may contribute to the eating-inhibitory effects of oral L-Phe, possibly through the slowing of gastric emptying.",

However, prospective evidence of the combined effects of unhealthy eating and depressive symptoms has not been reported. This study aimed to elucidate the prospective relationship between habitual unhealthy eating habits and depressive symptoms. A 2-year prospective cohort study of 376 Japanese adults aged 24\u201383 years without depressive symptoms at baseline was conducted. Information about participants' eating behaviors was obtained via a self-administered questionnaire, in which skipping breakfast, eating dinner shortly before bedtime, and snacking after dinner were recorded. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Japanese version of the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale. The 2-year incidence of depressive symptoms was found to be 23.7% (89/376). Covariate-adjusted multivariate Poisson regression analyses showed that habitual snacking after dinner was significantly associated with the incidence of depressive symptoms (relative risk [RR] 1.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00\u20133.14, p = 0.049), whereas no relationship was found between skipping breakfast or eating dinner shortly before bedtime and depressive symptoms. On the other hand, there was an interaction effect of snacking after dinner and dinner before bedtime on depressive symptoms ( p for the interaction = 0.044). Participants with more than two unhealthy eating behaviors had a higher incidence of depressive symptoms compared to those with fewer than two unhealthy eating behaviors (RR 1.71; 95% CI, 1.06\u20132.77, p = 0.028).

We identified a reproducible cortical and subcortical brain structural covariation pattern. A novel pattern discovery method Joint and Individual Variance Explained (JIVE) was used. The cortical and subcortical structural covariation pattern is related to alcohol use initiation. The identified pattern is dominated by covariation among brainstem, thalamus and PFC. A thalamic-PFC-brainstem circuitry might be related to alcohol use initiation. Binge drinking and age at first full drink (AFD) of alcohol prior to 21\u00a0years (AFD\u00a0<\u00a021) have been linked to neuroanatomical differences in cortical and subcortical grey matter (GM) volume, cortical thickness, and surface area. Despite the importance of understanding network-level relationships, structural covariation patterns among these morphological measures have yet to be examined in relation to binge drinking and AFD\u00a0<\u00a021. Here, we used the Joint and Individual Variance Explained (JIVE) method to characterize structural covariation patterns common across and specific to morphological measures in 293 participants (149 individuals with past-12-month binge drinking and 144 healthy controls) from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). An independent dataset (Nathan Kline Institute Rockland Sample; NKI-RS) was used to examine reproducibility/generalizability. We identified a reproducible joint component dominated by structural covariation between GM volume in the brainstem and thalamus proper, and GM volume and surface area in prefrontal cortical regions. Using linear mixed regression models, we found that participants with AFD\u00a0<\u00a021 showed lower joint component scores in both the HCP (beta\u00a0=\u00a00.059, p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.016; Cohen\u2019s d\u00a0=\u00a00.441) and NKI-RS (beta\u00a0=\u00a00.023, p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.040, Cohen\u2019s d\u00a0=\u00a00.216) datasets, whereas the individual thickness component associated with binge drinking (p-value\u00a0=\u00a00.02) and AFD\u00a0<\u00a021 (p-value\u00a0<\u00a00.001) in the HCP dataset was not statistically significant in the NKI-RS sample. Our findings were also generalizable to the HCP full sample (n\u00a0=\u00a0880 participants). Taken together, our results show that use of JIVE analysis in high-dimensional, large-scale, psychiatry-related datasets led to discovery of a reproducible cortical and subcortical structural covariation pattern involving brain regions relevant to thalamic-PFC-brainstem neural circuitry which is related to AFD\u00a0<\u00a021 and suggests a possible extension of existing addiction neurocircuitry in humans.",

    "abstract": "Cigarette smoking (CS) is the most common method of consuming tobacco. Deleterious effects on bone integrity, increased incidence of fractures, and delayed fracture healing are all associated with CS. Over 150 of the 6500 molecular species contained in cigarette smoke and identified as toxic compounds are inhaled by CS and, via the bloodstream, reach the skeletal system. New technologies designed to develop a reduced-risk alternative for smokers are based on electronic nicotine delivery systems, such as e-cigarettes and tobacco heating systems (THS). THS are designed to heat tobacco instead of burning it, thereby reducing the levels of harmful toxic compounds released. To examine the effects of THS on osteoprogenitor cell viability and function compared to conventional CS. Human immortalized mesenchymal stem cells ( n = 3) and primary human pre-osteoblasts isolated from cancellous bone samples from BG Unfall Klinik T\u00fcbingen ( n = 5) were osteogenically differentiated in vitro with aqueous extracts generated from either the THS 2.4 \u201cIQOS\u201d or conventional \u201cMarlboro\u201d cigarettes for up to 21 d. Cell viability was analyzed using resazurin conversion assay (mitochondrial activity) and calcein-AM staining (esterase activity). Osteogenic differentiation and bone cell function were evaluated using alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity, while matrix formation was analyzed through alizarin red staining. Primary cilia structure was examined by acetylated \u03b1-tubulin immunofluorescent staining. Free radical production was evaluated with 2\u2019,7\u2019-dichlorofluorescein-diacetate assay. Our data clearly show that THS is significantly less toxic to bone cells than CS when analyzed by mitochondrial and esterase activity ( P < 0.001). No significant differences in cytotoxicity between the diverse flavors of THS were observed. Harmful effects from THS on bone cell function were observed only at very high, non-physiological concentrations. In contrast, extracts from conventional cigarettes significantly reduced the AP activity (by two-fold) and matrix mineralization (four-fold) at low concentrations. Additionally, morphologic analysis of primary cilia revealed no significant changes in the length of the organelle involved in osteogenesis of osteoprogenitor cells, nor in the number of ciliated cells following THS treatment. Assessment of free radical production demonstrated that THS induced significantly less oxidative stress than conventional CS in osteoprogenitor cells. THS was significantly less harmful to osteoprogenitor cells during osteogenesis than conventional CS. Additional studies are required to confirm whether THS is a better alternative for smokers to improve delays in bone healing following fracture.",

The aim of this study was to predict the effective factors of eating behaviors in the prevention of cardiovascular disease using the PRECEDE model. This cross-sectional study was performed on 400 subjects aged from 20 to 60 years old in Kerman, Iran in 2016. The participants were selected using a multistage random sampling method. A self-administered questionnaire including questions regarding demographic characteristics, eating behavior, and PRECEDE model constructs were completed by the participants. Data were analyzed using SPSS 22 and STATA 12. For data analysis, Spearman correlation coefficient, univariate and multiple median regression were applied. The predictive power of the model constructs was determined by analysis of artificial neural networks. Among participants, the score of knowledge was high (84.15\u00b110.7), and the scores of perceived self-efficacy (59.1\u00b116.57), reinforcing factors (60.66\u00b114.01), enabling factors (56.5\u00b112.91), and eating behavior (62.1\u00b114.7) were intermediate, and the score of attitude was low (47.84\u00b17.67). Attitude, self-perceived efficacy, enabling factors, and knowledge predicted 32%, 30%, 26%, and 0.93% of participants\u2019 eating behavior respectively. The relationship between all variables and eating behavior was positive and significant (p<0.0001). Perceived self-efficacy had the most, and reinforcing factors the least correlation with eating behavior. According to the results of this study, self-efficacy, attitude, and enabling factors were the main predicting factors for eating behaviors; therefore, to prevent cardiovascular disease and enhance healthy eating behavior, it is recommended to change attitude, and enhance self-efficacy and enabling factors in the community.",

The study explored and described the experiences of mothers of preterm infants regarding initiation and expressing breast milk, tube feeding practices, and transition to breastfeeding during the infants\u2019 stay in a kangaroo care unit (KMC) of an academic hospital in South Africa. Using a qualitative design, focus group interviews were conducted with 38 mothers of preterm infants after discharge from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). We analyzed transcripts following the 5 steps for qualitative thematic data analysis. Tube feeding and breastfeeding preterm infants was challenging and exhausting for the mothers. Many described their experiences of initiating expression and sustaining milk supply as negative. They had constant concerns about their ability to produce adequate milk volumes to feed their infants. They had immense dislike of expressing, which they described as physically exhausting, stressful, and painful. Those who had initiated breastfeeding were highly motivated to breastfeed their preterm infants. They described breastfeeding as a positive bonding experience that they derived pleasure from. The mothers\u2019 dislike of expressing was overshadowed by their emotional obligation toward their preterm infants. Although the KMC unit promotes breastfeeding, mothers encountered problems and struggled to initiate expression and sustain milk production. Mothers of extreme and very preterm infants need support to continue with milk expression during the long NICU and KMC stay.",

This phase\u00a02a study compared TAK\u2010954, a selective agonist of 5\u2010hydroxytryptamine type\u00a04 receptors, with metoclopramide in critically ill patients with EFI (NCT01953081). A blinded, double\u2010dummy trial was conducted in mechanically ventilated patients with EFI (>200\u00a0mL gastric residual volume within 24\u00a0hours before randomization). Patients were randomized to receive either 0.5\u00a0mg intravenous TAK\u2010954 over 1\u00a0hour then 0.9% saline injection 4 times/d (sham metoclopramide) or the active comparator 10\u00a0mg intravenous metoclopramide 4 times/d and a 1\u2010hour 0.9% saline infusion. After initial dosing, participants received a radiolabeled meal of liquid nutrient (Ensure; 106\u00a0kcal), and gastric emptying was measured (scintigraphy). Adverse events (AEs) were recorded from the time of consent through to day 5; serious AEs were collected to day 30. Thirteen patients (TAK\u2010954, n = 7; metoclopramide, n = 6) participated. Five patients in the TAK\u2010954 group and 4 in the metoclopramide group experienced AEs (2 and 3, respectively, were serious). All AEs except 1 (diarrhea in the metoclopramide group) were considered unrelated to study drug. Following treatment, a greater proportion of patients receiving TAK\u2010954 had normal gastric retention (<13% retention at 180\u00a0minutes) than those receiving metoclopramide (6/7 vs 3/6 patients, respectively). A single dose of 0.5\u00a0mg intravenous TAK\u2010954 appears to have at least similar efficacy in accelerating gastric emptying to multiple doses of 10\u00a0mg metoclopramide and was not associated with increased AEs.",

    "abstract": "The roles that energy expenditure (EE) and nutrient oxidation play in a predisposition for weight gain in humans remains unclear. We measured EE and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) in non-obese obesity prone (OP; n=22) and obesity resistant (OR; n=30) men and women following a eucaloric diet and after 3 days of overfeeding (1.4x basal energy). Twenty four hour EE, adjusted for fat free mass and sex, measured while consuming a eucaloric diet was not different between OP and OR subjects (2367 \u00b1 80 vs. 2285 \u00b1 98 kcals; p=0.53). Following overfeeding, EE increased in both OP and OR (OP: 2506 \u00b1 63.7, p<0.01; OR: 2386 \u00b1 99 kcals, p<0.05). Overfeeding resulted in an increase in 24h RER (OP: 0.857 \u00b1 0.01 to 0.893 \u00b1 0.01, p=0.01; OR: 0.852 \u00b1 0.01 to 0.886 \u00b1 0.01, p=0.005), with no difference between groups in either the eucaloric or overfeeding conditions (p>0.05). Nighttime RER (~10pm-6:30am) did not change with overfeeding in OR (0.823 \u00b1 0.02 vs. 0.837 \u00b1 0.01, p=0.29), but increased significantly in OP subjects (0.798 \u00b1 0.15 to 0.839 \u00b1 0.15, p<0.05), suggesting that fat oxidation during the night was down-regulated to a greater extent in OP subjects following a brief period of overfeeding, as compared to OR subjects who appeared to maintain their usual rate of fat oxidation. Protein oxidation increased significantly in both OP (p<0.001) and OR (p<0.01) with overfeeding, with no differences between OP and OR. These results support the idea that overfeeding a mixed diet results in increases in EE and RER, but these increases in EE and RER are likely not responsible for obesity resistance. Adaptive responses to overfeeding that occur during the night may play a role in opposing weight gain.",

    "abstract": "Cachexia is a complex syndrome defined by weight loss due to an ongoing loss of skeletal muscle mass with or without loss of body fat. It is often associated with anorexia. Numerous results from experimental studies suggest that blockade of the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) could be an effective treatment for anorexia and cachexia. In a previous study, we reported the basic pharmacological properties of a blocking anti-MC4R mAb 1E8a and its scFv derivative in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we further characterized the mode of action of the 1E8a scFv, evaluated its pharmacokinetic properties in mice, and assessed its therapeutic potential in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cachexia model in rats. In vitro, scFv enhanced the efficacy of the endogenous inverse agonist Agouti-related protein. After intravenous (i.v.) administration in mice, the scFv penetrated the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB) and reached its central sites of action: the scFv brain\u2013serum concentration ratios increased up to 15-fold which suggests an active uptake into brain tissue. In telemetry experiments, i.v. administration of the scFv in rats was well tolerated and only induced slight cardiovascular effects consistent with MC4R blockade, i.e., a small decrease in mean arterial pressure and heart rate. In the model of LPS-induced anorexia, i.v. administration of scFv 1E8a prevented anorexia and loss of body weight. Moreover, it stimulated a myogenic response which may contribute to the preservation of muscle mass in cachexia. The pharmacological profile of scFv 1E8a suggests its potential value in the treatment of cachexia or anorexia.",

    "abstract": "In our previous report, we demonstrated the possibility that various regulatory neuropeptides influence feeding behavior in the silkworm, Bombyx mori . Among these feeding-related neuropeptides, short neuropeptide F (sNPF) exhibited feeding-accelerating activity when injected into B. mori larvae. Like other insect sNPFs, the deduced amino acid sequence of the cDNA encoding the sNPF precursor appears to produce multiple sNPF and sNPF-related peptides in B. mori . The presence of three sNPFs, sNPF-1, sNPF-2, and sNPF-3, in the brain of B. mori larvae was confirmed by direct MALDI-TOF mass spectrometric profiling. In addition, all three sNPFs are present in other larval ganglia. The presence of sNPF mRNA in the central nervous system (CNS) was also confirmed by Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Semi-quantitative analyses of sNPFs in the larval brain using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry further revealed that brain sNPF levels decrease in response to starvation, and that they recover with the resumption of feeding. These data suggest that sNPFs were depleted by the starvation process. Furthermore, food deprivation decreased the transcriptional levels of the sNPF receptor (BNGR-A10) in the brain and CNS, suggesting that the sNPF system is dependent on the feeding state of the insect and that the sNPF system may be linked to locomotor activity associated with foraging behavior. Since the injection of sNPFs accelerated the onset of feeding in B. mori larvae, we concluded that sNPFs are strongly related to feeding behavior. In addition, semi-quantitative MS analyses revealed that allatostatin, which is present in the larval brain, is also reduced in response to starvation, whereas the peptide level of Bommyosuppressin was not affected by different feeding states.",

Rat pituitary cells were incubated with ANAM to evaluate its effect on growth hormone (GH) release. In vivo, rats were treated with ANAM 3, 10, or 30\u00a0mg/kg, or control orally, once daily for 6\u00a0days to evaluate the effect on food intake (FI) and body weight (BW), and once to assess GH response. In pigs, single (3.5\u00a0mg/kg) or continuous (1\u00a0mg/kg/day) ANAM doses were administered to assess GH and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) response. ANAM showed significant agonist and binding activity on the ghrelin receptor, and stimulated GH release in vitro. In rats, ANAM significantly and dose-dependently increased FI and BW at all dose levels compared with control, and significantly increased GH levels at 10 or 30\u00a0mg/kg doses. Increases in GH and IGF-1 levels were observed following ANAM administration in pigs. ANAM is a potent and highly specific ghrelin receptor agonist with significant appetite-enhancing activity, leading to increases in FI and BW, and a stimulatory effect on GH secretion. These results support the continued investigation of ANAM as a potential treatment of cancer anorexia-cachexia syndrome.",

    "abstract": "Background A novel approach is explored for improving causal inference in observational studies by comparing cohorts from high-income with low- or middle-income countries (LMIC), where confounding structures differ. This is applied to assessing causal effects of breastfeeding on child blood pressure (BP), body mass index (BMI) and intelligence quotient (IQ). Methods Standardized approaches for assessing the confounding structure of breastfeeding by socio-economic position were applied to the British Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) ( N \u2243\u20095000) and Brazilian Pelotas 1993 cohorts ( N \u2243\u20091000). This was used to improve causal inference regarding associations of breastfeeding with child BP, BMI and IQ. Analyses were extended to include results from a meta-analysis of five LMICs ( N \u2243\u200910\u2009000) and compared with a randomized trial of breastfeeding promotion. Findings Although higher socio-economic position was strongly associated with breastfeeding in ALSPAC, there was little such patterning in Pelotas. In ALSPAC, breastfeeding was associated with lower BP, lower BMI and higher IQ, adjusted for confounders, but in the directions expected if due to socioeconomic patterning. In contrast, in Pelotas, breastfeeding was not strongly associated with BP or BMI but was associated with higher IQ. Differences in associations observed between ALSPAC and the LMIC meta-analysis were in line with those observed between ALSPAC and Pelotas, but with robust evidence of heterogeneity detected between ALSPAC and the LMIC meta-analysis associations. Trial data supported the conclusions inferred by the cross-cohort comparisons, which provided evidence for causal effects on IQ but not for BP or BMI. Conclusion While reported associations of breastfeeding with child BP and BMI are likely to reflect residual confounding, breastfeeding may have causal effects on IQ. Comparing associations between populations with differing confounding structures can be used to improve causal inference in observational studies.",

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD, atopic eczema) is driven by a complex relationship between genetic predisposition and environmental exposures. We sought to determine the impact of specific climatic factors on the US prevalence of AD. We used a merged analysis of the 2007 National Survey of Children's Health from a representative sample of 91,642 children age 0\u201317 years and the 2006\u20132007 National Climate Data Center and Weather Service measurements of relative humidity (%), indoor heating degree days (HDD), clear sky UV indices ozone levels, and outdoor air temperature.

    "abstract": "Although neuroscience has made tremendous progress towards understanding the basic neural circuitry underlying important processes such as attention, memory and emotion, little progress has been made in applying these insights to psychiatric populations to make clinically meaningful treatment predictions. The overall aim of the Tulsa 1000 (T-1000) study is to use the NIMH Research Domain Criteria framework in order to establish a robust and reliable dimensional set of variables that quantifies the positive and negative valence, cognition and arousal domains, including interoception, to generate clinically useful treatment predictions. The T-1000 is a naturalistic study that will recruit, assess and longitudinally follow 1000 participants, including healthy controls and treatment-seeking individuals with mood, anxiety, substance use and eating disorders. Each participant will undergo interview, behavioural, biomarker and neuroimaging assessments over the course of 1\u2009year. The study goal is to determine how disorders of affect, substance use and eating behaviour organise across different levels of analysis (molecules, genes, cells, neural circuits, physiology, behaviour and self-report) to predict symptom severity, treatment outcome and long-term prognosis. The data will be used to generate computational models based on Bayesian statistics. The final end point of this multilevel latent variable analysis will be standardised assessments that can be developed into clinical tools to help clinicians predict outcomes and select the best intervention for each individual, thereby reducing the burden of mental disorders, and taking psychiatry a step closer towards personalised medicine. Ethical approval was obtained from Western Institutional Review Board screening protocol #20101611. The dissemination plan includes informing health professionals of results for clinical practice, submitting results to journals for peer-reviewed publication, presenting results at national and international conferences and making the dataset available to researchers and mental health professionals.

Data are from 633 employed adults participating in a cluster-randomized multilevel weight gain prevention intervention. Primary predictors included social support and social undermining for two types of behaviors (healthy eating and physical activity) from three sources (family, friends, and coworkers) obtained via self-administered surveys. The primary outcome (weight in kg) was measured by trained staff. Data were collected at baseline, 12 months, and 24 months. Linear multivariable models examined the association of support and social undermining with weight over time, adjusting for intervention status, time, gender, age, education, and clustering of individuals within schools. Adjusting for all primary predictors and covariates, friend support for healthy eating (\u03b2=\u22120.15), coworker support for healthy eating (\u03b2=\u22120.11), and family support for physical activity (\u03b2=\u22120.032) were associated with weight reduction at 24 months (p-values<0.05). Family social undermining for healthy eating was associated with weight gain at 24 months (\u03b2=0.12; p=0.0019). Among adult employees, friend and coworker support for healthy eating and family support for physical activity predicted improved weight management.

    "abstract": "Impulsive binge drinking is a serious public health issue, and to reveal predisposing factors to this consumption pattern is, therefore, required. Impulsivity-related traits are important predictors of alcohol use and abuse. Nonetheless, previous research in binge drinking has been confounded by various definitions and cut-off scores, implying that existing studies contributed to limited comprehension on the specific role of different impulsivity facets. The current study thus disentangles the role of impulsivity facets in binge drinking by adopting a dimensional approach, considering the condition on a continuum, to avoid relying on debatable and non-definitive criteria. 162 students underwent assessment of alcohol consumption, including drinking patterns and impulsive traits, as captured in the UPPS-P framework (i.e., negative urgency, positive urgency, sensation seeking, lack of perseverance, lack of premeditation). Multiple regression analyses were utilized in order to investigate the predictive role of each impulsivity facet in binge drinking. Binge drinking was associated with sensation seeking. However, when statistically controlling for gender, age and global alcohol consumption, this effect disappeared, and negative urgency remained the only impulsivity component that significantly predicted binge drinking. We found the severity of binge drinking to be associated with negative urgency, suggesting that the binge drinking pattern is displayed in reaction to negative emotional states, and can be conceptualized as a maladaptive and short-term emotional coping. The study calls for prevention and treatment interventions designed to improve self-control, and more adaptive emotion regulation strategies. \u2022 Binge drinking was assessed on a continuum to identify risk factors. \u2022 Severity of binge drinking was predicted by negative urgency. \u2022 The emotion regulation hypothesis of binge drinking was supported. \u2022 Teaching adaptive emotion regulation strategies could prevent binge drinking. Binge drinking was assessed on a continuum to identify risk factors. Severity of binge drinking was predicted by negative urgency. The emotion regulation hypothesis of binge drinking was supported.

    "abstract": "Thrombostasin (TS) is an anticlotting protein found in saliva of Haematobia irritans (horn flies). The polymorphic nature of the ts gene was first associated with success of horn flies blood feeding on a laboratory host, New Zealand White rabbits. In this study, we report results of similar studies testing blood uptake of horn flies feeding on a natural host, cattle. These studies confirmed the association of ts genotype with blood uptake of horn flies and showed that it was host species specific. In contrast to rabbits, blood uptake volumes of homozygous ts10 horn flies were lower than those of other ts genotypes when fed on control (ovalbumin-vaccinated) cattle. Cattle vaccinated with recombinant protein isoforms, rTS9 or rTB8, resisted horn fly feeding by yielding lower blood volumes compared with flies feeding on control cattle. The specific impact of vaccination, however, varied by ts genotype of flies. Cattle vaccinated with isoform rTS9 resisted flies of ts2 , ts9 , and tb8 genotype. Vaccination with isoform rTB8 produced resistance to ts8 , ts9 , and tb8 genotype flies. Horn flies of genotype ts10 were not affected by vaccination with either TS isoform and fed as well on rTS9- and rTB8-vaccinated as on control-vaccinated cattle. These experimental results confirm the efficacy of vaccines targeting horn fly salivary proteins and provide new insight into the dynamics of horn fly-cattle interactions in nature.",

    "abstract": "Few studies have investigated the relationship between predefined dietary patterns and type 2 diabetes incidence; little is known about the generalisability of these associations. We aimed to assess the association between predefined dietary patterns and type 2 diabetes risk in European populations. From among a case-cohort of 12,403 incident diabetes cases and 16,154 subcohort members nested within the prospective European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study, we used data on 9,682 cases and 12,595 subcohort participants from seven countries. Habitual dietary intake was assessed at baseline with country-specific dietary questionnaires. Two diet-quality scores (alternative Healthy Eating Index [aHEI], Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension [DASH] score) and three reduced rank regression (RRR)-derived dietary-pattern scores were constructed. Country-specific HRs were calculated and combined using a random-effects meta-analysis. After multivariable adjustment, including body size, the aHEI and DASH scores were not significantly associated with diabetes, although for the aHEI there was a tendency towards an inverse association in countries with higher mean age. We observed inverse associations of the three RRR-derived dietary-pattern scores with diabetes: HRs (95% CIs) for a 1-SD difference were 0.91 (0.86, 0.96), 0.92 (0.84, 1.01) and 0.87 (0.82, 0.92). Random-effects meta-analyses revealed heterogeneity between countries that was explainable by differences in the age of participants or the distribution of dietary intake. Adherence to specific RRR-derived dietary patterns, commonly characterised by high intake of fruits or vegetables and low intake of processed meat, sugar-sweetened beverages and refined grains, may lower type 2 diabetes risk.

    "abstract": "This study sought to document self-reported binge eating in a large sample of severely obese children and to examine the impact of binge eating on changes in percent overweight among children randomized to family-based behavioral treatment (Intervention) versus control (Usual Care). As part of a larger randomized controlled trial, 192 children ages 8-12 years (M = 10.2, SD = 1.2) with a mean BMI percentile of 99.2 (SD = 0.7) completed assessments at baseline and 6-, 12- and 18-months post-randomization. A parent or guardian also participated. Child psychological symptoms, including binge eating, were measured prior to randomization using self-report questionnaires. Child height and weight were measured at baseline, 6-, 12- and 18-months. The primary study outcome was percent overweight (i.e., percent over median BMI for age and sex). Twenty-two children (11.5%) endorsed binge eating at baseline (Binge Eating Group). Children in the Binge Eating Group were younger and had more depressive, anxiety and eating disorder symptoms and lower self-esteem than children in the rest of the sample (No Binge Eating Group). There also were differences between the Binge Eating and No Binge Eating groups with respect to the short-term effects of treatment group assignment on change in percent overweight during the study. Specifically, improvements in percent overweight in the Intervention condition relative to Usual Care were documented in the No Binge Eating Group only. Among children in the Binge Eating Group, those assigned to Intervention showed a 2.6% increase in percent overweight, on average, at the completion of acute treatment as compared to an 8.5% decrease among children without binge eating. However, these effects were not maintained during follow-up. Results of this study suggest the importance of considering binge eating in the development of weight management programs for severely obese youth.",

Twenty female patients with AN (median age =30.0 years, quartile deviation =6.8) and 40 female healthy controls (HCs) (median age =30.0 years, quartile deviation =8.6) participated in the present study. Resilience was assessed with the Connor\u2013 Davidson resilience scale (CD-RISC). Clinical symptoms were evaluated with the structured interview guide for the Hamilton depression rating scale (SIGH-D) and the eating disorder inventory-2 (EDI-2). Scores of the CD-RISC in the AN group were lower than those in the HC group, and the SIGH-D score in the AN group was higher than that in the HC group. Scores of interoceptive confusion, interpersonal difficulty and negative self-image subscales of the EDI-2 negatively correlated with the CD-RISC score. Moreover, stepwise regression analysis showed that negative self-image score was an independent predictor of the CD-RISC score. These results suggest that among these clinical factors including psychopathologies, self-dissatisfaction and feeling of being rejected by others are the most important influencing factors on an AN patients\u2019 resilience.",

However, the molecular mechanism triggered by and/or responsible for such modulations in behaviour is poorly understood. Clock genes are known to be responsible for the control of circadian behaviour in several species. Here we investigate the impact mating and blood-feeding have upon the expression of these genes in the mosquito Aedes aegypti . We show that blood intake, but not insemination, is responsible for the down-regulation of clock genes. Using RNA interference, we observe a slight reduction in the evening activity peak in the fourth day after dstim injection. These data suggest that, as in Drosophila , clock gene expression, circadian behaviour and environmental light regimens are interconnected in Ae. aegypti .",

Medical students are subjected to high levels of stress and have a high risk of developing burnout and mental health problems, including eating disorders. Due to societal stigma and lack of awareness, it is plausible that disordered eating behaviors among students may go unrecognized and under-reported. The current study aimed to evaluate the prevalence and possible factors associated with eating disorders among medical students at the American University of Beirut in Lebanon (AUB). This cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted in 2017 at AUB. Electronic anonymous surveys were sent to all 412 medical students, with a mean age of 23, enrolled in our four-year medical school. In addition to demographic data, students were asked to complete two validated questionnaires, the SCOFF and EAT-26, to assess eating disorders risk. Total responses were 156, out of which 124 completed the whole survey. A total of 131 participants completed the Eat-26 questionnaire and 124 participants completed the SCOFF questionnaire. Out of those, 17% on EAT-26 and 19% on SCOFF were found to be at high risk of developing eating disorders. There seems to be a high level of underrecognized and under-treated disordered eating behaviors among female medical students at AUB.

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly affected the mental health of individuals due to severe changes in their normal life routines. These changes might give rise to stress-induced factors and result in developing maladaptive behaviors. Therefore, the present study tested an explorative sequential mediation model regarding the COVID-19 pandemic as a global natural experiment and hypothesized that fear and depression would be serial mediators of the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and emotional eating. An online cross-sectional survey with convenience sampling was adopted. A total of 362 participants were recruited from Turkey, and each completed a battery of demographic questions and psychometric scales. The standardized instruments used to test the model\u2019s constructs were the Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale, Fear of COVID-19 Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire-R21. The model was tested using a bootstrapping method utilizing IBM AMOS 24 software. Results showed that emotional eating was positively associated with intolerance of uncertainty, fear of COVID-19, and depression. Moreover, fear of COVID-19 had positive correlation with intolerance of uncertainty and depression. Significant negative association was also found between age and intolerance of uncertainty. In addition, females significantly reported higher levels of emotional eating and fear of COVID-19 than males. The study\u2019s hypothesized sequential mediation model was further supported. It is concluded that depression most likely developed by fear was triggered by intolerance of uncertainty during the COVID-19 pandemic and leading to emotional eating. The study is significant because it advances theories of emotional eating with an investigation examining some of its underlying mechanisms. Also, it is one of a few research studies highlighting to what extent the COVID-19 pandemic-related cognitions and emotions are associated with maladaptive behaviors in the case of emotional eating.",

Several kinds of diet are recommended for children with ASD. This study determines the frequency of eating disorders and obesity among such children. We investigate the predisposing factors of eating disorders and examine the effects of consumed food on autism scores. In this single-centre, cross-sectional study, 46 children with ASD aged between 2 and 10 years were included. Anthropometric measurements were recorded and Brief Autism Mealtime Behavior Inventory (BAMBI), Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC), and Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) forms were filled in by their parents. The rates of being overweight and obese were 10.9% and 28.3%, respectively. Food selectivity was observed in 84.8% of the children, and BAMBI food refusal scores were significantly higher for those aged between 2 and 5 years ( p =\u00a00.03). Autism scores and consumption of milk, yoghurt, oily seeds, rice/pasta, and fruits ( p <\u00a00.05) were significantly correlated. There were also significant differences between these scores and the frequency of consuming eggs, legumes, and other cereals ( p <\u00a00.05). Obesity was more common in children with ASD than typically developed children. Despite the high rate of food selectivity, our findings confirmed that food selectivity could be considered independent of obesity. Further, the diet of patients with ASD must include more fruits, yogurt, eggs, legumes, other cereals, less milk, and less rice/pasta.",

Software was utilized to develop an SLM for third-year medical students utilizing video clips demonstrating the evolution of a clinical BED case from presentation to follow-up over 10\u201312 weeks. The focus is on differential diagnosis and management, with intermittent self-assessment quizzes and other evidence-based literature for further study.

By having her needs therapeutically attended to, she receives help through focused cognitive behavioral therapy, the use of food log monitoring, and medications. This SLM on BED has been implemented at the University of Toronto as an optional component of the psychiatry clerkship over the 2015/2016 academic year. Written and verbal feedback from faculty ( n = 5) and students ( n = 5) has been overwhelmingly positive.

Our goal was to determine whether breastfeeding truly provides protection against APNs, while investigating the effects of other factors such as sex, age, mode of delivery, and birth weight on APN. A total of 62 infants under 6 months of age who had both microbiologically and radiologically-confirmed APN were enrolled in the case group. Healthy infants (n = 178) who visited the hospital for scheduled vaccinations were enrolled in the control group. The following participant characteristics were compared between the case and control groups: age, sex, birth order among siblings, feeding methods, weight percentile by month, birth weight percentile by gestational age, gestational age at birth, and mode of delivery. Babies exclusively fed with manufactured infant formulae before 6 months of age had significantly higher risk for APN than breastfed or mixed-fed infants (odds ratio [OR], 3.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.687\u20137.031; P = 0.001). Firstborn babies had lower risk for APN than 2nd- or 3rd-born babies (OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.210\u20130.919). Other factors that increased the risk for APN were low birth weight percentiles (OR, 8.33; 95% CI, 2.300\u201330.166) and birth via caesarean section (OR, 2.32; 95% CI, 1.097\u20134.887). There were more preterm births in the case group (10.9% vs. 1.7%; P = 0.002), but this did not increase the risk for APN (OR, 4.47; P = 0.063). Feeding exclusively with formula before 6 months of age was related to higher risk for APN, which demonstrates that breastfeeding has a protective effect against APN. The other risk factors for APN were birth order (\u2265 2nd-born), low birth weight, and birth via caesarean section.",

    "abstract": "In this paper, we investigate the short-term and long-term effects of the COVID-19 emergency on consumers' decision of changing dietary habit. We used a certified dataset reporting information about 456 Italian consumers during the lockdown in the first wave of the pandemic emergency (April 2020). The survey collected data about changes in food purchases, respondents' mood during the lockdown, conspiracist beliefs, exposure to the virus, and planned food purchasing behavior after the lockdown. We used the data to construct measures of the psychological pressure exerted by the COVID-19 emergency on consumers. We use an endogenous selection regression model to assess the impact of psychological pressure on the decision of changing food purchased. The analysis identified two opposite approaches to change in food purchasing decisions: impulsive approach and reflective approach. The former is associated with a higher probability of changing food purchase but a lower probability to keep the changes in the long run than the latter. Our results suggest that COVID-19 psychological pressure was associated with impulsive approach to buy food. Consequently, food-purchasing behavior is expected to revert to pre-COVID 19 habits when the emergency is over.

    "abstract": "The clinical picture of an acute abdomen is frequently encountered in emergency medicine. In most cases abdominal pathologies underlie this condition, however, also extra-abdominal diseases may present or cause an acute abdomen. The fact that this condition is potentially life-threatening highlights the importance of instant action. Here, we report on the case of a young woman that presented with an acute abdomen in our clinic. Imaging revealed a massively distended stomach reaching the lesser pelvis. Initially, the etiology for the gastric dilatation remained unsolved. On the same day we performed an explorative laparotomy in which massive amounts of clotted, undigested food was recovered via a gastrotomy. Postoperatively, upon psychiatric consultation, an eating disorder with daily eating binges could be revealed as being the cause for the acute and dramatic gastric dilatation. The patient fully recovered from surgery and psychiatric co-treatment was initiated. This unique case report demonstrates how a psychiatric condition may lead to an acute abdomen, however, it also emphasizes the importance of prompt diagnosis and adequate therapy to avoid complications and allowing for full recovery.",

    "abstract": "The water-to-land transition is a major event in vertebrate history, involving significant changes to feeding structures and mechanics. In water, fish often use suction-feeding to capture prey, but this feeding strategy is not possible on land. Therefore, it has been traditionally believed that the invasion of land involved a shift from suction-based prey capture to mechanisms based on biting and snapping. Computed tomography analysis of Tiktaalik roseae , a key intermediate in tetrapod evolution, compared with extant analogs (gars and polypterids), reveals a rigid skull, capable of biting, with joint morphologies suggestive of cranial kinesis and suction generation. An intermediate condition that utilizes both feeding strategies helps explain some of the key morphological changes in cranial anatomy during the water-to-land transition. Changes to feeding structures are a fundamental component of the vertebrate transition from water to land. Classically, this event has been characterized as a shift from an aquatic, suction-based mode of prey capture involving cranial kinesis to a biting-based feeding system utilizing a rigid skull capable of capturing prey on land. Here we show that a key intermediate, Tiktaalik roseae , was capable of cranial kinesis despite significant restructuring of the skull to facilitate biting and snapping. Lateral sliding joints between the cheek and dermal skull roof, as well as independent mobility between the hyomandibula and palatoquadrate, enable the suspensorium of T. roseae to expand laterally in a manner similar to modern alligator gars and polypterids. This movement can expand the spiracular and opercular cavities during feeding and respiration, which would direct fluid through the feeding apparatus. Detailed analysis of the sutural morphology of T. roseae suggests that the ability to laterally expand the cheek and palate was maintained during the fish-to-tetrapod transition, implying that limited cranial kinesis was plesiomorphic to the earliest limbed vertebrates. Furthermore, recent kinematic studies of feeding in gars demonstrate that prey capture with lateral snapping can synergistically combine both biting and suction, rather than trading off one for the other. A \u201cgar-like\u201d stage in early tetrapod evolution might have been an important intermediate step in the evolution of terrestrial feeding systems by maintaining suction-generation capabilities while simultaneously elaborating a mechanism for biting-based prey capture.",

    "abstract": "Tumor treating fields, a noninvasive cancer treatment using low intensity alternating electric fields, offers clinical opportunities with unique challenges. This review focuses on the mechanism of action of this treatment, the known pre\u2010clinical and clinical experience, and the practical issues surrounding its use in the multidisciplinary management of patients with solid malignancies. Tumor\u2010treating fields (TTFields) are a noninvasive antimitotic cancer treatment consisting of low\u2010intensity alternating electric fields delivered to the tumor or tumor bed via externally applied transducer arrays. In multiple in vitro and in vivo cancer cell lines, TTFields therapy inhibits cell proliferation, disrupts cell division, interferes with cell migration and invasion, and reduces DNA repair. Human trials in patients with primary glioblastoma showed an improvement in overall survival, and trials in patients with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma showed favorable outcomes compared with historical control. This led to U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval in both clinical situations, paving the way for development of trials investigating TTFields in other malignancies. Although these trials are ongoing, the existing evidence suggests that TTFields have activity outside of neuro\u2010oncology, and further study into the mechanism of action and clinical activity is required. In addition, because TTFields are a previously unrecognized antimitotic therapy with a unique mode of delivery, the oncological community must address obstacles to widespread patient and provider acceptance. TTFields will likely join surgery, systemic therapy, and radiation therapy as a component of multimodality management of patients with solid malignancies. Tumor\u2010treating fields (TTFields) exhibit a broad range of antitumor activities. Clinically, they improve overall survival for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. The emergence of TTFields has changed the treatment regimen for glioblastoma. Clinicians need to understand the practical issues surrounding its use in the multidisciplinary management of patients with glioblastoma. With ongoing clinical trials, TTFields likely will become another treatment modality for solid malignancies.",

However, exclusive breastfeeding in Indonesia only reached 52.3% in 2014 and 65.16% in 2018. It is known that administration of infant formula and non-formula supplements to infants aged less than 6 months increases the risk of Acute Respiratory Infections (ARIs). In addition, the high prevalence of ARIs in infants in Sleman Regency, Indonesia indicates the need of optimal early prevention. Therefore, we conducted this study to confirm that mothers\u2019 knowledge of breastfeeding and infant feeding types affect the prevalence of Acute Respiratory Infections (ARIs). Data were collected through questionnaires from 50 mothers with infants aged 7-12 months who had experienced ARIs in the last 3 months (case group) and 50 mothers with healthy infants (control group). Collected data were then analysed using Chi-Square, Logistic Regression, Lambda, and Somers\u2019 D tests. The results showed that types of infant feeding are associated with the prevalence of ARIs. Non-breastfed infants were 14 times riskier to contract ARIs. Mothers\u2019 knowledge of exclusive breastfeeding influenced their preferences of feeding practice. However, their attitude towards breastfeeding did not appear to significantly affect their choices of feeding practice. Exclusive breastfeeding during the first 6 months of an infant\u2019s life can lower the prevalence of ARIs for when they are older. Mothers\u2019 good knowledge of breastfeeding is associated with its practice.",

To examine the current literature on the experiences and perspectives of those across healthcare interfaces for eating disorders, to include individuals with eating disorders, people close to or caring for those with eating disorders such as family and friends, and health professionals. To identify relevant papers, a systematic search of electronic databases was conducted. Other methods, including hand-searching, scanning reference lists and internet resources were also used. Papers that met inclusion criteria were analysed using a systematic methodology and synthesised using an interpretative thematic approach. Sixty-three papers met the inclusion criteria. The methodological quality was relatively good. The included papers were of both qualitative ( n = 44) and quantitative studies ( n = 24) and were from ten different countries. By synthesising the literature of these papers, three dominant themes were identified, with additional subthemes.

The aim of this study is to assess alexithymia in anorexic adolescent patients and in their parents using a multimethod measurement to gain more direct, in-depth knowledge of the problem. Forty-six subjects, anorexic adolescent patients and their parents, underwent the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) along with the Toronto Structured Interview for Alexithymia (TSIA), which represents the first comprehensive clinically structured interview focused specifically on assessing alexithymia. The use of latent trait Rasch analysis allowed a comparison of the two instruments\u2019 sensitivity and ability to detect the presence and intensity of alexithymic components in patients and parents. Significant discordance was found between the two measures. The clinical instrument allowed detection of a greater level of alexithymia compared with the self-report, in particular in our adult parent sample. Moreover, a significant alexithymic gap emerged within families, particularly within parental couples, with noticeably more alexithymic fathers compared with the mothers. The TSIA clinical interview may be a more sensitive instrument in detecting alexithymia, minimizing parents\u2019 negation tendency. Clinical questions have arisen on how useful it would be to give greater weight to family functioning (ie, alexithymic gap) in order to predict the possibility of establishing a therapeutic alliance, and thus the outcome of the anorexic adolescent.",

To date, only few studies examined the potential overlap between EXD and other addictive behaviors. Therefore, the present study aimed at investigating the relationship of EXD with pathological buying, pathological video gaming (offline and online), hypersexual behavior, and alcohol use disorder in a sample of clients of fitness centers. The following questionnaires were answered by 128 individuals (age M =\u200926.5, SD =\u20096.7 years; 71.7% men, 74.2% university students): Exercise Dependence Scale, Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire, Compulsive Buying Scale, Pathological Computer-Gaming Scale, Hypersexual Behavior Inventory, and Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT). 7.8% of the sample were at-risk for EXD, 10.9% reported eating disorder pathology, 2.3% pathological buying, 3.1% hypersexual behavior, and none of the participants suffered from pathological video gaming. The criteria for severe alcohol disorder pathology (AUDIT\u2009\u2265\u200916) were fulfilled by 10.2%. With regard to continuous symptom scores, EXD symptoms were positively correlated with both eating disorder pathology and pathological buying but not with pathological video gaming, hypersexuality or alcohol use disorder. It is noteworthy that more symptoms of pathological buying corresponded with more symptoms of hypersexual behavior. The correlation pattern did not differ by gender. The co-occurrence of EXD, pathological buying and hypersexual behavior on a subclinical level or in the early stage of the disorders should be taken into account when assessing and treating patients. More research is warranted in order to investigate possible interactions between these conditions.",

Early changes in eating behaviours and psychological factors were evaluated by questionnaires at baseline and Month 1. The influence of these early changes on the trajectory of weight loss from baseline to Months 3 and 12 was assessed by random coefficients models. Although there were no differences in weight loss between intervention groups at the end of the trial, certain individual factors were shown to predict both early weight loss at Month 3 and longer\u2010term weight loss at Month 12. Across all participants, increases in dietary restraint and healthy lifestyle ratings in the first month predicted more rapid weight loss from baseline to Month 3 ( P <\u00a00.05) and also predicted more rapid weight loss and slower regain from baseline to Month 12 (both P <\u00a00.01). Early attendance and changes in disinhibition were not associated with subsequent weight loss. Changes in psychological and behavioural measures, such as restraint, in the first month of weight loss intervention predicted longer\u2010term weight loss in women. Early additional support or tailored treatment could promote long\u2010term success by reinforcing these behaviours.",

    "abstract": "Given that females exhibit a greater prevalence of eating disorders, there is of yet no conclusive evidence whether participation in college athletics exacerbates eating disorders or body shape dissatisfaction. This study assessed how gender and participation in collegiate athletics are associated with increased risk for disordered eating attitudes and body shape concerns in college students. This study used a cross-sectional research design. A total of 302 students at a Southern US university fully completed the eating attitudes test and the body shape questionnaire during class time or team meetings. Logistic regression was conducted to determine risk differentials for each group. Of 302 students, 65.6% were females and 63.2% were non-athletes. Athletic status was significant as well but became slightly less so with adjustment (unadjusted at OR = 3.14, P < 0.001 vs. adjusted OR = 3.22, P < 0.001). Moreover, it was found that that non-athletic female students are slightly more at risk for disordered eating and significantly more dissatisfied with their body shape (OR = 5.95, P < 0.001). Although there seems to still be many unresolved issues regarding eating disorders, one thing is clear females are at higher risk, and it remains a significant challenge to college health services. College health practitioners should be made aware of the significant effect stress has on freshman in particular.",

The descriptors \u201cbreastfeeding\u201d, \u201cprofessional role\u201d and \u201cpatient care team\u201d were used in the research. The review was limited to articles in Portuguese, Spanish, and English published between 1997 and 2013. The search retrieved 1396 studies, 18 of which were selected for being directly relevant to the main question. The review showed that breastfeeding is a challenge for health professionals, regardless of their specialization, as they have to face a demand that requires skill and sensibility, for which they are not prepared. Health professionals have considered breastfeeding a purely instinctive and biological act. Moreover, it is noticeable that many of them possess theoretical expertise on the subject, but lack the practical skills. Health professionals need to be better trained to work on promoting breastfeeding, whether by health and medical schools or by healthcare administrators, in order to consolidate multiprofessional teams committed to maternal-infant health.

    "abstract": "Parental depression is a risk factor for childhood obesity. To examine the influence of parental depression on child weight status, eating behaviours, and parental feeding practices during childhood obesity treatment. Hundred and twenty eight children with obesity aged 4 to 6\u2009years and their parents were randomized to a parent support program or to standard treatment. At baseline and after 12\u2009months, children's heights and weights were measured. Parents reported levels of depression (Beck's Depression Inventory\u2010II), feeding practices (Child Feeding Questionnaire), and children's eating behaviors (Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire). Independent and dependent paired sample t\u2010tests and linear regressions were used to analyze data. After obesity treatment, mothers reported lower levels of depression, whereas fathers did not. No associations were found between parental level of depression and child weight status, or between baseline level of parental depression and feeding practices. Associations were found between baseline parental depression and children's food responsiveness (\u03b2 = .03; P = .01; 95% CI [0.01, 0.05]), emotional overeating (\u03b2 = .02; P = .02; 95% CI [0.004, 0.04]), and desire to drink (\u03b2 = .02; P = .03; 95% CI [0.002, 0.04]) (adjusted for background variables).

    "abstract": " Background : Enteral feeding via feeding tube (FT) provides essential nutrition support to critically ill patients or those who cannot intake adequate nutrition via the oral route. Unfortunately, 1%\u20132% of FTs placed blindly at bedside enter the airway undetected (as confirmed by x\u2010ray), where they could result in adverse events. Misplaced FTs can cause complications including pneumothorax, vocal cord injury, bronchopleural fistula, pneumonia, and death. X\u2010ray is typically performed to confirm FT placement before feeding, but may delay nutrition intake, may not universally identify misplacement, and adds cost and radiation exposure. Methods : A prospective case series was conducted to evaluate a novel FT with a camera to provide real\u2010time visualization, guiding placement. The primary end point was the clinician's ability to identify anatomical markers in the gastrointestinal tract and/or airway using the camera. Results : The Kangaroo Feeding Tube with IRIS Technology tube was placed in 45 subjects with 1 misplaced tube; 3 placements were postpyloric, with the remainder gastric. Clinicians correctly identified the stomach in 44 of 45 placements at a median depth of 60.0 cm (range 45.0\u201385.0 cm). A stomach image was obtained in 42 subjects (93.3%). Agreement between camera image and radiographic confirmation of placement was 93% ( P = .014) with small deviations in recognizing stomach vs small bowel. No device\u2010related adverse events occurred. Conclusions : Direct visualization of the stomach using a camera\u2010equipped FT can assist with FT placement, help avoid misplacements, and with further studies to evaluate the safety of eliminating confirmatory x\u2010ray before feeding, could potentially preclude the need for radiographic confirmation.",

The aim of this work was to explore this relationship, considering if CD could be associated with specific baseline AN-related clinical features. In this retrospective study, 82 adolescent female out- and inpatients with AN of the restrictive type (ANr), according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition criteria, were recruited. CD diagnosis and related serology were recorded, including tissue transglutaminase type-2 antibodies, endomysial antibodies, and antibodies against deamidated forms of gliadin peptides. Eating disorder inventory-3, Children\u2019s Depression Inventory, body mass index, age, and disease duration data recorded at the time of blood withdrawal were also obtained from each patient. Five (6.1%) subjects presented a CD disorder associated with AN: none of the collected psychometric measures was significantly correlated with any CD-related parameter or characterized as a specific subgroup. CD diagnosis or serology does not relate to ANr clinical or demographic characteristics. However, a slight increase in prevalence with respect to the general population might be hypothesized and possibly elucidated by further studies with an appropriate design.",

    "abstract": "A significant barrier to recovery for individuals with co-morbid eating disorders and type 1 diabetes is the way in which group members self-categorise. Nonetheless, identity issues are neglected during the recovery process. The aim of this paper is to explore how group memberships (and the associated identities) both contribute to and hinder recovery in this cohort. Transcripts from five online focus groups with 13 members of an online support group for individuals with \u2018Diabulimia\u2019 were thematically analysed. Findings suggested that those with whom one shares a recovery identity can be well placed to provide psychological resources necessary for successful recovery although such connections can be damaging if group norms are not managed. Members recognised that other important relationships (including family and friends and health professionals) are also key to recovery; these other group memberships (and the associated identities) can be facilitated through the recovery identity group membership, which allows for external validation of the recovery identity, provides encouragement to disclose the illness to supportive others, and provides information to facilitate positive service interactions. While clinical interventions typically focus on eliminating disordered behaviours, we suggest that these should also include strengthening important group memberships that promote recovery. \u2022 Forming connections with similar others online promotes recovery from \u2018Diabulimia.\u2019 \u2022 Group self-regulation ensures interactions foster adaptive behaviours. \u2022 The online group complements rather than replaces health service engagement. \u2022 Recovery identities assist in managing relationships with other valued groups. \u2022 Clinicians should support individuals accessing appropriate online recovery fora.

This study aims to define alexithymia\u2019s connections with shame, trauma, dissociation, and body image disorders. We administered the Dissociative Experience Scale-II, Trauma Symptom Inventory, Experience of Shame Scale, Toronto Alexithymia Scale-20, and Body Uneasiness Test questionnaires to 143 ED subjects. Extensive statistical analyses were performed. The subjects showed higher scores on alexithymia, shame, dissociation, and traumatic feelings scales than the nonclinical population. These aspects are linked with each other in a statistically significant way. Partial correlations highlighted that feelings of shame are correlated to body dissatisfaction, irrespective of trauma or depressed mood. Multiple regression analysis demonstrates that shame (anorexic patients) and perceived traumatic conditions (bulimic and ED not otherwise specified) are associated with adverse image disorders. Shame seems to hold a central role in the perception of an adverse self-image. Alexithymia may be interpreted as being a consequence of previous unelaborated traumatic experiences and feelings of shame, and it could therefore be conceptualized as a maladaptive\u2013reactive construct.",

    "abstract": "This knowledge mobilization project was conceptualized to increase awareness among breastfeeding mothers and the general public on safe infant feeding practices during the COVID-19 pandemic by addressing myths and misconceptions associated with breastfeeding practices, guiding breastfeeding mothers to make informed decisions around child feeding practices, and offering meaningful guidance in simple language through a short online animated video. This project was undertaken in four phases. During phase 1, an informal discussion was held with the breastfeeding mothers, service providers, and community partner in identifying issues surrounding lactation counselling facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. During phase 2, recommendations from 23 organizations with regard to breastfeeding during COVID-19 were reviewed and analyzed. During phase 3, using evidence from reliable sources, a 5-minute animated e-resource on breastfeeding during COVID-19 was conceptualized and developed. During phase 4, the e-resource was disseminated to the breastfeeding mothers, general public, post-secondary institutions, and organizations providing services to breastfeeding mothers in Canada. This evidence-based e-resource facilitated addressing misconceptions around breastfeeding during COVID-19 and raising public awareness on safe infant feeding practices during this pandemic. Overall, the video was described as an informative, user-friendly, useful, and easily accessible resource by breastfeeding mothers who were in self-isolation with little access to healthcare services during the pandemic. This project highlighted the importance of patient engagement and collaboration with the community partner in protecting breastfeeding during the COVID-19\u00a0pandemic. It further illustrated how informational e-resources can protect breastfeeding in situations where breastfeeding mothers\u2019 access to healthcare services is compromised.",

    "abstract": "The present study was designed to assess progesterone profiles at the secreted (caudal vena cava) and circulating levels (jugular vein) and luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion pattern in lactating and non-lactating cows with reference to feeding. Four lactating and four non-lactating cycling Holstein cows were examined. Blood samples were collected simultaneously from the caudal vena cava (via a catheter inserted from the coccygeal vein) and the jugular vein every 15 min for 12 h (0500\u20131700 h) during the functional luteal phase. Cows were fed 50% of the daily diet 6 h after the start of blood sampling. During the 12-h sampling period, mean progesterone concentrations in the caudal vena cava did not differ between lactating and non-lactating cows (49.0 \u00b1 2.9 and 53.3 \u00b1 3.7 ng/ml; mean \u00b1 SE), whereas mean progesterone concentrations in the jugular vein in lactating cows were higher than those in non-lactating cows (6.4 \u00b1 0.1 and 5.6 \u00b1 0.1 ng/ml, P < 0.001). Lactating cows had a higher frequency of LH pulses than non-lactating cows (7.0 \u00b1 0.7 and 4.3 \u00b1 0.9 pulses/12 h, P<0.05). The influence of feeding was not observed on LH profiles but was observed on progesterone profiles in both veins. Progesterone concentrations in the caudal vena cava increased after feeding in both groups. Progesterone concentrations in the jugular vein decreased after feeding in lactating cows but not in non-lactating cows. These results indicate the difference in feeding-related changes in progesterone dynamics between lactating and non-lactating cows.",

Secondary analyses of cross-sectional data from the 2010 Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey. The survey used a stratified two-stage cluster sample of 10\u2005312 households from eight geographical zones of Tanzania. The sample consisted of 3112 children aged 0\u201323\u2005months. Outcome measures were factors significantly associated with delayed initiation of breastfeeding, non-exclusive breastfeeding and predominant breastfeeding in the first 6\u2005months. Breastfeeding was initiated within the first hour of birth in 46.1% of mothers. In infants aged less than 6\u2005months, the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding was 49.9% but only 22.9% were exclusively breastfed at 4\u20135\u2005months. Seventeen per cent of infants, less than 6\u2005months of age, were \u2018predominantly breastfed\u2019. At 12\u201315\u2005months, 94.0% of infants were still breastfed but the proportion decreased to 51.1% at 20\u201323\u2005months of age. Multivariate analysis revealed that the risk of delayed initiation of breastfeeding within 1\u2005h after birth was significantly higher among young mothers aged <24\u2005years, uneducated and employed mothers from rural areas who delivered by caesarean section and those who delivered at home and were assisted by traditional birth attendants or relatives. The risk factors associated with non-exclusive breastfeeding, during the first 6\u2005months, were lack of professional assistance at birth and residence in urban areas. The risk of predominant breastfeeding was significantly higher among infants from the Zanzibar geographical zone. Early initiation of breastfeeding and exclusive breastfeeding indicators were unsatisfactory and are below the national targets for Tanzania. To improve breastfeeding practices, national level programmes will be required, but with a focus on the target groups with suboptimal breastfeeding practices.",

The aims of our study were the description of nutritional status, its associated factors, and the detection of eating disorders among Romanian medical students of the \u201cIuliu Hatieganu\u201d University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Cluj-Napoca. A cross-sectional study was conducted during the 2015\u20132016 academic year, including medical students from all study years, by an online questionnaire. The statistics, both descriptive and inferential, were calculated using EpiInfo. A total of 222 students from the University Romanian section were included, with a sex-ratio (men:women) of 0.22. The average body mass index of the medical students included was 21.3\u00b13.3 kg/m2, for females it was 20.7\u00b13 kg/m2 and for males 23.9\u00b13.1 kg/m2. For the nutritional disorders such as overweight, the prevalence among males (30%) had a net predominance (p<0.001) over females (4.4%), while for underweight, it was prevalent only for female students (20.3%). Overweight was associated with low academic performance (odds ratio (OR)=7.2; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1\u201353.94), smoking (OR=2.4; 95% CI: 1\u20135.76) and binge drinking (OR=3; 95% CI: 1.26\u20137.25).

    "abstract": "Breastfeeding as an infant appears protective against later development of some autoimmune diseases, but research into its influence on multiple sclerosis (MS) risk has yielded inconclusive results. We investigated the possible impact of breastfeeding on MS risk. We used two population-based case\u2013control studies comprising 3670 cases and 6737 matched controls. Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for association between MS and exposure to prolonged breastfeeding (4 months or longer) versus reduced breastfeeding (less than 4 months). A meta-analysis of case\u2013control studies that assessed the impact of breastfeeding on MS risk among women and men was conducted. Prolonged breastfeeding was associated with reduced MS risk among men (OR 0.7, 95% CI 0.5\u20130.9) but not among women (OR 0.9, 95% CI 0.8\u20131.1). Among men, a synergistic effect was observed between HLA-DRB1*15:01 carrier status and reduced breastfeeding. Findings from the current study add to accumulating evidence that breastfeeding may be a modifiable protective factor for reducing the risk of MS in offspring. When possible, mothers should be supported to breastfeed their infants; however, the mechanism of a sex-specific biologic effect of breastfeeding on MS risk is unclear.",

A randomized controlled, single-center study was conducted over a period of 3 years (November 2015\u2013October 2018) at a tertiary care center. Patients ( n = 147), after colostomy closure (as elective colorectal surgery), were randomly selected for postoperative feeding initiation and were divided into two groups, namely the control (traditional feeding) group and study group (early feeding). In early group, feeding was initiated on the postoperative day 1 after the removal of nasogastric tube (removed after 16 h of surgery). Postoperative hospital stay and complications were compared among them. Data were tabulated and analyzed in Microsoft Excel 2010. Among 147 patients (boys[70] and girls [77]), the average age of colostomy closure was 4.36 years. Forty-five patients had early feeding and 102 traditional feeding. Average postoperative hospital stay was noted 5.62 \u00b1 1.11 days for \u201cStudy group\u201d and 8.1 \u00b1 1.04 days for \u201cControl group.\u201d Postoperative complications were found in 17 patients; 11 (7.5%) superficial surgical site infection (9 [8.8%] in control and 2 [4.4%] in study group) and 6 (4%) minor fecal fistulae (5 [4.9%] in control group and 1 [2.2%] in study group). None required any further surgical intervention. No mortality was reported. Early feeding initiation after elective colorectal surgery is safe, and postoperative hospital stay is significantly reduced. It is definitely a step forward in the era of fast track surgery in pediatric population.",

    "abstract": "An emerging body of literature has highlighted the significance of breastmilk oligosaccharides and dietary fibers in complementary weaning foods for the development of the infant\u2019s microbiome that has both short- and long-term health implications. This review highlights the newborns\u2019 consumption of fiber and oligosaccharides as directly linked to the mother\u2019s diet, and that current dietary recommendations for pregnant mothers in the United States and globally fall short in both addressing the importance of dietary fiber intake for enhancing mother\u2019s health and establishing the developing infant microbiome. Although limited in data, there is suggestion for maternal dietary interventions to include healthy fibers as an effective means of promoting infant health via modification of breast milk composition. This paper argues that there is an urgent need for a two-fold national policy that addresses the significance of fiber in breastfeeding mothers\u2019 diets and modifies the dietary recommendations accordingly, and provides a paid parental leave, which would enable mothers to not only breastfeed for at least six months, but to also effectively follow the dietary recommendations needed to support breast milk quality that is linked to their infants\u2019 health.",

    "abstract": "The male accessory glands (MAGs) in insects are pair(s) of internal reproductive organs that produce and secrete the plasma component of seminal fluid. In various insects, MAG size is important for male reproductive success because the fluid provides physiologically active substances and/or nutrients to females to control sperm as well as female reproductive behaviors. Although the MAG epithelial cells in most insect species are standard mononucleate cells, those in some insect taxa are binucleate due to incomplete cytokinesis (e.g., Drosophila [Fall\u00e9n] [Diptera: Drosophilidae]) or cell fusion (e.g., Cimex [Linnaeus] [Hemiptera: Cimicidae]). In the case of Drosophila , the apicobasal position of the two nuclei relative to the epithelial plane changes from vertical to horizontal after nutrient intake, which allows the volume of the MAG cavity to expand effectively. On the other hand, in the case of Cimex , the positions of the two nuclei do not change apicobasally in response to feeding, but their position relative to the proximodistal axis varies depending on the tubular/spherical organ morphology. Here, we report that the MAG of the benthic water bug Aphelocheirus vittatus (Matsumura) (Hemiptera: Aphelochiridae) shows binucleation in all epithelial cells. Despite the phylogenetically close relationship between Aphelocheirus and Cimex , the MAG cells in Aphelocheirus showed a Drosophila -like apicobasal change in the position of the two nuclei in response to feeding. Furthermore, the cytological processes during binucleation are more similar to those in Drosophila (incomplete cytokinesis) than to those in Cimex (cell fusion). These results indicate that the physiological role and mechanism of binucleation in MAG cells changed during the evolution of Hemiptera.",

Feeding disorders require comprehensive assessment and treatment of 4 closely related, complementary domains (medical, psychosocial, and feeding skill-based systems and associated nutritional complications). Previous diagnostic paradigms have, however, typically defined feeding disorders using the lens of a single professional discipline and fail to characterize associated functional limitations that are critical to plan appropriate interventions and improve quality of life. Using the framework of the World Health Organization International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health , a unifying diagnostic term is proposed: \u201cPediatric Feeding Disorder\u201d (PFD), defined as impaired oral intake that is not age-appropriate, and is associated with medical, nutritional, feeding skill, and/or psychosocial dysfunction. By incorporating associated functional limitations, the proposed diagnostic criteria for PFD should enable practitioners and researchers to better characterize the needs of heterogeneous patient populations, facilitate inclusion of all relevant disciplines in treatment planning, and promote the use of common, precise, terminology necessary to advance clinical practice, research, and health-care policy.",

To investigate the heritability of feeding behavior and their genetic correlation with body weight\u2013related traits in Pekin ducks, 5,594 Pekin ducks were selected. The information about body weight\u2013related traits and feeding behavior from 3 to 6\u00a0wk of age were recorded by automatic electronic feeders. The heritability estimates for body weight, residual feed intake, and feeding behavior traits are relatively high (ranging from 0.29 to 0.65). We observed that total feed intake, meal feed intake, body weight at the age of 3\u00a0wk, and daily body weight gain had strong positive genetic correlations with body weight at the age of 6\u00a0wk. Moreover, body weight at the age of 3\u00a0wk also showed a positive genetic correlation with the feed conversion ratio (0.33). Total feeding time, daily feed intake, and feeding rate had significant positive phenotypic correlations with feed efficiency. However, the average interval between meals, the number of daily visits, and the number of meals all had a low genetic or phenotypic relationship with body weight and feed efficiency. In conclusion, our study revealed that body weight, residual feed intake, and feeding behavior traits were all highly heritable traits, and the selection for certain feeding behaviors could improve feed efficiency in Pekin ducks. This study is the first report about genetic parameter estimates about feeding behaviors in ducks based on large datasets and provides solid data for genetic study in ducks.",

MastV5 genome was nearly complete sequenced and characterized. Possible natural spillover of this virus among wild Canidae species was proposed. Astroviruses are a common cause of gastroenteritis in children worldwide and can also cause infection in a range of domestic and wild animal species. Canine astrovirus (formally named as Mamastrovirus 5, MAstV5) has been reported worldwide, and its role as an enteric pathogen is still controversial. Herein, we describe the genomic characterization of a MAstV5 (strain crab-eating fox/2016/BRA) identified in a wild canid ( Cerdocyon thous ) diagnosed with canine distemper virus (CDV) as causa mortis . The nearly complete genome comprised 6579\u2009nt in length and displayed the archetypal organization of astroviruses. The present report is the first evidence of MAstV5 infection in an animal species other than the dog and highlights a possible natural astrovirus spillover between domestic and wild canids. Moreover, these results show the first evidence of extra-intestinal MAstV5, suggesting a virus systemic spread. This work is expected to contribute to a better understanding of the astroviruses biology and their interactions with the wildlife health.",

Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE) is the commonly used animal model of MS. Calorie restriction has been found to reduce inflammation and autoimmune responses and promote neuroprotection. In this study we evaluated the effects of intermittent feeding protocol of the calorie restriction in a mouse model of EAE. Fifty four female mice (C57BL/6) were used in this study. The animals were divided into two dietary groups: ad libitum (AL) (n = 29) with free access to food and water and intermittent feeding (IF) (n = 25) with access to food on alternate days. After 8 weeks, EAE was induced in animals by immunization with MOG antigen (Hooke labs, Lawrence, MA, USA) subcutaneously. AL and IF groups were then further divided into two groups each: AA ( ad libitum until the end of study) (n = 16) and AI (subjected to intermittent feeding regimen after immunization day) (n = 13). The IF group was divided into II (continued intermittent feeding regimen until the end of study) (n = 13) and IA (changed to AL regimen after immunization day) (n = 12). All the animals were behaviorally monitored for 35 days after immunization and observed daily for the signs and severity of disease with EAE scoring scale [0\u20135] and cumulative disease index (CDI) score. Intermittent feeding significantly reduced the incidence of EAE in IF groups (AI 0%, II 18.5%, IA 22.2%, p < 0.05). In addition, intermittent feeding significantly delayed the onset of EAE in AI group (p < 0.05) and also, intermittent feeding significantly reduced the severity of disease in II and IA groups (AA vs. II, p < 0.05 & AA vs. IA p < 0.05) groups. The CDI was also significantly reduced in intermittent feeding fed groups [AI, II and IA compared to AA group (P < 0.05, <0.01, <0.05 respectively)]. Intermittent feeding regimen protocol of the calorie restriction significantly suppressed EAE incidence, induction, and severity. The results of this study suggest possible role of intermittent feeding in the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis patients.",

Our study aims to analyze whether there is a relationship between the duration of breastfeeding and undernutrition among children aged from birth up to 3 years of age in Pakistan. A secondary analysis of the Pakistan Demographic and Health Survey 2013-2014 with 1072 children aged 3 years and under was conducted. The relationship between breastfeeding duration and undernutrition status was estimated through multiple logistic regression analysis. The prevalence of stunting, wasting and underweight were 40.6%, 15.8% and 33.9% respectively, while prevalence of severe stunting is at 22.5%; severe wasting at 4.5% and severe underweight at 12.2% in children in our study. Odds of being stunted were significantly higher for children in their 3rd year of life [AOR: 4.35, CI 95%\u00a0= (2.01, 9.33)] compared to children being breastfed in their 2nd year of life [AOR: 2.43, CI 95%\u00a0= (1.55, 3.79) after being adjusted for maternal, child, demographic and healthcare access variables. Similarly, children being breastfed in their third year of life were more susceptible to developing severe stunting [AOR: 6.19, CI 95%\u00a0= (3.31, 11.56)] in comparison to children in their second year [AOR: 2.84, CI 95%\u00a0= (1.81, 4.46)]. There was no significant association between breastfeeding and wasting/severe wasting, or between breastfeeding and underweight/severe underweight. Breastfeeding in the 2nd and 3rd year of life was found to have significant relationship with stunting and severe stunting. Mothers need to be educated about the risks of prolonged breastfeeding to reduce the burden of undernutrition in the country.",

    "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa is a chronic psychiatric disease defined by severe weight loss, due to fear of obesity, and self-imposed semi-starvation. Of the many complications following anorexia nervosa, low bone mineral density (BMD) is a significant risk factor for fractures. Anorexia nervosa is associated with higher risk of incident fracture in females across all age groups, and in males >40\u200ayears old. Sites at highest risk of fracture include the hip/femur and pelvis in females, and vertebrae in males with anorexia nervosa. A 29-year-old woman known to have suffered from anorexia nervosa 15\u200ayears ago visited the emergency department due to right hip pain after falling while getting out of a taxi. During the period of anorexia nervosa, she had a body mass index (BMI) of 14.06\u200akg/m 2 (weight, 36\u200akg; height, 1.60\u200am) and suffered from amenorrhea. At the time of presentation, she had a BMI of 19.53\u200akg/m 2 (weight, 50\u200akg; height, 1.60\u200am) and had regular menstrual periods, indicating clinical recovery from anorexia nervosa. Plain radiography, computed tomography, and bone scintigraphy revealed AO 31-A2.2 type right hip proximal femur intertrochanteric fracture. The BMD showed a T score of \u22123.9 in the hip and \u22123.6 at the lumbar level, indicating severe osteoporosis. Osteosynthesis was performed with proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA) and wiring. There were no specific symptoms, such as trauma or infection, during postoperative rehabilitation and postoperative management, and she was discharged after 2\u200aweeks. After 1\u200ayear of follow-up at our outpatient clinic, she had no complications. Here, we describe an unusual case of unilateral femoral intertrochanteric fracture that occurred after clinical recovery from anorexia nervosa. This case indicated that the risk of fracture remains even after recovery of BMI. We propose that women who have clinically recovered from anorexia nervosa should be advised to undergo annual osteodensitometric analyses after consulting with specialists in other areas (psychiatry, endocrinology, eating disorders).",

The aim of this study was to use an animal model to assess cisplatin therapy (3 cycles) with and without d -methionine to investigate its protective effects on cisplatin-induced anorexia and skeletal muscle wasting. Wistar rats were divided into 3 groups and treated as follows: saline as control (group 1), intraperitoneal cisplatin once a week for 3 weeks (group 2), and intraperitoneal cisplatin once a week for 3 weeks plus oral administration of d -methionine (group 3). Tissue somatic index (TSI), gastric emptying index (GEI), and feeding efficiency were measured. Both hepatic lipid metabolism and muscle atrophy-related gene expressions and C2C12 myotubes were determined by polymerase chain reaction. Micro\u2013computed tomography (micro-CT) was used to conduct assessment of bone microarchitecture indices. Pathological changes of the gastric mucosa were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining after euthanizing the animals. d -Methionine increased food intake, weight gain, gastric emptying, and feeding efficiency, as well as decrease stomach contents, after cisplatin injections. Cisplatin caused shortening of myofibers. Cisplatin-induced muscle mass wasting was mediated by the elevation of mRNA expressions of MAFbx and MuRF-1 in ubiquitin ligases in muscle tissue homogenate. The mRNA expressions of MyoD and myogenin, markers of muscle differentiation, declined following cisplatin administration. The administration of d -methionine not only led to significant improvements in myofiber diameter and cross-sectional fiber areas but also reversed muscle atrophy-related gene expression. However, there were no significant changes in stomach histology or microarchitecture of trabecular bone among the study groups. The results indicate that d -methionine has an appetite-enhancing effect and ameliorates cisplatin-induced adipose and muscle tissue loss during cisplatin-based chemotherapy.",

Breastmilk is lifesaving, providing not only nutrition but immunologic benefits and as such is strongly supported by the World Health Organization and leading healthcare associations worldwide. When the COVID-19 pandemic started in 2020, the impact of the restrictions to prevent the spread of the disease created challenges and questions about provision of safe, quality care, including breastfeeding practices, in a new \u2018normal\u2019 environment. Mothers were temporarily separated from their babies where infection was present or suspected, parents were prevented from being present on neonatal units and vital breastfeeding support was prevented. This discussion paper provides an overview of essential areas of knowledge related to practice for neonatal nurses and midwives who care for breastfeeding mothers and babies, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and the latest global guidance. Three areas will be discussed; the protective benefits of breastfeeding, keeping breastfeeding mothers and babies together and supporting mothers to breastfeed their babies. Finally, care recommendations are presented to serve as a summary of key points for application to practice for neonatal nurses and midwives.",

Serum Zn concentrations were obtained from healthy controls and from acutely ill and remitted young patients with BN. Mean duration of remission was 4.0\u00b13.5 years. Remitted patients showed elevated serum Zn concentrations when compared to controls (Cohen\u2019s d=2.022), but concentrations were still in the normal range. Acutely ill patients also had higher serum Zn levels when compared to controls (all values still being within the reference range, Cohen\u2019s d=0.882). There was no difference between acutely ill and remitted patients with BN in serum Zn concentrations. Of note, remitted patients had a significantly higher body weight when compared to the other two groups. Overall, there were no significant differences in dietary preferences with regard to Zn containing foods between the groups. The present study provides preliminary evidence that the underlying factors for changes in Zn serum concentrations in young patients with BN do not vary with regard to the stage of illness (acute versus remitted BN). Further prospective research is needed in order to disentangle the possible interplay between serum Zn status and bulimic eating behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Most of the previous studies on problematic pornography use and related behavior have focused on such descriptors of pornography use habits as frequency or time devoted to pornography use. We argue that this constitutes a narrow view and indicators that characterize other aspects of explicit content consumption, namely (i) longest session of pornography viewing (which may be related to binge behavior), as well as (ii) variability of consumed pornographic content, can also be useful indicators. An online study based on a sample of 132 heterosexual men seeking treatment for problematic pornography use, referred by therapists after their initial visit and 437 non-treatment seekers in the control group. The main outcomes of this study are reported longest, non-stop session of viewing pornography, variability in consumed pornographic content (including paraphilic and violent pornography), actual treatment seeking for problematic pornography use and severity of symptoms, and average weekly time devoted to pornography use. Our analysis showed that longest session of viewing pornographic content as well as the variety of consumed pornography influenced the decision to seek treatment and the severity of symptoms even when the sheer amount of time devoted to pornography use was controlled. This is one of the few studies examining the role of engagement in prolonged sessions of pornography use and the variability of consumed pornographic content in the clinical context of problematic sexual behavior. The study's main limitations are its relatively narrow method of operationalization of variability of pornographic content and longest session of pornography viewing, as well as its cross-sectional, online, and anonymous character. As the described factors have an important influence on treatment seeking and the severity of experienced symptoms, they should be considered in the process of assessing compulsive sexual behavior disorder and related symptoms.

The objective of this case study is to provide programme considerations for planning, implementing, monitoring, and evaluating vitamin A and iron deficiency interventions within the context of lessons learned to date for vitamin A supplementation, micronutrient powders (MNPs), and food\u2010based strategies. For 15 years, the Mozambique Ministry of Health implemented twice\u2010yearly vitamin A supplementation through both campaigns and routine health services. Yet coverage in 2017 (55%) was not much higher than in 2003 (44%). Reaching every district/reaching every child, a strategy adapted from the field of immunization, was used to achieve equitable coverage of vitamin A and for microplanning of outreach services in health facilities, with support from the Maternal and Child Survival Program. In Mozambique, a free or subsidized distribution model for MNPs has been rolled out, yet integration of MNPs into infant and young child feeding programming (i.e., cooking demonstrations) is needed to reinforce \u201cthe who, what, and why\u201d of MNPs through culturally sensitive behaviour change communication. Food\u2010based strategies to promote dietary diversity, such as through complementary feeding recipes, are also critical. To harmonize efforts, the Mozambique government should consider the development of a national strategy for the prevention and control of micronutrient malnutrition, with clear monitoring and evaluation targets. Ongoing monitoring of the prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies and coverage of implemented micronutrient interventions is needed to make evidence\u2010based decisions to drive nutrition\u2013health programming.",

    "abstract": "Although it is thought that eating disorders result from the interplay of personal and sociocultural factors, a comprehensive model of eating disorders remains to be established. The aim of this study was to determine the extent to which the childhood factors and deficit in visuoperceptual ability contribute to eating disorders. A total of 76 participants - 22 women with anorexia nervosa (AN), 28 women with bulimia nervosa (BN), and 26 healthy women of comparable age, IQ, and years of education - were examined. Neuropsychological tasks were applied to measure the visuoperceptual deficits, viz. the Rey-Osterrieth complex figure test and the group embedded figures test (GEFT). A questionnaire designed to obtain retrospective assessments of the childhood risk factors was administered to the participants. The women with both AN and BN were less likely to report having supportive figures in their childhood and poor copy accuracy in the Rey-Osterrieth test. The women with AN were more likely to report premorbid anxiety, childhood emotional undereating and showed poor performances in the GEFT. In the final model, the factors independently contributing to the case status were less social support in childhood as a common factor for both AN and BN, and childhood emotional undereating and poor ability in the low-level visuospatial processing for AN. Our results suggest the disturbance in the food-emotion relationship and the deficit in low-level visuospatial processing in people with AN. Lower social support appears to contribute to an increase in vulnerability to both AN and BN.",

However, the absence of enteral nutrition might not be beneficial for the intestine. We aimed to determine the feasibility of minimal enteral feeding (MEF) administration in a methotrexate (MTX)-induced mucositis rat model and thereby determine the effect of MEF on recovery. Male Wistar rats were attached to swivel systems from day\u00a01 to 5 after 45\u00a0mg/kg MTX IV injection. The MTX group continued ad libitum feeding, and the MTX\u2009+\u2009MEF group continued ad libitum feeding and received from day\u00a01 to 5 continuously MEF. MEF consisted of 20\u00a0% of their normal caloric intake. We measured body weight, intake, and plasma citrulline. At day\u00a010, the rats were terminated and villus and crypt length were measured. The administration of MEF caused no increased severity of mucositis phenotype, with comparable caloric intake, body weight, and plasma citrulline during mucositis. The recovery of plasma citrulline levels was not different between both groups. At day\u00a07 and 8, the MTX\u2009+\u2009MEF group gained significantly more weight ( p <\u20090.05 and p <\u20090.01, respectively), and at day\u00a08 and 9 the total caloric intake was significantly increased ( p <\u20090.01 and p <\u20090.05, respectively) compared to the MTX group. At day\u00a010, the rats from the MTX\u2009+\u2009MEF group showed a significant increase in jejunal villus length compared to the MTX group ( p <\u20090.05). This is the first study in which the feasibility of MEF administration during chemotherapy-induced mucositis was determined. This study indicates that MEF administration is feasible during mucositis and suggests that MEF accelerates recovery after MTX-induced mucositis.",

Recent reports showed that MC4R can also control the motivation for food in association with a brain reward system, such as dopamine. We investigated the expression levels of MC4R and the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R), which is known to be related to food rewards, in both the hypothalamus and brain regions involved in food rewards. We examined the expression levels of D2R and MC4R by dual immunofluorescence histochemistry in hypothalamic regions and in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST), the central amygdala, and the ventral tegmental area of transgenic mice expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein under the control of the D2R gene. In the hypothalamic area, significant coexpression of MC4R and D2R was observed in the arcuate nucleus. We observed a significant coexpression of D2R and MC4R in the BNST, which has been suggested to be an important site for food reward. We suggest that MC4R and D2R function in the hypothalamus for control of energy homeostasis and that within the brain regions related with rewards, such as the BNST, the melanocortin system works synergistically with dopamine for the integration of food motivation in the control of feeding behaviors.",

However, this procedure is not well known and the literature available is still fairly limited. This observational study was conducted to evaluate our experience using this method as an alternative long-term tube feeding procedure when gastrostomy is not suitable. A total of 15 patients (10 males and 5 females) who underwent PTEG at our institution from 2012 to 2016 were observed and analyzed in this study. The average age was 80.1 (71\u201393) years. Underlying conditions that required PTEG were previous gastric resection in 11 patients, left diaphragm disorder in 2 patients, interposing transverse colon between the abdominal wall and anterior gastric wall in 1 patient, and severe gastrostomy site leakage in 1 patient. Tube placement was successful in all patients by approaching the left side of the neck, using a 15 Fr size tube. The mean postoperative length of stay was 22 (8\u201348) days. Postoperative adverse events included accidental tube dislodgement in three patients, tracheoesophageal fistula in one patient, inferior thyroid artery injury in one patient and thyroid gland mispuncture in one patient. There was no procedure-related mortality nor mortality at 30 days. Eight patients were discharged with some oral intake. PTEG is feasible in patients requiring long-term tube feeding for whom gastrostomy is unsuitable. It is an effective long-term tube feeding procedure and should be offered as a more comfortable alternative to nasogastric tubing.",

The study was conducted in six villages of Ghaziabad district, Uttar Pradesh, India. A structured interview schedule was used for eliciting information from 151 mothers of infants, aged 6\u201312 months, on CF practices. Data on CF practices were scored using the CFI developed. Measurements of weight and length were taken. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were done using the SPSS software (version 13). The results revealed that the CF practices were suboptimal in the sample. The mean\u00b1standard deviation (SD) CFI scores ranged from a low value of 7.09\u00b13.21 in 6\u20138 months old infants to a comparatively-higher value of 9.69\u00b12.94 in 9\u201312 months old infants. Using the CFI it could be identified that infants (n=151) had poor dietary diversity, with only 31% and 18% of the infants reportedly being fed the recommended number of food-groups during 6\u20138 and 9\u201312 months respectively. The food-frequency scores of the CFI showed that cereals and diluted animal milk were the major food-groups fed to the infants in this setting. Analysis of nutritional status revealed that 24.5% of the infants were stunted (length-for-age [LAZ] <-2SD), 25% were underweight (weight-for-age [WAZ] <-2SD), and 17% were wasted (weight-for-age [WLZ] <-2SD). Significant associations (p<0.05) were observed between the meal-frequency and the dietary diversity of the CFs of infants aged 6\u20138 months and 9\u201312 months and the WAZ and LAZ indices of their nutritional status. On multivariate analysis of factors affecting the LAZ, WAZ and WLZ scores, the CFI was significantly associated (p<0.05) with LAZ whereas maternal education and breastfeeding frequency were significantly (p<0.01) associated with WAZ and WLZ. Per-capita income, parity, and birth-order were the significant (p<0.05) determinants of the CFI. The CFI developed is an exploratory attempt to summarize and quantify the key CF practices into a composite index, which would reflect the CF practices holistically. This index can be used as an easy tool by programme planners for identifying, targeting, and monitoring the deficient CF practices and also advocating the importance of the CF at policy level.",

As anorexia-cachexia syndrome (ACS) is associated with decreased BMI and is frequently observed in patients with advanced RCC, the present study investigated the association of BMI with tumor aggressiveness and prognosis in RCC in relation to ACS. The association of BMI with clinicopathological parameters was analyzed in 503 consecutive patients who underwent surgery for RCC. Kaplan-Meier curves and rates of overall survival (OS) stratified by BMI were also compared in relation to the presence or absence of ACS, defined as the presence of anorexia or malaise, and/or weight loss and/or hypoalbuminemia. Low BMI was significantly associated with high-grade tumors (P=0.0027) and the presence of distant metastasis (P=0.0025), and patients with a lower BMI had significantly shorter OS than those with a higher BMI (P=0.0441). Patients with ACS had a significantly lower BMI (mean, 21.5 kg/m 2 ) than those without ACS (mean, 23.5 kg/m 2 ; P<0.0001) and had significantly shorter OS than those without ACS (P<0.0001). On multivariate analysis, ACS was an independent predictor of short OS [P=0.0089; hazard ratio (HR), 2.21; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.22\u20133.92] and short cancer-specific survival (P=0.0308; HR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.07\u20133.78); however, BMI was not (P=0.5440 and P=0.6804, respectively). In the 413 patients without ACS at initial presentation, BMI was not associated with any clinicopathological parameters or OS (log-rank, P=0.4591). BMI itself was not a predictor of survival in patients without ACS, and the association between low BMI and increased tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis could be due to ACS.",

    "abstract": "The recommendations of most health organisations encourage mothers to keep exclusive breast feeding during the first 6 months and combining breast feeding with complementary feeding at least during the first and second years, due to the numerous immunologic, cognitive developmental and motor skill benefits that breast feeding confers. Although the influence of breast feeding on motor development during childhood has been studied, the findings are inconsistent, and some studies have even reported no effect. This manuscript presents a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis, with the aim of reviewing the relationship between breast feeding and motor skill development in children in terms of duration, exclusivity or non-exclusivity of breast feeding. The search will be conducted using Medline (via PubMed), EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library from inception to December 2019. Observational studies (cross-sectional and follow-up studies) written in English or Spanish that investigate the association between breast feeding and motor development in children will be included. This systematic review and meta-analysis protocol follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols. The Critical Appraisal Checklist for Analytical Cross-Sectional Studies and The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for longitudinal studies will be used to assess the quality of included studies. The effect of breast feeding on motor skill development will be calculated as the primary outcome. Subgroup analyses will be carried out based on the characteristics of motor skill development and the population included. Ethical approval is not required because the data used will be obtained from published studies, and there will be no concerns about privacy. The findings from this study will be relevant information regarding the association of breast feeding with motor development in children and could be used encourage to improve breastfeeding rates.

    "abstract": "As stunting moves to the forefront of the global agenda, there is substantial evidence that behaviour change interventions ( BCI ) can improve infant feeding practices and growth. However, this evidence has not been translated into improved outcomes on a national level because we do not know enough about what makes these interventions work, for whom, when, why, at what cost and for how long. Our objective was to examine the design and implementation of complementary feeding BCI , from the peer\u2010reviewed literature, to identify generalisable key determinants. We identified 29 studies that evaluated BCI efficacy or effectiveness, were conducted in developing countries, and reported outcomes on infant and young children aged 6\u201324 months. Two potential determinants emerged: (1) effective studies used formative research to identify cultural barriers and enablers to optimal feeding practices, to shape the intervention strategy, and to formulate appropriate messages and mediums for delivery; (2) effective studies delineated the programme impact pathway to the target behaviour change and assessed intermediary behaviour changes to learn what worked. We found that BCI that used these developmental and implementation processes could be effective despite heterogeneous approaches and design components. Our analysis was constrained, however, by the limited published data on how design and implementation were carried out, perhaps because of publishing space limits. Information on cost\u2010effectiveness, sustainability and scalability was also very limited. We suggest a more comprehensive reporting process and a more strategic research agenda to enable generalisable evidence to accumulate.",

The results of the experiment on the effect of the developed complete pellet feed on goat production under stall feeding condition demonstrated that feeding complete pellet feeds helped in increasing the daily body weight gain of goats (36.96 and 52.46 gm, respectively) compared to traditional semi-intensive feeding (17.76 gm) with significantly ( p < 0.05) better body condition score of goats. Feed Conversion Ratio was considerably lower (5.7) in the pellet feeding group than in the other groups where no pellet feed was used (8.32 and 8.03).

The objective of the study was to find out how the mode of delivery had impact on the practice of breast feeding. Data were collected for 2500 consecutive patients during a period of two years, and it was seen that maternal initiative to breast feed was low and problems with lactation were much more in cases delivering their babies via cesarean sections than those delivering theirs by normal delivery. Vaginal and cesarean section deliveries took place in 54% and 46% of the case, respectively. Thirty percent of the women studied felt that they had no problems regarding breastfeeding, but 70% of them had some sort of problems with breastfeeding their babies. When the women were matched for the mode of delivery, 58% of women who had breastfeeding problems belonged to the cesarean delivery group and 42% of complaining mothers were from women with normal delivery. The relative risk of having problems with breastfeeding for women subjected to cesarean was 1.38 and the odds ratio was 0.61. The findings of the present study indicate that more in depth counseling sessions are required for women undergoing operative delivery to improve breast feeding among them.",

    "abstract": "Evolutionary theory suggests that commonly found sex differences are largest in healthy populations and smaller in populations that have been exposed to stressors. We tested this idea in the context of men\u2019s typical advantage (vs. women) in visuospatial abilities (e.g., mental rotation) and women\u2019s typical advantage (vs. men) in social-cognitive (e.g., facial-expression decoding) abilities, as related to frequent binge drinking. Four hundred nineteen undergraduates classified as frequent or infrequent binge drinkers were assessed in these domains. Trial-level multilevel models were used to test a priori Sex \u00d7 Group (binge drinking) interactions for visuospatial and social-cognitive tasks. Among infrequent binge drinkers, men\u2019s typical advantage in visuospatial abilities and women\u2019s typical advantage in social-cognitive abilities was confirmed. Among frequent binge drinkers, men\u2019s advantage was reduced for one visuospatial task (\u0394 d = 0.29) and eliminated for another (\u0394 d = 0.75), and women\u2019s advantage on the social-cognitive task was eliminated (\u0394 d = 0.12). Males who frequently engaged in extreme binges had exaggerated deficits on one of the visuospatial tasks, as did their female counterparts on the social-cognitive task. The results suggest sex-specific vulnerabilities associated with recent, frequent binge drinking, and support an evolutionary approach to the study of these vulnerabilities.",

    "abstract": "It is not known whether SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted from mother to infant during breastfeeding, and if so whether the benefits of breastfeeding outweigh this risk. This study was designed to evaluate 1) if SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in milk and on the breast of infected women, 2) concentrations of milk-borne anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and 3) the capacity of milk to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. We collected 37 milk samples and 70 breast swabs (before and after breast washing) from 18 women recently diagnosed with COVID-19. Samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using RT-qPCR. Milk was also analyzed for IgA and IgG specific for the nucleocapsid protein, receptor binding domain (RBD), S2 subunit of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, as well as 2 seasonal coronaviruses using ELISA; and for its ability to neutralize SARS-CoV-2. We did not detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in any milk sample. In contrast, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected on several breast swabs, although only one was considered conclusive. All milk contained SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgG, and levels of anti-RBD IgA correlated with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. Strong correlations between levels of IgA and IgG to SARS-CoV-2 and seasonal coronaviruses were noted. Our data do not support maternal-to-child transmission of SARS-CoV-2 via milk; however, risk of transmission via breast skin should be further evaluated. Importantly, milk produced by infected mothers is a source of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG and neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 activity. These results support recommendations to continue breastfeeding during mild-to-moderate maternal COVID-19 illness.",

This was a systematic review of observational studies on risk factors for eating disorders published in PubMed/PsycInfo/Embase until December 11th, 2019. We recalculated random-effect meta-analyses, heterogeneity, small-study effect, excess significance bias and 95% prediction intervals, grading significant evidence (p < 0.05) from convincing to weak according to established criteria. Quality was assessed with the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews 2 (AMSTAR-2) tool. Of 2,197 meta-analyses, nine were included, providing evidence on 50 risk factors, 29,272 subjects with eating disorders, and 1,679,385 controls. Although no association was supported by convincing evidence, highly suggestive evidence supported the association between childhood sexual abuse and bulimia nervosa (k = 29, 1,103 cases with eating disorders, 8,496 controls, OR, 2.73, 95%CI 1.96-3.79, p = 2.1 x 10-9, AMSTAR-2 moderate quality) and between appearance-related teasing victimization and any eating disorder (k = 10, 1,341 cases with eating disorders, 3,295 controls, OR 2.91, 95%CI 2.05-4.12, p = 1.8x10-9, AMSTAR-2 moderate quality). Suggestive, weak, or no evidence supported 11, 29, and 8 associations, respectively. The most credible evidence indicates that early traumatic and stressful events are risk factors for eating disorders. Larger collaborative prospective cohort studies are needed to identify risk factors for eating disorders, particularly anorexia nervosa.",

The relationship between exclusive breastfeeding and lower risk of childhood obesity has elicited much scientific interest, given the fact that this form of malnutrition is becoming a global epidemic. This narrative review aims to examine the evidence in the literature linking exclusive breastfeeding with reduction in obesity in children. Using appropriate search terms, PubMed database was searched for relevant articles that met the review objective. Evidence for the protective effect of exclusive breastfeeding against childhood obesity have been provided by studies which explored 5 physiologic mechanisms and those that established the causality between breastfeeding and lower risk of obesity. The few studies that disputed this relationship highlighted the influence of confounding factors. A new insight on molecular mechanisms, however, points to a direct and indirect effect of human milk oligosaccharides on the prevention of overweight and obesity. The preponderance of current evidence strongly suggests that exclusivity in breastfeeding can prevent the development of obesity in children.",

Because the mechanism of milk production is complex, detailed research is required on the relationship between lactation and reflexology. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine the effect of reflexology on the volume of milk among mothers with premature infants. This clinical trial was conducted among 50 mothers with premature infants in two groups of 25 patients admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of Alzahra and Shahid Beheshti hospitals of Isfahan, Iran from August 2015 to November 2015. The patients were selected through convenience sampling method and divided into control and reflexology groups through random allocation. In the reflexology group, massage of the sole of the foot and foot was done in six sessions. The control group received regular breastfeeding training. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Repeated-measures analysis of variance test indicated that the mean volume of breast milk in reflexology group ( F = 44.002, p < 0.001) and control group ( F = 43.09, p < 0.001) differed significantly at different times. Independent t -test showed that the mean increase in milk volume from day 1 to day 5 after the intervention compared to before the intervention was significantly higher in the reflexology group compared to the control group 1days after the intervention ( t =5.25, p <0.001), 2 days after the intervention ( t = 4.81, p <0.001), 3 days after the intervention ( t =3.55, p =0.001), 4 days after the intervention ( t = 2.98, p =0.004), 5 days after the intervention ( t = 2.50, p =0.020). The results indicate that reflexology is effective on the volume of milk of mothers, and this low-cost and easy procedure can be used along with regular lactation training.",

The aim of this review was to synthesize the evidence of mothers' experiences of online breastfeeding peer support. An integrative review was conducted. Five electronic databases were searched. Two reviewers independently screened the articles for inclusion. The inclusion criteria were (1) involved original data focusing on mothers' experiences of online breastfeeding peer support, (2) participants who were mothers who were breastfeeding or had experiences of breastfeeding and (3) studies focusing on interaction and communication among mothers through online communities. In total, 14 publications met the inclusion criteria. Breastfeeding mothers turned to online groups when they felt isolated, lacked professional support or preferred online support over face\u2010to\u2010face support. Online breastfeeding peer support was characterized as a virtual community, with easy access, availability and a wealth of resources from actual experiences of mothers. It empowered breastfeeding mothers and resulted in changes in breastfeeding outcomes and perceptions. The positive aspects of online breastfeeding peer support have recently garnered more attention. This review provided baseline data and evidence to supplement and improve the current breastfeeding support system for breastfeeding mothers. The evidence on the effectiveness of online breastfeeding peer support for influencing breastfeeding outcomes remains inconclusive. Further empirical studies with rigorous study designs are warranted.",

Population-based study of individuals living in the northeast region of S\u00e3o Paulo state, Brazil. From May to August 2017, 372 women aged \u226518 years were selected who gave exclusive, predominant or complementary breast feeding up to 23 months postpartum, and who did not have contraindications for the resumption of intercourse. Pregnant women, those diagnosed with mental health problems, users of medications that affect sexual function (antihypertensives, antidepressants or antipsychotics) and women unable to read or understand the instructions for the study were excluded. The breastfeeding women completed the Female Sexual Function Index, the EUROHIS-QOL 8-item index and a questionnaire to collect participants\u2019 sociodemographic, clinical and interpersonal data. A bivariate analysis was performed, and variables with p values<0.20 were analysed by multivariate logistic regression. Sexual dysfunction was present in 58.3% of the study population. Factors significantly associated with female sexual dysfunction (FSD) included placing a low importance on sexual intercourse (adjusted OR [AOR]=2.49, 95% CI=1.22 to 5.09), limited communication with the partner (AOR=2.64, 95%\u2009CI=1.43 to 4.86), decreased frequency of sexual intercourse (AOR=2.17, 95%\u2009CI=1.30 to 3.61) and low quality of life (AOR=2.23, 95%\u2009CI=1.33 to 3.74). The prevalence of FSD appears with a great magnitude in breastfeeding women. The risk factors for sexual dysfunction are biopsychosocial and these findings may lead to improved counselling for prenatal and postnatal care.",

    "abstract": "Given the magnitude of the health and economic burden of inadequate breastfeeding practices in Mexico, there is an urgency to improve breastfeeding practices to increase the health and well-being of children and mothers. The Becoming Breastfeeding Friendly (BBF) Toolbox was recently developed to guide countries in assessing their readiness to and progress with scale-up of breastfeeding protection, promotion, and support and to develop policy recommendations to high-level decision makers. The aim of this study was to document the BBF process in Mexico, which led to evidence-based recommendations for policymakers to improve breastfeeding protection, promotion, and support in the country. We followed the BBF methodology. First, a group of experts, with the use of scientific and gray literature, face-to-face interviews, and their own experience, analyzed and assigned a score to each of the 8 gears from the BBF index and identified scaling-up gaps on the basis of the Breastfeeding Gear Model. Then, we developed and presented evidence-based recommendations to improve breastfeeding protection, promotion, and support. Mexico's BBF score was 1.4 out of a maximum total of 3 points, which indicates that there is a low to moderate scaling-up environment to protect, promote, and support breastfeeding. None of the gears were rated as \u201coutstanding,\u201d and the legislation and policies gear was the only one rated as strong. The BBF initiative is a useful tool for assessing the environment for breastfeeding. The Mexican environment for breastfeeding is weak. On the basis of these results, it is strongly recommended to raise national awareness on breastfeeding, incorporate the Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes in the Mexican legislations, extend maternity leave to 6 mo, and strengthen evidence-based advocacy and hence the political will that is needed to secure stable funding and resources for a successful national strategy for the protection, promotion, and support of breastfeeding in Mexico.",

It is indicated in patients with severe gastroesophageal reflux disease, gastric outlet obstruction, or severe gastric dysfunction or gastroparesis. Several techniques for GJ feeding tube placement have been reported. The most technically challenging part of GJ tube placement is the advancement and optimal positioning of the jejunal extension into the proximal jejunum. A novel modified Seldinger technique was used for endoscopic placement of a percutaneous low-profile GJ tube (14 French). After gastric access was established, a dilator was advanced under endoscopic vision into the pylorus. Under fluoroscopy, a guidewire was threaded through the dilator into the duodenum. The dilator was then removed, and the GJ tube advanced over the guidewire. A total of 12 patients including 9 pediatric and 3 adult underwent the procedure with no complications. The main indication was gastroparesis with oral intolerance of food. The median operative time was 41.5 minutes. All patients tolerated jejunal tube feeding after surgery. The modified Seldinger technique for percutaneous endoscopic GJ tube placement is a safe and efficient procedure in both children and adults. Further studies are necessary to prove its reproducibility in other centers and to compare it to other methods of PEGJ tube placement.",

Cross-sectional study with a random sample of 2826 schoolchildren (7-14 years). Weight and height were measured according to standardized procedures. Data concerning BF and sociodemographic variables were obtained from a questionnaire sent to parents/guardians. Children's nutritional status was evaluated by BMI-for-age z -score for gender (WHO reference curves). Adjusted analyses were performed through logistic regression, considering a possible interaction among variables. Prevalence of obesity was 8.6% (95% CI: 7.6-9.7%) and 55.7% (95% CI: 53.8-57.6%) received breastmilk for \u22656 months. BF was not associated with obesity, even in the adjusted analysis. Stratified analysis according to maternal schooling showed that, in children aged 7-10 years and children whose mothers had 0-8 years of schooling, the chance of obesity was lower among those breastfeed for >1 month, especially among those who received breastmilk for 1-5 months (OR=0.22; 95% CI 0.08-0.62). Among children of women with higher schooling (>8 years), the chance of obesity was 44% lower in those who were breastfed for >12 months ( p -value for interaction <0.01). This interaction was not found in older children (11-14 years). Among children of women with lower schooling, BF for any period longer than 1 month is protective against obesity; however, for a higher maternal schooling, BF for less than 12 months increases the odds of obesity.

    "abstract": "Sialodacryoadenitis (SDA) is a highly contagious common viral infection in rats, akin to mumps in humans. Anorexia occurs during such viral infection. But the pattern of the decrease in food intake (a decrease in either meal size and meal number or both) during spontaneous viral infection has not been previously characterized. We observed the onset of anorexia and an abnormal feeding pattern during an opportunistic SDA viral infection in our rat colony. We thus studied seven male rats. Before the viral infection there was a positive association between food intake and meal number ( P <.05). After infection food intake decreased by 68%. This occurred via a significant decrease in meal size (by 69%) ( P <.05); and a nonsignificant decrease in meal number ( P =.71). This pattern of decreased food intake is similar to that occurring during indomethacin-induced ulcerative ileitis, where we previously measured an increase in plasma tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1. Anorexia in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide administration, which is also linked to plasma TNF-\u03b1, is however, caused only via a decrease in meal number. The differences in the decrease in the feeding pattern between the SDA viral and a bacterial infection suggest that factors other than TNF-\u03b1 alone play a significant role in the mechanism of anorexia during a viral infection.",

    "abstract": "There is consistent evidence that suggests first year students are at risk of weight gain, but the reasons for this vulnerability are still unclear. This study aimed to explore whether the ability to regulate eating behaviours is a predictor of weight and dietary changes in first year undergraduate students. First year undergraduate students from universities situated in London were invited to complete a survey at the beginning of the academic year and at 6-month follow-up. Each survey included the Self-Regulation of Eating Behaviour Questionnaire, food frequency questions, socio-demographic questions and anthropometric questions. Linear and logistic regressions were performed to explore the associations between baseline eating self-regulatory skills and weight and dietary changes. 481 first year undergraduate students took part in the study. Students who entered university with higher eating self-regulatory skills were more likely to maintain or achieve a higher fruit and vegetable (OR\u202f=\u202f1.8, p =\u202f0.007) and a lower sweet and salty snack (OR\u202f=\u202f1.9, p =\u202f0.001) intake over the course of the first 6\u202fmonths in university. Higher baseline eating self-regulatory skills were also related to lower weight changes (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f\u22120.15, p =\u202f0.018) and lower likelihood of gaining 5% initial body weight (OR\u202f=\u202f0.52, p =\u202f0.006) at 6-month. Additionally, self-regulatory skills moderated the relationship between baseline BMI and weight changes (\u03b2\u202f=\u202f\u22120.25, p \u22640.001) and between baseline BMI and 5% weight gain (OR\u202f=\u202f0.82, p =\u202f0.008). Starting university with higher eating self-regulatory skills may help students to maintain or achieve a healthy diet and protect them against substantial weight gain, especially among students with overweight. \u2022 First year students are at risk of weight gain, but the reasons for this vulnerability are still unclear. \u2022 This study indicates that starting university with higher eating self-regulatory skills may help students to maintain or achieve a healthy diet. \u2022 Starting university with higher eating self-regulatory skills may also protect students with overweight against substantial weight gain.

    "abstract": "Feeding behavior is an important aspect of pig husbandry as it can affect protein deposition (PD) in pigs. A decrease in plasma threonine (Thr) levels may influence feed intake (FI) due to amino acid imbalance. We set out to study whether different Thr inclusion rates of 70%, 85%, 100%, 115%, and 130% of the ideal Thr:lysine (Lys) ratio of 0.65 in two different feeding programs (individual precision feeding and group-phase feeding could affect pig feeding behavior and consequently PD. Two 21-d trials were performed in a 2 \u00d7 5 factorial setup (feeding systems \u00d7 Thr levels) with 110 pigs in the growing phase [25.0 \u00b1 0.8 kg of body weight (BW)] and 110 pigs in the finishing phase (110.0 \u00b1 7.0 kg BW), which correspond to 11 pigs per treatment in each trial. Pigs were housed in the same room and fed using computerized feeding stations. The total lean content was estimated by dual x-ray absorptiometry at the beginning (day 1) and the end (day 21) of the trial. Multivariate exploratory factor analysis was performed to identify related variables. Confirmatory analysis was performed by orthogonal contrasts and Pearson correlation analysis. Graphical analysis showed no difference in feeding patterns between feeding systems during the growing or finishing phase. Pigs exhibited a predominant diurnal feeding, with most meals (73% on average) consumed between 0600 and 1800 h. Exploratory factor analysis indicated that feeding behavior was not related to growth performance or PD in growing or finishing pigs. Changes in feeding behavior were observed during the growing phase, where increasing dietary Thr resulted in a linear increase in the FI rate ( P < 0.05). During the finishing phase, the duration of the meal and FI rate increased linearly as dietary Thr increased in the diet ( P < 0.05). These changes in feeding behavior are, however, correlated to BW. In conclusion, the exploratory factor analysis indicated that feeding behavior had no correlation with growth performance or protein and lipid deposition in growing or finishing pigs. Dietary Thr levels and feeding systems had no direct effect on FI.",

The aim of the study was to use data from the NHANES registry from 1999-2002 to analyze the association between obesity and alcohol use. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between alcohol use and obesity. Risk was assessed separately for men and women. Of the 9,193 individuals (49% males), 26.8% of males and 33.6% of females were obese. About 17% of males and 12% of females were never drinkers (less than 12 drinks in their lifetime). After adjusting for age, race, marital status, highest level of education of the individual and spouse, country of origin, annual household income and duration of physical activity in the past 30 days, the odds of obesity were higher in never drinkers compared to ever drinkers in both men and women. Consumption of alcohol for more than 45 days, binge drinking (>5 drinks/day) for more than 90 days and being \u201cever binge drinker\u201d were associated with significantly higher odds of obesity (in both genders) than those who drank for shorter duration or were \u201cnever binge drinkers\u201d. Consumption of alcohol more than the recommended limit for moderate drinking (3 drinks/day in females and 4 drinks/day in males) was associated with increased (OR 1.074, 95% CI 1.072-1.076) and decreased (OR 0.970, 95%CI 0.968-0.972) obesity in females and males respectively.

This study examined the effect of early feeding a high amino acid density diet on performance of broilers under a sub-clinical NE challenge model. Ross 308 broilers ( n =\u00a0576) were assigned to a 2\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02\u00a0\u00d7\u00a02 factorial design with 2 feeding regimes (feed access either within 6\u00a0h post-hatch or after 48\u00a0h post-hatch), 2 diets (control diet or the control diet with an additional 10% digestible amino acids [HAA]) and either presence or absence of NE challenge. Oral administrations of Eimeria species (d 9) and a field strain of Clostridium perfringens (d 14) were used to induce NE. Broiler performance was analysed at d 13, 23, 30 and 35. Intestinal lesion score and bacterial count were analysed on d 16. The NE challenge reduced overall bird performance and induced severe intestinal lesions, without causing notable mortality. At d 23 bird weight was significantly lower ( P <\u00a00.001) in the challenged birds compared with the unchallenged birds, but by d 30 the challenged birds had recovered and challenge no longer had an impact on bird performance. Birds fed the HAA diet had greater body weight by d 35 and heightened Lactobacillus content in the ileum at d 16 ( P <\u00a00.05). Birds that were fed the HAA diet after a period of fasting performed better in terms of feed conversion ratio (FCR) under challenge. The findings from this study suggest there are beneficial effects of feeding high amino acid diets to birds in response to external stresses, such as post-hatch fasting and subclinical NE.",

    "abstract": "Much academic work has argued that alcohol policy in England over the past 25 years can be characterised as neoliberal, particularly in regard to the night-time economy and attempts to address \u201cbinge\u201d drinking. Understanding neoliberalism as a particular \u201cmentality of government\u201d that circumscribes the range of policy options considered appropriate and practical for a government to take, this article notes how the particular application of policy can vary by local context. This article argues that the approach of successive governments in relation to alcohol should be seen as based on a fear and condemnation of the carnivalesque, understood as a time when everyday norms and conventions are set aside, and the world is \u2013 for a limited period only \u2013 turned inside out. This analysis is contrasted with previous interpretations that have characterised government as condemning intoxication and particular forms of pleasure taken in drinking. Although these concepts are useful in such analysis, this article suggests that government concerns are broader and relate to wider cultures surrounding drunkenness. Moreover, there is an ambivalence to policy in relation to alcohol that is better conveyed by the concept of the carnivalesque than imagining simply a condemnation of pleasure or intoxication.",

    "abstract": "Vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) is becoming a prioritized surgical intervention for obese individuals; however, the brain circuits that mediate its effective control of food intake and predict surgical outcome remain largely unclear. We investigated VSG-correlated alterations of the gut-brain axis. In this observational cohort study, 80 patients with obesity were screened. A total of 36 patients together with 26 normal-weight subjects were enrolled and evaluated using the 21-item Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ), MRI scanning, plasma intestinal hormone analysis, and fecal sample sequencing. Thirty-two patients underwent VSG treatment and 19 subjects completed an average of 4-month follow-up evaluation. Data-driven regional homogeneity (ReHo) coupled with seed-based connectivity analysis were used to quantify VSG-related brain activity. Longitudinal alterations of body weight, eating behavior, brain activity, gastrointestinal hormones, and gut microbiota were detected and subjected to repeated measures correlation analysis. VSG induced significant functional changes in the right putamen (PUT.R) and left supplementary motor area, both of which correlated with weight loss and TFEQ scores. Moreover, postprandial levels of active glucagon-like peptide-1 (aGLP-1) and Ghrelin were associated with ReHo of PUT.R; meanwhile, relative abundance of Clostridia increased by VSG was associated with improvements in aGLP-1 secretion, PUT.R activity, and weight loss. Importantly, VSG normalized excessive functional connectivities with PUT.R, among which baseline connectivity between PUT.R and right orbitofrontal cortex was related to postoperative weight loss. VSG causes correlated alterations of gut-brain axis, including Clostridia, postprandial aGLP-1, PUT.R activity, and eating habits. Preoperative connectivity of PUT.R may represent a potential predictive marker of surgical outcome in patients with obesity.",

    "abstract": "Impaired mentalizing, i.e., difficulties in understanding oneself and others in terms of mental states, has been associated with the development of Anorexia Nervosa (AN), mainly among adults. However, few studies have addressed this question in clinical samples of adolescents with AN. Moreover, no study has explored mentalizing abilities among inpatient adolescents presenting with AN and Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD), despite their high comorbidity in a highly relevant age group. This study attempted, for the first time, to further examine differences in mentalizing abilities and to identify specific mentalizing impairments in different psychiatric inpatient groups and healthy adolescents. Using samples of female adolescents aged 12\u201317, comparison analyses were performed between psychiatric inpatient adolescents with AN ( n = 44), BPD ( n = 101), AN+BPD ( n = 48), other psychopathology ( n = 163) and healthy adolescents ( n = 129). Structured and semi-structured clinical interviews, and two experimental tasks were administered to assess AN, BPD and mentalizing, respectively. Comparison analyses showed that patients with BPD and other psychiatric disorders evidenced higher levels of hypermentalizing compared to healthy adolescents. Hypermentalizing was also reported among inpatients with AN+BPD, although to a lesser extent. BPD and AN scores were positively correlated with hypermentalizing responses. Our results suggest that hypermentalizing is a specific mentalization impairment in inpatient adolescents, particularly with BPD and both AN+BPD. Further investigation into the efficacy of mentalization based treatments for adolescents with BPD and AN+BPD is recommended. Prospective studies are needed to assess mentalizing using experimental tasks among adolescents with AN, taking into account the potential influence of temporality and severity of the disorders\u2019 symptoms.",

Food insecurity status during pregnancy was strongly associated with higher levels of stress, disordered eating, and dietary fat intake at 3 and 12 months postpartum; during the postpartum period it was associated with these measures at 12 month postpartum. A significant interaction was found between level of food insecurity and prepregnancy weight status; food insecurity was associated with greater weight and BMI at 12 months only among overweight/obese women.

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and most aggressive form of brain cancer in adults. For decades, the mainstay of therapeutic intervention was based on surgical resection (when safely feasible), followed by radiotherapy (RT). In 2005, data from the landmark EORTC-NCIC trial changed the standard of care treatment for GBM. This phase III trial demonstrated a survival advantage for concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy when added to the standard course of radiation. In the group of patients assigned to radiation plus TMZ, median survival improved from 12.1 months (radiotherapy alone) to 14.6 months, but all the patient finally relapsed on TMZ. In 2015, Tumor Treating Fields (TTF, Optune) became the first FDA-approved device for the treatment of for newly diagnosed GBM. This approval was based on the EF-14 clinical trial results, in which nearly half of the patients treated with Optune in combination with maintenance temozolomide (TMZ) were alive at 2 years compared with 31% of people on TMZ alone. Optune utilize the natural electrical properties of dividing cancer cells to disrupt mitosis and provide continuous antimitotic action against progression of GBM. TTF-treated tumor cells can exit the process of mitosis aberrantly and release cellular stress signals, such as the endoplasmic reticulum chaperonin calreticulin (CRT) and high mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1). CRT is important to induce antitumor immune responses because CRT inhibition decreases immunogenicity. HMGB1, an endogenous chromatin-associated protein released from dying tumor cells, also plays a critical role in the activation of HMGB1-mediated toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) immune signaling. The presence of those signals may facilitate immune activation, and immunogenic induced cell death, and eventually result in tumor destruction. In this presentation, Daniela Bota, MD, PhD, will review the clinical results of Optune in the treatment of GBM, and will discuss the novel biological mechanisms underlying the effects of Optune in controlling tumor growth and promoting the immune responses in GBM.",

Subjective evaluation of sweating was conducted using the Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale and Numeric Rating Scale in 4 body areas: the face, palms, armpits and abdomino-lumbar area. Objective evaluation of sweating was performed using gravimetry. The prevalence of hyperhidrosis in gravimetric measures was 1.12%. In subjective evaluation hyperhidrosis (HDSS 3 or 4) was present in 11.17% of cases. There was no significant difference in subjective evaluation of hyperhidrosis between men and women (15% vs. 9.24%; p = 0.32). In gravimetry men showed a higher perspiration rate on the face (5.85 vs. 3.38; p < 0.05) and in the armpits (17.27 vs. 9.12; p < 0.05). Individuals with body mass index \u2265 25 kg/m 2 reported hyperhidrosis more often (28% vs. 8.44%; p < 0.05); however, in gravimetric evaluation, beside the facial area, no significant differences in above-mentioned groups were observed. There is a discrepancy between subjective and objective methods of evaluating sweating.",

    "abstract": "The research was aimed at studying the efficiency of a nanoscale alloy of copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) to be used as a mineral additive for feeding broiler chickens, compared to inorganic and organic forms of these elements. Biochemical studies of the blood serum were performed using an automated analyzer. The mineral composition was determined by atomic emission and mass spectrometry (MS-ISP). The study was performed on broiler chickens of cross Smena 7 ( n\u00a0= 72) in the conditions of a vivarium. There were 3 treatment groups with 24 chickens in each. Replacing the inorganic form of mineral supplements with the nanosized alloy resulted in a positive productive effect, with a tendency to increasing the content of serum protein. The nanoscale form of metals improved ( P \u2264 0.05) the activity of aminotransferases. At the same time, the liver microstructure of experimental groups is similar to that of the control. There was a moderate plethora and poor polymorphoncellular infiltration around the interlobular triads with a clear morphological organization of the stromal and parenchymal components of the liver. However, the lack of oxidative stress was confirmed by the dynamics of catalase (CT), total superoxide dismutase (T-SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and the concentrations of which did not exceed the reference level. Replacing Cu and Zn sulfates with the nanoscale alloy (group 1) and organic form (group 2) of these elements in the diet of broiler chickens was accompanied by the increasing pool of these elements in the organisms at the end of the experiment. Copper was accumulated throughout the experiment in experimental group 1, compared to the reference, with the maximum difference in the liver of 36.5% ( P \u2264\u00a00.05), in the feathers 2.5 times ( P \u2264\u00a00.01). Assessment of the Zn level dynamics in the feathers revealed a well noticeable tendency to reducing its concentrations during the experiment in all groups. Against the background of feeding a nanoscale alloy, Zn concentration in the liver exceeded the reference by 66.8% ( P \u2264\u00a00.01) only at the end of the experiment. Thus, nanoscale forms of Cu and Zn have a cumulative effect, and may become an alternative to inorganic and organic forms of these elements in poultry nutrition.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to quantify the emissions of enteric CH 4 from growing Hereford steers raised under feedlot conditions based on contrasting levels of residual feed intake (RFI). A repeated measurements experiment was conducted over 20 d to determine CH 4 production from two groups of nine Hereford steers, with contrasting RFI values (mean \u00b1 SD): low RFI (LRFI group; \u22120.78 \u00b1 0.22 kg DMI/d) vs. high RFI (HRFI group; 0.83 \u00b1 0.34 kg DMI/d). Steers were selected from a larger contemporary population in which the RFI was evaluated. Steers were maintained under confined conditions with ad libitum access to water and feed, comprising a total mixed ration of 55% sorghum silage, 21% barley silage, 21% corn grain, and 3% protein\u2013mineral\u2013vitamin\u2013premix, provided twice a day. Before the beginning of CH 4 measurements, the live weight of both groups of animals was determined, which on average (\u00b1SEM) was 357.0 \u00b1 5.11 and 334.0 \u00b1 10.17 kg in the LRFI and HRFI groups, respectively. Methane emission (g/d) was measured on each animal with the sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6 ) tracer technique, during two consecutive periods of 5 d. Individual daily intake and feeding behavior characteristics were measured using a GrowSafe automated feeding system (Model 6000, GrowSafe Systems Ltd, Airdrie, Alberta, Canada). Methanogens in the ruminal content were quantified using quantitative polymerase chain reaction with primers targeting the mcrA gene. Methane emission was near 27% lower in animals with LRFI when expressed in absolute terms (g/d; 26.8%; P = 0.009), by unit of dry matter intake (g CH 4 /kg; 27.9%, P = 0.021), or as % of gross energy intake (26.7%; P = 0.027). These differences could not be explained by differences in amount of total of methanogens (average = 9.82 log 10 units; P = 0.857). However, there were some differences in animal feeding behavior that could explain these differences (e.g., LRFI animals tended to spend less time in feeders). Our results suggest that, in Hereford steers, the selection by RFI values is a promising mitigation strategy for the reduction of the emission of enteric CH 4 .",

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of gastrointestinal conditions in children with severe feeding difficulties. We conducted a retrospective study of 93 children requiring an intensive feeding program. The medical records, radiologic and diagnostic tests, use of gastric tube feedings, preexisting medical conditions, and medications were reviewed. Fifty-two percent (52%) had esophagitis, 26.2% gastritis, and 40.7% lactase deficiency in upper endoscopy. In those who underwent an upper endoscopy, 26% of patients that were also tested for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth were found to be positive. Allergy testing was abnormal in 56.6% of those tested, while 27.5% and 75% had abnormal gastric emptying times and pH impedance results, respectively. Constipation was present in 76.3%. Thirteen of 32 were weaned off tube feedings. We conclude that gastrointestinal conditions are common in children with feeding disorders and should be investigated prior to feeding therapy.",

We aimed to determine the prevalence of dieting and its relationship with eating behavior, body weight, and body mass index (BMI) in college women. This was a cross-sectional survey of female students aged 18\u201335 years (n = 308). Measures included BMI, restraint, disinhibition, hunger, dieting, weight loss, and perceived weight. A high percentage of college females consider themselves overweight or obese, despite having a BMI in the normal range. Dieting was practised by 43%, and 32% were avoiding weight gain, despite 78% having a healthy BMI. Women classified themselves as overweight or obese (27%), while only 11% were actually in these categories. Exercise was a common method of weight loss and positive associations were observed between dieting and BMI. Assessment of eating behavior showed that 27% were classified as high-restraint. Restraint and disinhibition were positively correlated with BMI. Despite the widespread availability of nutrition information, there is incongruity in measured and perceived BMI in young educated women.

A growing body of evidence suggests that NCDs have a complex etiology resulting from the interaction of genetic factors, gender, age, ethnicity, and the environmental factors. It is well-documented that chronic diseases in adulthood origins in early life. In recent years, much attention has been focused on primordial and primary prevention of NCD risk factors. There are many biological and epidemiological studies on beneficial effects of breastfeeding during infancy on chronic diseases in adulthood, particularly on hypertension, obesity, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and cardiovascular diseases. This review article aims to summarize the current literature on the long-term effects of breastfeeding on prevention of NCDs and their risk factors. The current literature is controversial about these effects; however, a growing body of evidence suggests that breastfeeding has protective roles against obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and type II diabetes mellitus during adulthood. In addition to its short-term benefits, encouraging breastfeeding can have long-term beneficial health effects at individual and population levels.",

In the present study, we generated a line of conditional knockout mice lacking functional leptin receptors selectively on dopamine neurons (Lepr DAT-Cre ). These mice exhibit normal body weight and feeding. Behaviorally, Lepr DAT-Cre mice display an anxiogenic-like phenotype in the elevated plus-maze, light-dark box, social interaction and novelty-suppressed feeding tests. Depression-related behaviors in the chronic stress-induced anhedonia, forced swim and tail-suspension tests were not affected by deletion of Lepr in dopamine neurons. In vivo electrophysiological recordings of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) revealed an increase in burst firing in Lepr DAT-Cre mice. Moreover, blockade of D1-dependent dopamine transmission in the central amygdala by local microinjection of the D1 antagonist SCH23390 attenuated the anxiogenic phenotype of Lepr DAT-Cre mice. These findings suggest that leptin receptor signaling in midbrain dopamine neurons has a crucial role for the expression of anxiety and for the dopamine modulation of amygdala function.",

However, none have addressed the missing data problem in nutritional epidemiologic research in South America. Missing data is a frequent problem in breast cancer studies and epidemiological settings in general. Estimates of effect obtained from these studies may be biased, if no appropriate method for handling missing data is applied. We performed Multiple Imputation for missing values on covariates in a breast cancer case-control study of C\u00f3rdoba (Argentina) to optimize risk estimates. Data was obtained from a breast cancer case control study from 2008 to 2015 (318 cases, 526 controls). Complete case analysis and multiple imputation using chained equations were the methods applied to estimate the effects of a Traditional dietary pattern and other recognized factors associated with breast cancer. Physical activity and socioeconomic status were imputed. Logistic regression models were performed. When complete case analysis was performed only 31% of women were considered. Although a positive association of Traditional dietary pattern and breast cancer was observed from both approaches (complete case analysis OR=1.3, 95%CI=1.0-1.7; multiple imputation OR=1.4, 95%CI=1.2-1.7), effects of other covariates, like BMI and breastfeeding, were only identified when multiple imputation was considered. A Traditional dietary pattern, BMI and breastfeeding are associated with the occurrence of breast cancer in this Argentinean population when multiple imputation is appropriately performed. Multiple Imputation is suggested in Latin America\u2019s epidemiologic studies to optimize effect estimates in the future.",

The selection of articles was based on preestablished inclusion and exclusion criteria. A total of 24 articles were selected for data extraction. There was a predominance of studies that used nonexperimental and descriptive designs, and which were published in international journals. This review provided evidence of the fact that fully consolidated literature regarding social support and social networks in patients with ED is not available, given the small number of studies dedicated to the subject. We identified evidence that the family social network of patients with ED has been widely explored by the literature, although there is a lack of studies about other networks and sources of social support outside the family. The evidence presented in this study shows the need to include other social networks in health care. This expansion beyond family networks would include significant others \u2013 such as friends, colleagues, neighbors, people from religious groups, among others \u2013 who could help the individual coping with the disorder.

    "abstract": "Despite the anti-proliferative and survival benefits from tumor treating fields (TTFields) in human glioblastoma (hGBM), little is known about the effects of this form of alternating electric fields therapy on the aberrant glycolysis of hGBM. [ 18 F]FDG is the most common radiotracer in cancer metabolic imaging, but its utility in hGBM is impaired due to high glucose uptake in normal brain tissue. With TTFields, radiochemistry, Western blot, and immunofluorescence microscopy, we identified pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) as a biomarker of hGBM response to therapeutic TTFields. We used [ 18 F]DASA-23, a novel radiotracer that measures PKM2 expression and which has been shown to be safe in humans, to detect a shift away from hGBM aberrant glycolysis in response to TTFields. Compared to unexposed hGBM, [ 18 F]DASA-23 uptake was reduced in hGBM exposed to TTFields (53%, P < 0.05) or temozolomide chemotherapy (33%, P > 0.05) for 3 d. A 6-d TTFields exposure resulted in a 31% reduction ( P =\u202f0.043) in 60-min uptake of [ 18 F]DASA-23. [ 18 F]DASA-23 was retained after a 10 but not 30-min wash-out period. Compared to [ 18 F]FDG, [ 18 F]DASA-23 demonstrated a 4- to 9-fold greater uptake, implying an improved tumor-to-background ratio. Furthermore, compared to no-TTFields exposure, a 6-d TTFields exposure caused a 35% reduction in [ 18 F]DASA-23 30-min uptake compared to only an 8% reduction in [ 18 F]FDG 30-min uptake. Quantitative Western blot analysis and qualitative immunofluorescence for PKM2 confirmed the TTFields-induced reduction in PKM2 expression. This is the first study to demonstrate that TTFields impairs hGBM aberrant glycolytic metabolism through reduced PKM2 expression, which can be non-invasively detected by the [ 18 F]DASA-23 radiotracer.",

Mechanisms of iron absorption are similar to those of other divalent metals, particularly manganese, lead, and cadmium, and a diet deficient in iron can lead to excess absorption of manganese, lead, and cadmium. Iron deficiency may lead to cognitive impairments resulting from the deficiency itself or from increased metal concentrations caused by the deficiency. Iron deficiency combined with increased manganese or lead concentrations may further affect neurodevelopment. We recently showed that blood manganese and lead concentrations are elevated among iron-deficient infants. Increased blood manganese and lead levels are likely associated with prolonged breast-feeding, which is also a risk factor for iron deficiency. Thus, babies who are breast-fed for prolonged periods should be given plain, iron-fortified cereals or other good sources of dietary iron.",

After controlling for confounders, the inverse association between fetuin-A and HEI-2010 remained significant in the subjects with T2D (\u03b2 = \u22120.386; p < 0.001), 107 healthy controls (\u03b2 = \u22120.237; p = 0.028), and all subjects (\u03b2 = \u22120.298; p < 0.001). In conclusion, the present results suggested that higher quality diet assessed by HEI-2010 associates with lower serum fetuin-A levels in people with and without T2D. More studies are needed to confirm these findings.",

    "abstract": "Infant and young child feeding (IYCF) practices are multidimensional and change rapidly in short intervals in the 1 st year of life, asking for simultaneous assessment of various feeding dimensions in children of 6 months and older. Infant and Child Feeding Index (ICFI) is a composite index which measures complete feeding practices for infants and young children. The present study was conducted to assess IYCF practices for children aged 6\u201336 months in terms of ICFI and some sociodemographic factors and find out the association of ICFI with nutritional status. A cross-sectional study was conducted from July 2015 to October 2015 in Girdharnagar ward of Ahmedabad. Two hundred and ten mother\u2013child pairs were selected by two-staged cluster sampling and were interviewed using a schedule adapted from Knowledge, Practices, and Coverage 2000+ model questionnaire. Appropriate anthropometric measurements were taken and nutritional indicators were calculated. Chi-square test, t- test, and regression analysis were applied wherever required. Epi info version 7.0 and MS Excel 2007 were used for statistical analysis. Nearly 65.2% of the children were stunted, 43.3% were underweight, and 11.9% were wasted. Only 38.3% of the children were initiated on breastfeeding within 1 h of birth. Only 19.1% of the children were breastfed for 2 years and beyond. Meal frequency was adequate in 64.3% and dietary diversity of >4 food groups was given to only 15.7% of the children. Significant higher proportions of children with low ICFI scores had illiterate mothers, were older, and belonged to lower socioeconomic strata. There was statistically significant association of ICFI with all the three nutritional status indicators. Higher proportion of children with lower ICFI scores had lower weight-for-height Z-scores, weight-for-age Z-scores, and height-for-age Z-scores. The present study revealed that ICFI can be used to measure IYCF practices in a single composite index, which in turn can reflect the nutritional status of the children.",

    "abstract": "To study the incidence, etiology and risk factors associated with ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) in children. This prospective cohort study was conducted on patients admitted to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) of a tertiary care institute of North India, from June 2012 through March 2014, who received mechanical ventilation for more than 24\u00a0h. All enrolled children were assessed daily for development of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) using the case definition given by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Chest radiograph and microbiologic samplings were performed in children suspected to have VAP. Risk factors associated with VAP were calculated by doing bivariate and multivariate analysis. A total of 128 patients were screened and 86 were enrolled (median age 30\u00a0mo 95% CI 4.0\u201384.0; 72% boys). The most common admitting diagnosis was sepsis (16%) followed by acyanotic congenital heart disease with pneumonia (14%) and the most common indication for ventilation was respiratory failure (45.3%). The incidence of VAP according to CDC criteria was 38.4%, while the incidence of microbiologically confirmed VAP was 24.4%. The incidence of ventilator associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) was found to be 11.6%. Acinetobacter was the most frequently isolated organism (47%) followed by Pseudomonas (28%), Klebsiella (15%), E. coli (5%) and Enterobacter (5%). Risk factors for VAP on bivariate analysis were use of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) ( p =\u20090.027, OR 5.2, 95% CI 1.1\u201324.3), enteral feeding ( p <\u20090.001, OR 6.5, 95% CI 2.1\u201319.4) and re-intubation ( p =\u20090.024, OR 3.3 and 95% CI 1.1\u20139.6). On multivariate analysis, use of PPI ( p =\u20090.03, OR 8.47, 95% CI 1.19\u201360.33) and enteral feeding ( p <\u20090.001, OR 12.2, 95% CI 2.58\u201357.78) were identified as independent risk factors for VAP. Ventilator associated pneumonia is an important complication in children receiving mechanical ventilation in PICU and Gram negative bacilli ( Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas ) being the important causative agents. Ventilator associated tracheobronchitis is an emerging entity; recognition and treatment of same might prevent the development of VAP.

    "abstract": "The objective of present study was to investigate the effect of cooking and their combinations with re-heating methods on the formation of cholesterol oxidation products (COPs) in stored chicken thigh meat. Pan roasting, steaming, oven grilling, charcoal grilling, and microwaving were used for cooking. Re-heating of samples was done using the same cooking methods or microwaving after 3 and 6 d of refrigerated storage. Cooking and re-heating resulted in reduction of crude fat and cholesterol contents of chicken thigh meat depending on storage period before re-heating. Cooking and storage period had no influence on the total amount of COPs. The highest total amount of COPs was observed in meat samples cooked by steaming and reheated by microwaving after 6 d of storage, which showed similar value to raw chicken meat stored for 6 days. However, different re-heating methods formed different types of COPs depending on storage period before re-heating. The high amount ( p <0.05) of 25-hydroxycholesterol or \u03b1-epoxide was detected in meat samples reheated by steaming or microwaving at 3 or 6 d of storage after steamed cooking, respectively. As a result, the combination of steaming and re-heating with microwaving could increase the total amount of COPs in chicken thigh meat and different cooking/re-heating methods could form different types of COPs, even though no significant difference in the total amount of COPs depending on storage period.",

In addition, we assessed the differential predictive capacity of clinical and personality variables in relation to diagnostic subtype. The sample comprised 998 subjects diagnosed according to DSM-IV-TR criteria: 101 patients were diagnosed with SUD, 482 with GD, 359 with BN, 11 with GD\u2009+\u2009SUD, and 45 patients with BN\u2009+\u2009SUD. Various assessment instruments were administered, as well as other clinical measures, to evaluate their predictive capacity. Marked differences in personality traits were observed between groups. Novelty seeking, harm avoidance, self-directedness, cooperation, and self-transcendence best differentiated the groups. Notably, novelty seeking was significantly higher in the two dual pathology subgroups. Patients with dual pathology showed the most dysfunctional personality profiles.

    "abstract": "Female mosquitoes require blood meals for egg development. The saliva of blood feeding arthropods contains biochemically active molecules, whose anti-hemostatic and anti-inflammatory properties facilitate blood feeding on vertebrate hosts. While transcriptomics has presented new opportunities to investigate the diversity of salivary proteins from hematophagous arthropods, many of these proteins remain functionally undescribed. Previous transcriptomic analysis of female salivary glands from Culex quinquefasciatus, an important vector of parasitic and viral infections, uncovered a 12-member family of putatively secreted proteins of unknown function, named the Cysteine and Tryptophan-Rich (CWRC) proteins. Here, we present advances in the characterization of two C.\u00a0quinquefasciatus CWRC family members, CqDVP-2 and CqDVP-4, including their enrichment in female salivary glands, their specific localization within salivary gland tissues, evidence that these proteins are secreted into the saliva, and their native crystal structures, at 2.3\u00a0\u200b\u00c5 and 1.87\u00a0\u200b\u00c5, respectively. The \u03b2-trefoil fold common to CqDVP-2 and CqDVP-4 is similar to carbohydrate-binding proteins, including the B subunit of the AB toxin, ricin, from the castor bean Ricinus communis . Further, we used a glycan array approach, which identifies carbohydrate ligands associated with inflammatory processes and signal transduction. Glycan array 300 testing identified 100 carbohydrate moieties with positive binding to CqDVP-2, and 77 glycans with positive binding to CqDVP-4. The glycan with the highest relative fluorescence intensities, which exhibited binding to both CqDVP-2 and CqDVP-4, was used for molecular docking experiments. We hypothesize that these proteins bind to carbohydrates on the surface of cells important to host immunology. Given that saliva is deposited into the skin during a mosquito bite, and acts as the vehicle for arbovirus inoculation, understanding the role of these proteins in pathogen transmission is of critical importance. This work presents the first solved crystal structures of C. quinquefasciatus salivary proteins with unknown function. These two molecules are the second and third structures reported from salivary proteins from C. quinquefasciatus , an important, yet understudied disease vector.

    "abstract": "The Baby\u2010Friendly Community Initiative (BFCI) is an extension of the 10th step of the Ten Steps of Successful Breastfeeding and the Baby\u2010Friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) and provides continued breastfeeding support to communities upon facility discharge after birth. BFCI creates a comprehensive support system at the community level through the establishment of mother\u2010to\u2010mother and community support groups to improve breastfeeding. The Government of Kenya has prioritized community\u2010based programming in the country, including the development of the first national BFCI guidelines, which inform national and subnational level implementation. This paper describes the process of BFCI implementation within the Kenyan health system, as well as successes, challenges, and opportunities for integration of BFCI into health and other sectors. In Maternal and Child Survival Program (MCSP) and UNICEF areas, 685 community leaders were oriented to BFCI, 475 health providers trained, 249 support groups established, and 3,065 children 0\u201312\u00a0months of age reached (MCSP only). Though difficult to attribute to our programme, improvements in infant and young child feeding practices were observed from routine health data following the programme, with dramatic declines in prelacteal feeding (19% to 11%) in Kisumu County and (37.6% to 5.1%) in Migori County from 2016 to 2017. Improvements in initiation and exclusive breastfeeding in Migori were also noted\u2014from 85.9% to 89.3% and 75.2% to 92.3%, respectively. Large gains in consumption of iron\u2010rich complementary foods were also seen (69.6% to 90.0% in Migori, 78% to 90.9% in Kisumu) as well as introduction of complementary foods (42.0\u201383.3% in Migori). Coverage for BFCI activities varied across counties, from 20% to 60% throughout programme implementation and were largely sustained 3\u00a0months postimplementation in Migori, whereas coverage declined in Kisumu. BFCI is a promising platform to integrate into other sectors, such as early child development, agriculture, and water, sanitation, and hygiene.",

    "abstract": "Theoretical models and recent advances in the treatment of anorexia nervosa (AN) have increasingly focused on the role of alterations in the processing and regulation of emotions. To date, however, our understanding of these changes is still limited and reports of emotional dysregulation in AN have been based largely on self-report data, and there is a relative lack of objective experimental evidence or neurobiological data. The current functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study investigated the hemodynamic correlates of passive viewing and voluntary downregulation of negative emotions by means of the reappraisal strategy detachment in AN patients. Detachment is regarded as adaptive regulation strategy associated with a reduction in emotion-related amygdala activity and increased recruitment of prefrontal brain regions associated with cognitive control processes. Emotion regulation efficacy was assessed via behavioral arousal ratings and fMRI activation elicited by an established experimental paradigm including negative images. Participants were instructed to either simply view emotional pictures or detach themselves from feelings triggered by the stimuli. The sample consisted of 36 predominantly adolescent female AN patients and a pairwise age-matched healthy control group. Behavioral and neuroimaging data analyses indicated a reduction of arousal and amygdala activity during the regulation condition for both patients and controls. However, compared with controls, individuals with AN showed increased activation in the amygdala as well as in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) during the passive viewing of aversive compared with neutral pictures. These results extend previous findings indicative of altered processing of salient emotional stimuli in AN, but do not point to a general deficit in the voluntary regulation of negative emotions. Increased dlPFC activation in AN during passive viewing of negative stimuli is in line with the hypothesis that the disorder may be characterized by excessive self-control. Taken together, the data seem to suggest that reappraisal via detachment may be an effective strategy to reduce negative arousal for individuals with AN. \u2022 First study to investigate neural correlates of negative emotion regulation in AN. \u2022 No group differences in arousal or neural activity during emotion regulation. \u2022 Increased reactivity to negative pictures in the amygdala and dlPFC in AN. \u2022 Hyperreactivity in the dlPFC may indicate altered mechanisms of cognitive control.

Objective : This study aimed to assess the prevalence and time of occurrence of TEs in the two subtypes of anorexia nervosa (AN; restricting [RAN] and binge-purging [BPAN]) and to investigate differences in TEs (number, type, frequency) as well as clusters of post-traumatic symptoms and emotional dysregulation between the two groups. Method : Seventy-seven hospitalized women were recruited and divided into two subgroups according to their AN subtype. Participants completed the following self-reported measures: Eating Disorder Inventory-2 (EDI-2), Life Events Checklist (LEC), Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS). Results : A higher occurrence of TEs was found in patients with BPAN than in those with RAN. In particular, there were significantly more women in the BPAN group than in the RAN group who had been sexually assaulted. Exposure to TEs happened before the onset of illness in most patients, regardless of the AN subtype. Finally, the BPAN group had significantly higher scores in terms of post-traumatic symptoms and emotional dysregulation than RAN patients. Conclusions : Patients with BPAN showed a higher occurrence of TEs, post-traumatic symptom clusters, and emotional dysregulation than those with RAN. These findings are of interest as treatments could benefit from trauma-informed interventions for those affected by AN, and particularly for those with the binge-purging subtype.",

    "abstract": "This study investigated physiological and behavioral responses associated with the onset of neonatal calf diarrhea (NCD) in calves experimentally infected with rotavirus and assessed the suitability of these responses as early disease indicators. The suitability of infrared thermography (IRT) as a noninvasive, automated method for early disease detection was also assessed. Forty-three calves either (1) were experimentally infected with rotavirus (n = 20) or (2) acted as uninfected controls (n = 23). Health checks were conducted on a daily basis to identify when calves presented overt clinical signs of disease. In addition, fecal samples were collected to verify NCD as the cause of illness. Feeding behavior was recorded continuously as calves fed from an automated calf feeder, and IRT temperatures were recorded once per day across 5 anatomical locations using a hand-held IRT camera. Lying behavior was recorded continuously using accelerometers. Drinking behavior at the water trough was filmed continuously to determine the number and duration of visits. Respiration rate was recorded once per day by observing flank movements. The effectiveness of inoculating calves with rotavirus was limited because not all calves in the infected group contracted the virus; further, an unexpected outbreak of Salmonella during the trial led to all calves developing NCD, including those in the healthy control group. Therefore, treatment was ignored and instead each calf was analyzed as its own control, with data analyzed with respect to when each calf displayed clinical signs of disease regardless of the causative pathogen. Milk consumption decreased before clinical signs of disease appeared. The IRT temperatures were also found to change before clinical signs of disease appeared, with a decrease in shoulder temperature and an increase in side temperature. There were no changes in respiration rate or lying time before clinical signs of disease appeared. However, the number of lying bouts decreased and lying bout duration increased before and following clinical signs of disease. There was no change in the number of visits to the water trough, but visit duration increased before clinical signs of disease appeared. Results indicate that milk consumption, IRT temperatures of the side and shoulder, number and duration of lying bouts, and duration of time spent at the water trough show potential as suitable early indicators of disease.",

    "abstract": "Cucurbitacins are feeding stimulants for diabroticite beetles, including corn rootworms and cucumber beetles, which can be added to a bait containing an insecticide thereby reducing the levels of other insecticide treatments needed to control these pests. One of them, cucurbitacin E-glycoside, is water soluble and easily processed from mutant bitter Hawkesbury watermelons (BHW) that express elevated levels of cucurbitacin. Storage of BHW extract at room temperature resulted in a 92% reduction of cucurbitacin E-glycoside over two months, while refrigeration or freezing resulted in a 60% loss of the active ingredient during this time. The loss of the active ingredient was correlated with an increase in BHW extract pH from 5 to greater than 9. The increase in pH of the BHW extracts at room temperature appeared to be due to the growth of certain bacteria, especially Bacillus  spp . In refrigerated extracts, the pH remained relatively constant, and bacterial growth was dominated by bacteria such as Lactobacilli . An alternative to refrigeration is concentration of BHW extract. One means of concentration is spray drying, but the high sugar content of the BHW extract (20mg/ml glucose, 40mg/ml fructose) makes this technique impractical. Fermentation of the BHW extract by the yeast, Saccharomyces boulardii , eliminated the sugars and did not raise the pH nor alter the cucurbitacin E-glycoside content of the extract. Elimination of the sugars by fermentation produced an extract that could be successfully spray dried. BHW extract fermented by S. boulardii produced a higher level of feeding stimulation for spotted cucumber beetles in laboratory choice tests. When applied to cucumbers, there was no difference in control of spotted and striped cucumber beetles between baits of fresh or fermented juices combined with the same insecticide.",

For glucose and trehalose, we uncover relatively weak preference. In contrast, for fructose and sucrose, preference responses are strong and the effects on feeding pronounced. Specifically, larvae are attracted to, and feeding is stimulated most strongly for, intermediate concentrations of either sugar: Using very high concentrations (4 M) results in weakened preference and suppression of feeding. In contrast to such an optimum function regarding choice and feeding, an asymptotic dose\u2013effect function is found for reinforcement learning: Learning scores reach asymptote at 2 M and remain stable for a 4-M concentration. A similar parametric discrepancy between the reflexive (choice and feeding) and reinforcing function is also seen for sodium chloride (Niewalda T, Singhal S, Fiala A, Saumweber T, Wegener S, Gerber B, in preparation). We discuss whether these discrepancies are based either on inhibition from high-osmolarity sensors upon specifically the reflexive pathways or whether different sensory pathways, with different effective dose\u2013response characteristics, may have preferential access to drive either reflex responses or modulatory neurons mediating internal reinforcement, respectively.",

    "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emerged and rapidly spread worldwide. Several countries have imposed lockdown and isolation in attempt to mitigate viral spread. However, social isolation has a negative effect on psychological aspects, increasing stress, fear, anxiety, anger and emotional disturbance, as well as affecting sleep pattern and the practice of physical activity. Negative emotions and lifestyle changes trigger overeating, consequently affecting dietary practices. The aim of this study was to verify the prevalence of lifestyle factors (i.e., sleep time/quality and practice of physical exercise), eating behavior dimensions, chronotype, and association with dietary practices (planning, domestic organization, food choice, ways of eating) in home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. This cross-sectional study was conducted between April 27 and May 25, 2020. An anonymous online questionnaire (Microsoft Forms) was used for data collection by the snowball method. We verified dietary practices (outcome), eating behavior, physical exercise practice, sleep quality and duration, and chronotype (exposure variables). Sex, age, educational and social status were assessed as covariates and confounders. We evaluated 724 adults (585 women and 139 men). Mean age was 32.6 y (\u00b111.3) for women and 33.5 y (\u00b110.5) for men. Emotional eating (EE) and binge eating (BE) were positively correlated ( r =\u00a00.66; P <0.001). Dietary practices were negatively correlated with BE ( r =\u00a0\u20130.41; P <0.001), EE ( r =\u00a0\u20130.33; P <0.001) and body mass index ( r =\u00a0\u20130.24; P <0.001).

Case series Tajiri Thyroid Clinic, Japan One hundred infants of lactating mothers with GD treated with potassium iodide (KI) for thyrotoxicosis Infant blood thyrotropin (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) levels were measured by the filter paper method. Subclinical hypothyroidism was defined as TSH \u226510 \u03bcIU/mL and \u22655 \u03bcIU/mL in infants aged <6 and \u22656 months, respectively. Overall, 210 blood samples were obtained from 100 infants. The median infant age was 5 (range, 0-23) months; median maternal KI dose, 50 (4-100) mg/day; median blood TSH level, 2.7 (0.1-12.3) \u03bcIU/mL; and median blood FT4 level, 1.04 (0.58-1.94) ng/dL. Blood TSH level was normal in 88/100 infants. Twelve infants had subclinical hypothyroidism; among them, blood TSH levels normalized after maternal KI withdrawal or stopping breastfeeding in 3 infants. In 7 infants, blood TSH levels normalized during KI administration without stopping breastfeeding. Two infants could not be followed up. In Japan, inorganic iodine therapy for lactating women with GD did not affect thyroid function in most of the infants. Approximately 10% of infants had mild subclinical hypothyroidism, but blood TSH level normalized during continued or after discontinuing iodine exposure in all followed up infants.",

Her history was consistent with systemic infections and she tested serologically positive to Borrelia burgdorferi, Babesia microti , and Mycoplasma pneumoniae ; in addition, her clinical presentation was consistent with a Bartonella infection. After treatment with oral and intravenous antimicrobials, she stopped food restriction and no longer had body image concerns. Physicians should be aware of the possibility that tick-borne infections could underly a diagnosis of AN. The role of tick-borne infections in the etiology of AN warrants further study.",

    "abstract": "Dental caries (decay) is an international public health challenge, especially amongst young children. Early childhood caries (ECC) is a serious public health problem in both developing and industrialized countries. ECC can begin early in life, progresses rapidly in those who are at high risk, and often goes untreated. Its consequences can affect the immediate and long-term quality of life of the child's family and can have significant social and economic consequences beyond the immediate family as well. ECC can be a particularly virulent form of caries, beginning soon after dental eruption, developing on smooth surfaces, progressing rapidly, and having a lasting detrimental impact on the dentition. Children experiencing caries as infants or toddlers have a much greater probability of subsequent caries in both the primary and permanent dentitions. The relationship between breastfeeding and ECC is likely to be complex and confounded by many biological variables, such as mutans streptococci, enamel hypoplasia, intake of sugars, as well as social variables, such as parental education and socioeconomic status, which may affect oral health. Unlike other infectious diseases, tooth decay is not self-limiting. Decayed teeth require professional treatment to remove infection and restore tooth function. In this review, we give detailed information about ECC, from its diagnosis to management.",

    "abstract": "Congenital duodenal obstruction is typically treated by duodenoduodenostomy. Tapering of the dilated segment has been indicated to reduce duodenal dysmotility. The purpose of this study was to review the outcomes between these two approaches. We retrospectively reviewed cases of duodenal obstruction repair performed at a quaternary care referral pediatric hospital from 2007 to 2017. The length of stay, time to full enteral feeding, and complications were compared between patients who underwent duodenoduodenostomy with and without tapering duodenoplasty (n=4 and n=35, respectively). Both groups had similar times to initial enteral feeding (7 days) and full enteral feeding (14 vs. 15 days). Among the 35 patients who underwent duodenoduodenostomy alone, 6 (17%) required a return to the operating room; in contrast, no patients who underwent tapering required a return to the operating room. Of those who returned to the operating room, two underwent tapering at that time because of duodenal dilation and feeding intolerance. Although limited by the small sample size, this study suggests that patients undergoing tapering duodenoplasty may have a slightly shorter time to full enteral feeding and a lower rate of complications than patients undergoing duodenoduodenostomy alone.",

Survival of patients with glioblastoma remains poor, with only 1 in 4 patients alive at 2 years, and a 5-year survival rate of about 5%. Recurrence is nearly universal and, after recurrence, prognosis is poor with very short progression-free survival and overall survival (OS). Various salvage chemotherapy strategies have been applied with limited success. Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) are a novel treatment modality approved for treatment of either newly diagnosed or recurrent GBM. TTFields therapy involves a medical device and transducer arrays to provide targeted delivery of low intensity, intermediate frequency, alternating electric fields to produce antimitotic effects selective for rapidly dividing tumor cells with limited toxicity. In the phase 3 EF-14 trial, TTFields plus temozolomide provided significantly longer progression-free survival and OS compared with temozolomide alone in patients with newly diagnosed GBM after initial chemoradiotherapy. The addition of TTFields to standard therapy improved median OS from 15.6 to 20.5 months ( P =0.04). In the phase 3 EF-11 trial, for recurrent GBM, TTFields provided comparable efficacy as investigator\u2019s choice systemic therapy, with improved patient-reported quality of life and a lower incidence of serious adverse events. Primary toxicity associated with TTFields is skin irritation generally managed with array relocation and topical treatments including antibiotics and steroids. TTFields therapy has demonstrated proven efficacy in management of GBM, including improvement in OS for patients with newly diagnosed GBM, and is under current investigation in other brain and extracranial tumors.",

    "abstract": "The study examined the association of vehicle seating positions with the risk of death in serious motor vehicle crashes ( MVC s) in Japan. Data from the Japan Trauma Data Bank between 2004 and 2015 were analyzed. All MVC drivers with the legal age for driving and all copassengers were enrolled ( n =\u00a023,040). The cases were divided into three groups based on their seating position during the crash: the driver seat, front passenger seat, and rear passenger seats. The primary outcome variable was in\u2010hospital mortality. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between the seating position and in\u2010hospital mortality. Potential factors associated with each seating position and in\u2010hospital mortality were also assessed. The odds ratios ( OR s) for deaths were estimated for front and rear passengers compared to those for the driver in MVC s. The adjusted OR s (95% confidence interval [CI]) for death were 0.96 (0.84\u20131.11) and 1.22 (1.04\u20131.42) for front and rear passengers, respectively. Factors significantly associated with MVC deaths were age over 71\u00a0years ( OR =\u00a03.38; 95% CI , 2.58\u20134.41), male gender ( OR =\u00a01.54; 95% CI , 1.39\u20131.71), and night driving ( OR =\u00a01.17; 95% CI , 1.06\u20131.29). This hospital\u2010based study suggested that rear seating increased the risk of MVC \u2010related death. Further studies are needed in order to find mechanisms of the increase in mortality by the seating position. We found that the risk of death is higher in rear seat passengers compared to the driver and front copassenger. The risk of mortality was higher in those who were more than 71\u00a0years of age, irrespective of the seating position. Only in the driver seat position, the male group or those motor vehicle crashes that occurred at night time had a significantly higher risk of death. ",

    "abstract": "Latinos are the largest and most rapidly growing minority population group in the USA and are disproportionally affected by obesity and related chronic diseases. Child care providers likely influence the eating and physical activity behaviours of children in their care, and therefore are important targets for interventions designed to prevent childhood obesity. Nonetheless, there is a paucity of research examining the behaviours of family child care home (FCCH) providers and whether they model healthy eating and physical activity behaviours. Therefore, this study explored Latino FCCH providers\u2019 beliefs and practices related to healthy eating, physical activity and sedentary behaviours, and how they view their ability to serve as role models for these behaviours for young children in their care. This is a qualitative study consisting of six focus groups conducted in Spanish with a sample of 44 state-licensed Latino FCCH providers in the state of Massachusetts. Translated transcripts were analysed using thematic analyses to identify meaningful patterns. Analyses revealed that Latino FCCH providers have positive beliefs and attitudes about the importance of healthy eating and physical activity for children in their care, but personally struggle with these same behaviours and with maintaining a healthy weight status. The ability of Latino FCCH providers to model healthy eating and physical activity may be limited by their low self-efficacy in their ability to be physically active, eat a healthy diet and maintain a healthy weight. Interventions designed to improve healthy eating and physical activity behaviours of children enrolled in FCCHs should address providers\u2019 own health behaviours as well as their modelling of these health behaviours. Future research can build on the findings of this qualitative study by quantifying Latino FCCH providers\u2019 eating and physical activity behaviours, and determining how these behaviours influence behaviours and health outcomes of children in their care.",

    "abstract": "Increasing the speed of eating or decreasing the amount of chewing of a test meal significantly decreases its satiation, increases concomitant caloric intake, and influences entero-endocrine secretion. Speed of eating is a strong risk factor for obesity and longitudinal studies suggest an etiological relationship. Individuals with obesity have an increase in bite size, less chewing per bite, decreased satiation, and greater food intake. Oral processing in terms of bite size and amount of chewing per gram of food is influenced by food texture and textural complexity. Soft foods increase bite size and decrease chewing per gram of food and meal duration compared to hard foods. An ultra-processed diet can lead to greater weight gain than a non-processed diet and a significant increase in eating rate. Many children with obesity are noted by their parents to have persistent hunger on a questionnaire and this is often extreme. Results of attempts to change eating behavior have been mixed in terms of producing long-term changes in eating behavior and body weight. It is hypothesized that there may be a unidirectional relationship between changes in oral processing, satiation and weight gain. However, the presence of persistent hunger can produce a vicious cycle that may exacerbate obesity and make treatment difficult. The increased energy density of foods as found particularly in ultra-processed foods also influences energy intake and obesity.",

However, limited research has examined how regular consumption of energy drinks is associated with AmED consumption among youth. The purpose of this report is to examine the role of energy drink use on AmED consumption in a Canadian youth population. Using data from the 2015\u20132016 COMPASS survey including 35,300 grade 9 to 12 students, two logistic regression models investigated if the inclusion of energy drink consumption in the past week altered the results of a model examining AmED consumption.

Those who reported drinking energy drinks in the past week were 3.38 times more likely to consume AmED than those who did not drink energy drinks. The inclusion of past week energy drink use decreased the effect size of other associated substance use behaviours. This report demonstrates that past week energy drink use is associated with increased likelihood of AmED consumption and suggests that previous research may have missed this important contributor.

    "abstract": "Urbanization facilitates synanthropic species such as rodents, which benefit the diets of many predators in cities. We investigated how urbanization affects the feeding ecology of dugites Pseudonaja affinis , a common elapid snake in south-west Western Australia. We predicted that urban snakes: 1) more frequently contain prey and eat larger meals, 2) eat proportionally more non-native prey, 3) eat a lower diversity of prey species, and 4) are relatively heavier, than non-urban dugites. We analyzed the diet of 453 specimens obtained from the Western Australian Museum and opportunistic road-kill collections. Correcting for size, sex, season, and temporal biases, we tested whether location influenced diet for our 4 predictions. Body size was a strong predictor of diet (larger snakes had larger prey present, a greater number of prey items, and a greater diversity of prey). We identified potential collection biases: urban dugites were relatively smaller (snout-vent length) than non-urban specimens, and females were relatively lighter than males. Accounting for these effects, urban snakes were less likely to have prey present in their stomachs and were relatively lighter than non-urban snakes. Other urban-adapted carnivores appear to benefit from urbanization through increased food supplementation, but we found the opposite of this: urban dugites were less likely to contain a meal, and their meals were smaller, indicating they did not make greater use of synanthropic species than was evident for non-urban snakes. In contrast to other carnivores, snakes do not appear to fit a consistent directional pattern for size differences between urban and non-urban populations.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 New Mum Study is recording maternal experiences and infant feeding during the UK lockdown. This report from week 1 of the survey describes and compares the delivery and post-natal experiences of women who delivered before (BL) versus during (DL) the lockdown. Women living in the UK aged \u226518 years with an infant \u226412 months of age completed an anonymous online survey ( https://is.gd/covid19newmumstudy ). Information/links are shared via websites, social media and existing contacts. From 27.5.20\u20133.6.20, 1365 women provided data (94% white, 95% married/with partner, 66% degree/higher qualification, 86% living in house; 1049 (77%) delivered BL and 316 (23%) DL. Delivery mode, skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding initiation did not differ between groups. DL women had shorter hospital stays (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). 39% reported changes to their birth plan. Reflecting younger infant age, 59% of DL infants were exclusively breast-fed/mixed fed versus 39% of BL (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). 13% reported a change in feeding; often related to lack of breastfeeding support, especially with practical problems. Important sources of feeding support were the partner (60%), health professional (50%) and online groups (47%). 45% of DL women reported insufficient feeding support. Among BL women, 57% and 69% reported decreased feeding support and childcare, respectively. 40% BL/45% DL women reported insufficient support with their own health, 8%/9% contacted a mental health professional; 11% reported their mental health was affected. 9% highlighted lack of contact/support from family and distress that they had missed seeing the baby. Lockdown has impacted maternal experiences, resulting in distress for many women. Our findings suggest the need for better infant feeding support, especially \u2018face-to-face\u2019 support for practical issues; and recognising and supporting mothers who are struggling with mental health challenges or other aspects of their health. The effectiveness of online versus face-to-face contact is currently uncertain, and requires further evaluation.",

    "abstract": "Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) has many benefits to the child from mental to physical growth and development; however, methods of measuring EBF have raised a number of policy and programmatic questions. This study assesses EBF rates and factors associated with EBF practices in Northern Tanzania using two different methodologies, namely, the 24-hours recall and recall-since-birth. A cohort study was conducted from October 2013 to December 2015 among mother-infants\u2019 pairs. Mothers with child delivery information (N=430) were followed and included in the analyses. We enrolled pregnant women who were in their third trimesters and interviewed them with the help of questionnaires at enrollment, delivery, 7 days and thereafter monthly up to nine months after delivery. At each visit after delivery, information on breastfeeding using the two methods (24 hours recall and recall-since-birth) was collected. The prevalence of EBF dropped from one month to six months when using both the 24 hours recall and the recall since birth methods, but at different rates. At six months, 24.2% of the mothers practiced EBF when measured with the recall since birth method, compared to 38.8% when measured with the 24 hour recall. Predictors of EBF were also different. When using the recall since birth method, women who had received counseling on infant feeding had increased odds of practicing EBF compared to those who did not receive counseling, [AOR=2.3; 95% CI (1.2, 3.7)]. When using 24 hours recall, women who were unemployed had increased odds of practicing EBF compared to those who were employed [AOR=1.5;95% CI(1.1,2.5)], and women aged 35 - 49 years had decreased odds of practicing EBF compared to younger women[AOR=0.28; 95 % CI(0.1,0.7)]. The two methods for EBF give substantially different results, both in the prevalence of EBF and factors associated with EBF. The higher EBF obtained with 24 hours recall represents an overestimation and thereby an overly positive picture of the situation.",

The main objective of this study was to evaluate the breastfeeding status based on parents\u2019 educational level with comparison between Turkman and non-Turkman ethnic groups in the North of Iran in 2010. This is a descriptive, cross-sectional study, which was carried out on 6519 subjects (3897 = non-Turkman and 2622 = Turkman) in urban and rural areas. Data have been collected through interviewing with primary school children's mothers. The schools and students were selected using multi-cluster random sampling methods. Breastfeeding was defined based on WHO predominant definition. Of all mothers, 5.8% (377/6519) breastfed for 6 months, 34.8% (2265/6519) for 7-18 months, 57.4% (3745/6519) for 18-24 months and 2% (132/6519) didn\u2019t breastfeed their infants. Breastfeeding prevalence at 19-24 months in Turkman ethnic group (64.7%; 1696/2622) was significantly more than in non-Turkman ethnic group (52.6%; 2049/3897) ( P < 0.01) besides early weaning prevalence (at 6 months) in Turkman group was significantly less than in non-Turkman group (4.7%; 123/2622 vs. 6.5%; 254/3897) ( P < 0.01). Odds ratio for weaning before 6 months in non-Turkman mothers were 0.563 (0.365-0.786, confidence interval [CI] 95%) in 1-12 years schooling and 0.665 (0.486-0.910, CI: 95%) in uneducated groups compared to college educated. This ratio in Turkman fathers was 3.413 (1.726-6.746, CI: 95%) in 1-12 years schooling compared with college educated. The duration of breastfeeding was longer among Turkman compared with non-Turkman mothers, and longer duration of breastfeeding was associated with higher educational level in the Turkman but not in the non-Turkman mothers.",

To delineate the clinical presentation of melioidosis in the spine and to create awareness among healthcare professionals, particularly spine surgeons, regarding the diagnosis and treatment of melioidotic spondylitis. Melioidosis is an emerging disease, particularly in developing countries, associated with a high mortality rate. Its causative pathogen, Burkholderia pseudomallei , has been labeled as a bio-terrorism agent. We performed a retrospective analysis of patients who were culture positive for B. pseudomallei . Assessment of patients was performed using clinical, radiological, and blood parameters. Clinical measures included pain, neurological deficit, and return to work. Radiological measures included plain radiography of the spine and magnetic resonance imaging. Blood tests included erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels. Four patients having melioidosis with spondylitis were evaluated. All of them had diabetes mellitus; three had multiple abscesses which required incision and drainage. Their clinical spectrum was similar to that of tuberculous spondylitis; all had back pain and radiology revealed infective spondylodiscitis with prevertebral and paravertebral collections with psoas abscess. Three patients underwent ultrasound-guided drainage of the psoas abscess and one had aspiration of the subcutaneous abscess. Bacteriological cultures showed presence of B. pseudomallei , and histopathology showed non-caseating granulomatous inflammation. All patients were treated with intravenous Ceftazidime for 2 weeks, followed by oral bactrim double strength and Doxycycline for 20 weeks. All patients improved with treatment and were healed at follow up. Melioidosis presents with a clinical spectrum similar to that of tuberculosis. A diagnosis of melioidotic spondylitis should be considered, particularly in patients with diabetes with neutrophilic leukocytosis and clinical-radiological features suggestive of infective spondylodiscitis. Bacteriological culture and histopathology helps in differentiating the two conditions. Health education for healthcare professionals is important for correctly diagnosing this disease.",

    "abstract": "Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a disease affecting predominantly premature infants, is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in neonatal intensive care units. Although several predisposing factors have been identified, such as prematurity, enteral feeding, and infection, its pathogenesis remains elusive. In the past 20 years, we have established several animal models of NEC in rats and found several endogenous mediators, especially platelet-activating factor (PAF), which may play a pivotal role in NEC. Injection of PAF induces intestinal necrosis, and PAF antagonists prevent the bowel injury induced by bacterial endotoxin, hypoxia, or challenge with tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF) plus endotoxin in adult rats. The same is true for lesions induced by hypoxia and enteral feeding in neonatal animals. Human patients with NEC show high levels of PAF and decreased plasma PAF-acetylhydrolase, the enzyme degrading PAF. The initial event in our experimental models of NEC is probably polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) activation and adhesion to venules in the intestine, which initiates a local inflammatory reaction involving proinflammatory mediators including TNF, complement, prostaglandins, and leukotriene C4. Subsequent norepinephrine release and mesenteric vasoconstriction result in splanchnic ischemia and reperfusion. Bacterial products (e.g., endotoxin) enter the intestinal tissue during local mucosal barrier breakdown, and endotoxin synergizes with PAF to amplify the inflammation. Reactive oxygen species produced by the activated leukocytes and by intestinal epithelial xanthine oxidase may be the final pathway for tissue injury. Protective mechanisms include nitric oxide produced by the constitutive (mainly neuronal) nitric oxide synthase, and indigenous probiotics such as Bifidobacteria infantis. The former maintains intestinal perfusion and the integrity of the mucosal barrier, and the latter keep virulent bacteria in check. The development of tissue injury depends on the balance between injurious and protective mechanisms.",

However, few studies have investigated the urban-rural differences in social and behavioral factors influencing CRC screening. The objective of the study was to investigate the potential factors across urban-rural groups on the usage of CRC screening. A total of 38,505 adults (aged \u226540 years) were selected from the 2009 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS) data - the latest CHIS data on CRC screening. The weighted generalized linear mixed-model (WGLIMM) was used to deal with this hierarchical structure data. Weighted simple and multiple mixed logistic regression analyses in SAS ver. 9.4 were used to obtain the odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The overall prevalence of CRC screening was 48.1% while the prevalence in four residence groups - urban, second city, suburban, and town/rural, were 45.8%, 46.9%, 53.7% and 50.1%, respectively. The results of WGLIMM analysis showed that there was residence effect (p<0.0001) and residence groups had significant interactions with gender, age group, education level, and employment status (p<0.05). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that age, race, marital status, education level, employment stats, binge drinking, and smoking status were associated with CRC screening (p<0.05). Stratified by residence regions, age and poverty level showed associations with CRC screening in all four residence groups. Education level was positively associated with CRC screening in second city and suburban. Infrequent binge drinking was associated with CRC screening in urban and suburban; while current smoking was a protective factor in urban and town/rural groups. Mixed models are useful to deal with the clustered survey data. Social factors and behavioral factors (binge drinking and smoking) were associated with CRC screening and the associations were affected by living areas such as urban and rural regions.",

In the blood circulation index, heart rate (HR), estimated cardiac output (ECO), and estimated cardiac output index (ECI) increased significantly right after eating compared to before eating. By contrast, estimated circulation resistance (ECR) and estimated circulation resistance index (ECRI) decreased significantly right after eating compared to before eating. E had a tendency to increase right after eating compared to before eating and decrease gradually at every experimental point (left and right Chon, Kwan, and Cheok). RAI had a tendency to decrease right after eating compared to before eating and increase gradually at every experimental point. Different eating times can bring about changes on blood circulation index, E, and RAI. These changes show a certain tendency and coincide with the physiological factors that eating causes a rise of HR, an increase of systolic cardiac pump performance, and a reduction of peripheral vascular resistance.",

Here, we examined the baseline range of breastmilk leukocytes and immunomodulatory biomolecules in healthy mother/infant dyads and how they are influenced by infections of the dyad. Consistent with a greater immunological need in the early postpartum period, colostrum contained considerable numbers of leukocytes (13\u201370% out of total cells) and high levels of immunoglobulins and lactoferrin. Within the first 1\u20132 weeks postpartum, leukocyte numbers decreased significantly to a low baseline level in mature breastmilk (0\u20132%) ( P <0.001). This baseline level was maintained throughout lactation unless the mother and/or her infant became infected, when leukocyte numbers significantly increased up to 94% leukocytes out of total cells ( P <0.001). Upon recovery from the infection, baseline values were restored. The strong leukocyte response to infection was accompanied by a more variable humoral immune response. Exclusive breastfeeding was associated with a greater baseline level of leukocytes in mature breastmilk. Collectively, our results suggest a strong association between the health status of the mother/infant dyad and breastmilk leukocyte levels. This could be used as a diagnostic tool for assessment of the health status of the lactating breast as well as the breastfeeding mother and infant.",

    "abstract": "Little is known about innate immunity to bacteria after birth in the hitherto sterile fetal intestine. Breast-feeding has long been associated with a lower incidence of gastrointestinal infections and inflammatory and allergic diseases. We found in human breast milk a 48-kD polypeptide, which we confirmed by mass spectrometry and sequencing to be a soluble form of the bacterial pattern recognition receptor CD14 (sCD14). Milk sCD14 (m-sCD14) concentrations were up to 20-fold higher than serum sCD14 from nonpregnant, pregnant, or lactating women. In contrast, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein was at very low levels. Mammary epithelial cells produced 48-kD sCD14. m-sCD14 mediated activation by LPS and whole bacteria of CD14 negative cells, including intestinal epithelial cells, resulting in release of innate immune response molecules. m-sCD14 was undetectable in the infant formulas and commercial (cows') milk tested, although it was present in bovine colostrum. These findings indicate a sentinel role for sCD14 in human milk during bacterial colonization of the gut, and suggest that m-sCD14 may be involved in modulating local innate and adaptive immune responses, thus controlling homeostasis in the neonatal intestine.",

We investigated their salt-eating habits by questionnaire and salt taste threshold through a rating scale that used serial dilution of a sodium chloride solution. Predicted 24-hr urinary salt excretions using Kawasaki's and Tanaka's equations estimated dietary salt intake. Participants' mean age was 35 yr, and 59.5% were male.

The aim of this study was to evaluate adequacy and trends in energy and nutrient intakes of US infants and children aged 0\u201347.9 mo through use of Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study (FITS) data from 2002, 2008, and 2016. FITS are cross-sectional surveys of parents/caregivers of infants and young children (FITS 2002, n =\u00a02962; FITS 2008, n =\u00a03276; FITS 2016, n =\u00a03235). Dietary intakes were assessed by telephone with trained interviewers using the Nutrition Data System for Research. Mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SE nutrient intakes were calculated. Diet adequacy was assessed with the nutrient adequacy ratio (NAR) for 17 nutrients and the corresponding mean adequacy ratio. Energy and macronutrient intakes were generally stable across surveys, but significant decreases for saturated fat and total sugars and an increase in fiber were observed among 6\u201311.9-mo-olds and 12\u201323.9-mo-olds ( P -trend < 0.0001). Mean sodium intakes exceeded Adequate Intakes (AI) for all ages, whereas fiber intakes were universally below the AI. Nutrients with the lowest NAR values were vitamin D (range 0.41\u20130.67/1.00) and vitamin E (range 0.60\u20130.79/1.00 for 2008 and 2016). For iron, infants aged 6\u201311.9 mo had the lowest NAR values at 0.77\u20130.88/1.00, compared to 0.85\u20130.89/1.00 for 12\u201347.9-mo-olds. Potassium was low from 12 to 47.9 mo (NAR range 0.55\u20130.63/1.00 across survey years). The nutrients with the greatest decline in mean intakes were iron and vitamins D and E among 6\u201311.9-mo-olds, and vitamin D and potassium among 12\u201323.9-mo-olds in 2016 compared to 2002. The diets of US infants and young children were generally adequate for most micronutrients and stable over time, but sodium intakes were too high, and nutrient gaps still existed, especially for vitamins D, E, and fiber across ages and for iron among infants.",

Minimal acceptable diet was received by 58% of children. Breastfeeding was continued in 86% children at 1 year of age and 41% children at 2 years of age. Bottle feeding was present in 26% of children. Multivariate regression analysis was done to correlate minimum acceptable diet and various variables affecting the feeding habits.

    "abstract": "Recent genome-wide association studies have identified a strong association between obesity and common variants in the fat mass and obesity associated ( FTO ) gene. FTO has been detected in the hypothalamus, but little is known about its regulation in that particular brain structure. The present study addressed the hypothesis that hypothalamic FTO expression is regulated by nutrients, specifically by glucose, and that its regulation by nutrients is impaired in obesity. The effect of intraperitoneal (i.p.) or intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of glucose on hypothalamic Fto mRNA levels was examined in fasted mice. Additionally, the effect of glucose on Fto mRNA levels was also investigated ex vivo using mouse hypothalamic explants. Lastly, the effect of i.p. glucose injection on hypothalamic Fto immunoreactivity and food intake was compared between lean wild-type and obese ob/ob mice. In wild-type mice, fasting reduced both Fto mRNA levels and the number of Fto-immunoreactive cells in the hypothalamus, whereas i.p. glucose treatment reversed this effect of fasting. Furthermore, i.c.v. glucose treatment also increased hypothalamic Fto mRNA levels in fasted mice. Incubation of hypothalamic explants at high glucose concentration increased Fto mRNA levels. In ob/ob mice, both fasting and i.p. glucose treatment failed to alter the number of Fto-immunoreactive cells in the hypothalamus. Glucose-induced feeding suppression was abolished in ob/ob mice. Reduction in hypothalamic Fto expression after fasting likely arises at least partly from reduced circulating glucose levels and/or reduced central action of glucose. Obesity is associated with impairments in glucose-mediated regulation of hypothalamic Fto expression and anorexia. Hypothalamic Fto-expressing neurons may have a role in the regulation of metabolism by monitoring metabolic states of the body.",

    "abstract": "The eating quality of cooked rice is important and determines its market price and consumer acceptance. To comprehensively describe the variation of eating quality in 183 rice germplasm accessions, we evaluated 33 eating-quality traits including amylose and protein contents, pasting properties of rice flour, and texture of cooked rice grains. All eating-quality traits varied widely in the germplasm accessions. Principal-components analysis (PCA) revealed that allelic differences in the Wx gene explained the largest proportion of phenotypic variation of the eating-quality traits. In 146 accessions of non-glutinous temperate japonica rice, PCA revealed that protein content and surface texture of the cooked rice grains significantly explained phenotypic variations of the eating-quality traits. An allelic difference based on simple sequence repeats, which was located near a quantitative trait locus (QTL) on the short arm of chromosome 3, was associated with differences in the eating quality of non-glutinous temperate japonica rice. These results suggest that eating quality is controlled by genetic factors, including the Wx gene and the QTL on chromosome 3, in Japanese rice accessions. These genetic factors have been consciously selected for eating quality during rice breeding programs in Japan.",

    "abstract": "There have been conflicting reports concerning the relationship between breast-feeding and the development of atopic dermatitis (AD) in early childhood. The objective of this study was to investigate the associations between breast-feeding and the risk of AD in early childhood in Korea. We combined the fourth and fifth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data collected from 2007 to 2012 and analyzed 2,015 children at 1 to 3 years old. Regression analysis was used to determine the association of the following variables: AD, feeding types, duration of breast-feeding, and others. The annual prevalence of exclusive breast-feeding and AD decreased. Parents with allergic diseases preferred breast-feeding and extended duration of feeding compared with those without. In multiple logistic regression analyses, exclusive breast-feeding in feeding type I ( P =0.070; adjusted odds ratio [OR]=1.990), exclusive breast-feeding in feeding type II ( P =0.095; adjusted OR=1.495) and breast-feeding duration ( P =0.430; adjusted OR=1.013) were not significantly related to AD. Breast-feeding was not found to be associated with an occurrence of AD in young children. Rather, parents with histories of allergic diseases tended to prefer breast-feeding and extend its duration. To clarify the role of breast-feeding in the development of AD, a nation-wide prospective study is needed.",

A similar double involvement is also found in disorders of the brain-gut interaction (DGBI) and symptoms are sometimes similar. To find out where there is an association and a cause-effect relationship, we looked for the comorbidity of DGBI and ED. A systematic review was undertaken. A literature search was performed. Inclusion criteria for the articles retained for analysis were: Observational cohort population-based or hospital-based and case-control studies, examining the relationship between DGBI and ED. Exclusion criteria were: Studies written in other languages than English, abstracts, conference presentations, letters to the Editor and editorials. Selected papers by two independent investigators were critically evaluated and included in this review. We found 29 articles analyzing the relation between DGBI and ED comprising 13 articles on gastroparesis, 5 articles on functional dyspepsia, 7 articles about functional constipation and 4 articles on irritable bowel syndrome. There is no evidence for a cause-effect relationship between DGBI and ED. Their common symptomatology requires correct identification and a tailored therapy of each disorder.",

However, negative effects of this cultivar on the honey bee Apis mellifera L., the most important pollinator for cultivated ecosystem, remained poorly investigated. The objective of our study was to evaluate the potential side effects of transgenic Cry1Ac\u00a0+\u00a0CpTI pollen from cotton on young adult honey bees A. mellifera L. Two points emphasized the significance of our study: (1) A higher expression level of insecticidal protein Cry1Ac in pollen tissues was detected (when compared with previous reports). In particular, Cry1Ac protein was detected at 300\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.52\u00a0ng\u00a0g \u22121 [part per billion (ppb)] in pollen collected in July, (2) Effects on chronic mortality and feeding behaviour in honey bees were evaluated using a no-choice dietary feeding protocol with treated pollen, which guarantee the highest exposure level to bees potentially occurring in natural conditions (worst case scenario). Tests were also conducted using imidacloprid-treated pollen at a concentration of 48\u00a0ppb as positive control for sublethal effect on feeding behaviour. Our results suggested that Cry1Ac\u00a0+\u00a0CpTI pollen carried no lethal risk for honey bees. However, during a 7-day oral exposure to the various treatments (transgenic, imidacloprid-treated and control), honey bee feeding behaviour was disturbed and bees consumed significantly less CCRI41 cotton pollen than in the control group in which bees were exposed to conventional cotton pollen. It may indicate an antifeedant effect of CCRI41 pollen on honey bees and thus bees may be at risk because of large areas are planted with transgenic Bt cotton in China. This is the first report suggesting a potential sublethal effect of CCRI41 cotton pollen on honey bees. The implications of the results are discussed in terms of risk assessment for bees as well as for directions of future work involving risk assessment of CCRI41 cotton.",

These have been shown to include anti-cancer, anti-angiogenic, and anti-metastatic effects, as well as being able to provide hepatic and neuroprotective effects, immunomodulation, vasodilation, promotion of insulin secretion, and antioxidant activity. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to examine how quickly the ginsenosides decompose and what kinds of degradation products are created under physicochemical processing conditions that don\u2019t involve toxic chemicals or other treatments that may be harmful. The formation of ginsenoside-Rg2 and ginsenoside-Rg3 was examined. These demonstrated diverse pharmacological effects. We also investigated physicochemical factors affecting their conversion. The heating temperatures and times yielding the highest concentration of ginsenosides (-Rb1, -Rb2, -Rc, -Rd, -Rf, -Rg1, and \u2013Re) were examined. Additionally, the heating temperatures and rates of conversion of these ginsenosides into new \u2018ginseng saponins\u2019, were examined. In conclusion, obtained provide us with effective technology to control the concentration of both ginsenosides and the downstream converted saponins (ginsenoside-Rg2, Rg3, Rg5, and Rk1 etc.), as well as identifying the processing conditions which enable an enrichment in concentration of these compounds.",

The study was aimed to survey prevalent enteral nutrition practices in the trauma intensive care unit, nurses\u2019 perception, and their knowledge of enteral feeding. The study was conducted in the ICU of a level 1 trauma center, Jai Prakash Narayan Apex Trauma Centre, AIIMS, New Delhi, India. The study design used an audit. Sixty questionnaires were distributed and the results analyzed. A database was prepared and the audit was done. Forty-two (70%) questionnaires were filled and returned. A majority (38) of staff nurses expressed awareness of nutrition guidelines. A large number (32) of staff nurses knew about nutrition protocols of the ICU. Almost all (40) opined enteral nutrition to be the preferred route of nutrition unless contraindicated. All staff nurses were of opinion that enteral nutrition is to be started at the earliest (within 24\u201348 h of the ICU stay). Everyone opined that the absence of bowel sounds is an absolute contraindication to initiate enteral feeding. Passage of flatus was considered mandatory before starting enteral nutrition by 86% of the respondents. Everyone knew that the method of Ryle's tube feeding in their ICU is intermittent boluses. Only 4 staff nurses were unaware of any method to confirm Ryle's tube position. The backrest elevation rate was 100%. Gastric residual volumes were always checked, but the amount of the gastric residual volume for the next feed to be withheld varied. The majority said that the unused Ryle's tube feed is to be discarded after 6 h. The most preferred (48%) method to upgrade their knowledge of enteral nutrition was from the ICU protocol manual. Information generated from this study can be helpful in identifying nutrition practices that are lacking and may be used to review and revise enteral feeding practices where necessary.",

    "abstract": "Fear of post-cessation weight gain may be a barrier to cessation therapy or may lead to smoking relapse. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between the change in eating behavior and post-cessation weight gain. A prospective study that included 103 cigarette smokers, who visited the family medicine clinics of a training and research hospital for smoking cessation treatment between June 2018 and December 2018, was planned. A face to face survey (including Turkish version of Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire-DEBQ and weight measures) was applied to all individuals at first and the final visits for the assessment of restrained, emotional, and external eating behaviors. Statistical analyses were completed using the IBM SPSS Statistics 22 program. Of 103 patients screened (M age=38.3 years SD=9.28), 58.3% were male, and 40.8% were in heavy nicotine dependence level (NDL) group. The mean weight increased by 4.74\u00b12.63 kg in three months of smoking cessation. In the high NDL group, three subscales score (restrained p<0.001, emotional p=0.007, external p=0.005) of the DEBQ increased. Weight gain was significative associated with NDL (p=0.01). There was a positive correlation between Fagerstrom score and weight (kg) gain (r: 0.34; p=0.001). Weight change according to the emotional eating behavior was significantly different by gender (female p=0.005; male p=0.04). Women had a higher difference in emotional eating behavior score than men. Obese smokers had a higher initial restrained eating score than non-obese smokers (p=0.009). Weight gain of nicotine replacement therapy group had a similar result in the pharmacotherapy (varenicline) group (p=0.26). Both of treatment types concluded with a significant weight change (p=0.001). This study obtained that post-cessation weight gain is related to high nicotine dependence, and quit smoking causes increased scores of emotional, restrained, external eating behavior subscales. Post-cessation eating behavior is negatively affected by quit smoking.",

Women in the early feeding group had sips of oral fluid 6 h postoperatively while those in the delayed feeding group were on nil per oral for the first 24 h after surgery before commencement on liquid diet. Primary outcome measure was development of symptoms of paralytic ileus while secondary outcome measures included time interval to return of bowel sound, duration of hospital stay, and patients satisfaction which was determined using a visual analog score. The incidence of mild ileus symptoms was similar in both groups. Early-fed group had significantly shorter mean postoperative time intervals to return of bowel sound, (7.3 h vs. 11.5 h [ P = 0.005]), passage of flatus, (30.7 h vs. 37.5 h [ P = 0.009]). Hospital stay was also significantly shorter in the early feeding group, (4.2 days vs. 4.9 days [ P < 0.001]). Early-fed women had higher levels of satisfaction.

To describe the implementation of neurodevelopmental care for newborn preterm infants in neonatal ICUs in France in 2011, analyze changes since 2004, and investigate factors associated with practice. Prospective national cohort study of all births before 32 weeks of gestation. Twenty-five French regions. All neonatal ICUs ( n = 66); neonates surviving at discharge ( n = 3,005). None. Neurodevelopmental care policies and practices were assessed by structured questionnaires. Proportions of neonates initiating kangaroo care during the first week of life and those whose mothers expressed breast milk were measured as neurodevelopmental care practices. Multilevel logistic regression analyses were used to investigate relationships between kangaroo care or breast-feeding practices and unit policies, taking into account potential confounders. Free visiting policies, bed availability for parents, and kangaroo care encouragement significantly improved between 2004 and 2011 but with large variabilities between units. Kangaroo care initiation varied from 39% for neonates in the most restrictive units to 68% in less restrictive ones ( p < 0.001). Individual factors associated with kangaroo care initiation were gestational age (odds ratio, 5.79; 95% CI, 4.49\u20137.48 for babies born at 27\u201331\u2009wk compared with babies born at 23\u201326\u2009wk) and, to a lesser extent, single pregnancy, birthweight above the 10th centile, and mother\u2019s employment before pregnancy. At unit level, policies and training in neurodevelopmental care significantly influenced kangaroo care initiation (odds ratio, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.8\u20137.0 for Newborn Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program implementation compared with no training). Breast milk expression by mothers was greater in units with full-time availability professionals trained for breast-feeding support (60% vs 73%; p < 0.0001).

    "abstract": "The consumption of drugs during young adulthood may be particularly detrimental given important neurodevelopmental changes occurring during this period. As impulsivity may lead to substance use and substance use to the commission of seemingly impulsive acts, an improved understanding of the relationship between alcohol use, other substance use and impulsivity in young adults is important. We gathered information on self-reported impulsivity, recreational drug use, and drinking habits of 205 (105 female) undergraduate students. Results showed that 64% of the students reported using marijuana at least once and these individuals were more likely to report binge drinking. Polysubstance use, defined as using marijuana and at least one other illicit substance, was reported by 20% of students. These individuals reported more drinking occasions per month and had higher levels of trait impulsivity. Rates of recreational drug use were similar to those reported in recent national surveys, suggesting an increase in experimentation with specific illicit drugs. Given that a majority of undergraduate drinkers reported marijuana use and its association with binge drinking, future research should clarify the relationship between marijuana use and binge consumption of alcohol and prevention efforts should consider the conjoint targeting of marijuana and binge drinking. The associations between polysubstance use, binge-level alcohol consumption and elevated self-reported impulsivity suggests that perceived trait impulsivity across multiple domains may predispose to excessive use of multiple substances. Longitudinal studies should examine the contribution of impulsivity to the initiation and experimentation with illicit drugs and the influence of specific substances on impulsivity.",

This study sought to estimate the prevalence of psoriasis among adolescents in Kuwait and assess its association with different risk factors, including obesity, sibship size, breastfeeding, and exposure to household secondhand smoke (SHS) and pets. Schoolchildren aged 11\u201314\u00a0years ( n =\u20093864) were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. Lifetime and current (past 12\u00a0months) prevalence of psoriasis were ascertained according to ever having a history of doctor-diagnosis plus current active lesion(s) and/or current use of treatment of psoriasis. Associations were assessed using Poisson regression with robust variance estimation, and adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated. The lifetime and current prevalence of psoriasis were estimated to be 3.6% (136/3806) and 1.1% (42/3806), respectively. Commonly reported anatomical sites affected by psoriasis included scalp (47.6%) and the extensor surface of the knees (50%) and elbows (38.1%). Household SHS exposure was associated with increased lifetime psoriasis (aPR\u2009=\u20091.41, 95% CI 1.07\u20131.98), and showed a trend for association with current psoriasis (1.77, 0.89\u20133.53). Similarly, cat-keeping during infancy was associated with lifetime psoriasis (1.96, 1.14\u20133.37), and demonstrated a trend for association with current psoriasis (1.49, 0.52\u20131.98). In contrast, breastfeeding was associated with a decreased lifetime psoriasis (0.62, 0.44\u20130.89), but was not associated with current psoriasis. Trend analyses showed that the prevalence of lifetime and current psoriasis increased with increasing numbers of total, older, and younger siblings. Psoriasis affects a considerable proportion of schoolchildren in Kuwait. Interestingly, psoriasis prevalence was related to risk factors also found in allergic diseases, such as exposure to SHS, cat-keeping in infancy, breastfeeding, and sibship size, possibly suggesting a role of immune dysregulation.",

    "abstract": "The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in changes to perinatal and neonatal care, concentrating on minimizing risks of transmission to the newborn and health care staff while ensuring medical care is not compromised for both mother and infant. Current recommendations on infant care and feeding when mother has COVID-19 ranges from mother\u2013infant separation and avoidance of human milk feeding, to initiation of early skin-to-skin contact and direct breastfeeding. Health care providers fearing risks of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) maternal\u2013infant transmission may veer toward restricted breastfeeding practices. We reviewed guidelines and published literature and propose three options for infant feeding depending on various scenarios. Option A involves direct breastfeeding with the infant being cared for by the mother or caregiver. In option B, the infant is cared for by another caregiver and receives mother's expressed milk. In the third option, the infant is not breastfed directly and does not receive mother's expressed milk. We recommend joint decision making by parents and the health care team. This decision is also flexible as situation changes. We also provide a framework for counseling mothers on these options using a visual aid and a corresponding structured training program for health care providers. Future research questions are also proposed. We conclude that evidence and knowledge about COVID-19 and breastfeeding are still evolving. Our options can provide a quick and flexible reference guide that can be adapted to local needs.  Key Points  SARS-CoV-2 is unlikely transmitted via human milk. A shared decision making on infant feeding is the preferred approach. Mothers can safely breastfeed with appropriate infection control measures.",

    "abstract": "There is paucity of studies on infant feeding practices from the rural areas of garhwal Himalayas of the state of uttarakhand. The present study was designed to assess the infant feeding practices in Garhwal region. Infant feeding practices have significant implications on a child's health. Early nutritional status especially during the first year of life has been shown to have a significant effect on child health and development. Optimal infant feeding practices are crucial for nutritional status, growth, development, health, and ultimately the survival of infants and young children. The study of infant feeding practices is essential before formulation of any interventional programme. A study was conducted in HNB Base Hospital and Teaching Institute with the aim to assess the infant feeding practices and the prevalence of malnutrition in the study population reporting at the hospital in garhwal region of uttarakhand. This is an observational cross sectional study. 275 infants were included in the study. After taking informed consent, case study forms were filled by interviewing the infants' mothers. Weight, length and head circumference of each infant was also measured. The information thus obtained was compiled, tabulated and analysed statistically. The study findings revealed that 46.4% infants in the age group 0-5 months were breastfed within 1 hour of birth. 52.8% infants aged 0-5 months of were exclusively breastfed. 33.6% infants in age group 0-5 months received prelacteal feeds. 53.12% infants in age group 6-8 months received solid, semi-solid or soft food, in addition to breast milk. 53.33% infants were partially or fully bottle fed. Age appropriate feeding was found in 56% infants. The percentage of wasting, stunting and underweight in 0-5 months was 33.6%,30.4% and 36.8% respectively . The percentage of wasting, stunting and underweight in 6-11 months was 28%, 26.5% and 30.7% respectively. There appeared to be an association between longer duration of exclusive breastfeeding and lower prevalence of stunting and underweight at 6 months of age. This study shows that undesirable infant feeding practices are still prevalent in the community. Lower prevalence of stunting and underweight was observed in infants with longer duration of exclusive breastfeeding. A comprehensive plan to address the problems in infant feeding should be formulated. Antenatal counselling of mothers should be done. Revitalization of the Baby Friendly Hospital Initiative(BHFI) in health facilities is recommended.",

Food insecurity was associated with greater prevalence of bulimic-spectrum eating disorders (prevalence ratio [PR]\u2009=\u20093.81; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.26\u20136.42), mood disorders (PR\u2009=\u20092.53; 95% CI 1.96\u20133.29), and anxiety disorders (PR\u2009=\u20091.69; 95% CI 1.39\u20132.07). Results indicate that food insecurity is associated with a range of internalizing mental disorders, though these findings should be confirmed with contemporary data to reflect DSM-5 diagnostic updates and the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings from this study emphasize the need to expand food insecurity interventions and improve access to mental health services for food-insecure populations.

    "abstract": "Among preterm infants, mother\u2019s own milk feeding reduces neonatal morbidity and decreases the length of hospital stay. However, breastfeeding rates and duration are lower than among term infants. It is reported that peer counselling is effective in increasing breast feeding in term infants in low-income and middle-income countries, but results are mixed in high-income countries. We aim to investigate herein whether peer counselling may be a feasible and effective breastfeeding support among preterm infants in French-speaking high-income countries. Eight European centres will participate in this stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial. We plan to include 2400 hospitalised neonates born before 35 gestational weeks. Each centre will begin with an observational period. Every 3\u2009months, a randomised cluster (centre) will begin the interventional period with peer counsellors until the end of the study. The counsellors will be trained and supervised by the trained nurses. They will have a weekly contact with participating mothers, with a face-to-face meeting at least once every fortnight. During these meetings, peer counsellors will listen to mothers\u2019 concerns, share experiences and help the mother with their own knowledge of breast feeding. The main outcome is breastfeeding rate at 2 months corrected age. Secondary outcomes are breastfeeding rates at hospital discharge and at 6 months, breastfeeding duration and severe neonatal morbidity and mortality. The mental health of the mother, mother\u2013infant bonding and infant behaviour will be assessed using self-report questionnaires. A neurodevelopmental follow-up, a cost-effectiveness analysis and a cost\u2013consequence at 2 years corrected age will be performed among infants in a French subgroup. French, Belgian and Swiss ethics committees gave their agreement. Publications in peer-reviewed journals are planned on breast feeding, mental health and economic outcomes.  NCT03156946 ",

    "abstract": "Background/Objective: Eating disorders (EDs) represent serious yet understudied mental health issues, particularly amongst young adult men attending colleges, who are at the average age of onset. Despite this and recent evidence that in young adult men the core ED symptoms are prevalent and remain relatively stable over the college period, little is known about factors associated with both the onset and maintenance of diagnosable EDs in this population. This work sought to address these research gaps. Method: Logistic regression analyses were conducted using data from an on-going longitudinal study of eating and mental health issues to examine the influence of theoretically relevant factors in predicting the onset and maintenance of men's (DSM-5) EDs at 4-year follow-up ( N =\u00a02,507). Results: Body dissatisfaction, self-objectification, appearance-ideal internalization, dieting, and negative affectivity were all predictors of ED onset and maintenance. Self-objectification was the largest contributor to both ED onset and maintenance. Conclusions: The findings highlight potentially similar psychosocial foci for prevention and treatment efforts. Implications for improving existing preventive and treatment approaches are discussed.",

Many studies have investigated the effects of RAC on growth performance and carcass characteristics; however, there is minimal information about the influence of RAC on feeding behavior. Sixty-nine steers (body weight [BW] = 364 \u00b1 3.9 kg) predominately of Angus and Simmental breeding were subjected to a 126-d ( n = 46) or 154-d ( n = 23) feeding period and randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: supplementation to provide 0 (CON; n = 34) or 267 \u00b1 4.9 mg/d of RAC ( n = 35). Ractopamine was provided as Optaflexx 45 at 0.024% of the diet (dry matter [DM] basis; Elanco Animal Health, Greenfield, IN). Dietary treatments were fed the final 42 d in the feed yard (treatment period). Feeding behavior and growth performance were measured using radio frequency identification tags and the Insentec feeding system. Following the final day of treatment, steers were slaughtered and carcass measurements were recorded. Data were analyzed using MIXED models in SAS. There were no differences in BW, average daily gain (ADG), DM intake (DMI), gain:feed ratio (G:F), or feeding behavior during the pretreatment period ( P > 0.44). Ractopamine supplementation increased G:F during the treatment period ( P = 0.02) and during the total period ( P = 0.03) and tended to increase ADG during the treatment and total period ( P \u2264 0.08). DMI was not affected during the treatment or total period ( P > 0.67). Eating time per visit, per meal, and per day were decreased ( P < 0.02) in steers supplemented with RAC during the treatment period. DMI per minute was increased ( P = 0.02) in steers supplemented with RAC. Hot carcass weight, dressing percentage, and 12th rib fat were not influenced by RAC supplementation. Ractopamine supplementation decreased marbling ( P = 0.008) and kidney, pelvic, and heart percentage ( P = 0.04) and increased longissimus muscle area ( P = 0.01). These data demonstrate that RAC supplementation for 42 d improves feed efficiency, increases the rate of DMI without altering DMI, and increases muscling in finishing cattle.",

In Malawi, where BFHI was introduced in 1993 but later languished due to losses in funding, the Maternal and Child Survival Program supported the Malawi Ministry of Health (MOH) in the revitalization and scale\u2010up of BFHI in 54 health facilities across all 28 districts of the country. This paper describes the revitalization and scale\u2010up process within the context of an integrated health project; successes, challenges, and lessons learned with BFHI implementation; and the future of BFHI in Malawi. More than 80,000 mothers received counselling on exclusive breastfeeding following childbirth prior to discharge from the health facility. Early initiation of breastfeeding was tracked quarterly from baseline through endline via routine MOH health facility data. Increases in early initiation of breastfeeding were seen in two of the three regions of Malawi: by 2% in the Central region and 6% in the Southern region. Greater integration of BFHI into Malawi's health system is recommended, including improved preservice and in\u2010service trainings for health providers to include expanded BFHI content, increased country financial investments in BFHI, and integration of BFHI into national clinical guidelines, protocols, and nutrition and health policies.",

    "abstract": "Fractioning and/or preheating treatment on the rheological properties of myofibrillar protein (MP) gels induced by microbial transglutaminase (MTG) has been reported that they may improve the functional properties. However, the optimum condition was varied depending on the experimental factors. This study was to evaluate the effect of red bean protein isolate (RBPI) on the rheological properties of MP gels mediated by MTG as affected by modifications (fractioning: 7S-globulin of RBPI and/or preheat treatment (pre-heating; 95\u2103/30 min): pre-heating RBPI or pre-heating/7S-globulin). Cooking yields (CY, %) of MP gels was increased with RBPI ( p <0.05), while 7S-globulin decreased the effect of RBPI ( p <0.05); however, preheating treatments did not affect the CY ( p >0.05). Gel strength of MP was decreased when RBPI or 7S-globulin added, while preheat treatments compensated for the negative effects of those in MP. This effect was entirely reversed by MTG treatment. Although the major band of RBPI disappeared, the preheated 7S globulin band was remained. In scanning electron microscopic (SEM) technique, the appearance of more cross-linked structures were observed when RBPI was prepared with preheating at 95\u2103 to improve the protein-protein interaction during gel setting of MP mixtures. Thus, the effects of RBPI and 7S-globulin as a substrate, and water and meat binder for MTG-mediated MP gels were confirmed to improve the rheological properties. However, preheat treatment of RBPI should be optimized.",

    "abstract": "Adolescents with type 1 diabetes are at a higher risk of developing psychiatric disorders, particularly eating disorders, compared with their healthy peers. In turn, this increases the risk for sub-optimal glycaemic control and life-threatening diabetes-related complications. Despite these increased risks, standard diabetes care does not routinely provide psychological support to help prevent or reduce mental health risks. There is an urgent need to develop \u2018clinically usable\u2019 psychosocial interventions that are acceptable to patients and can be realistically integrated into clinical care. This study aims to examine the feasibility and acceptability of a brief self-compassion intervention for adolescents with type 1 diabetes and disordered eating behaviour. This feasibility study will examine the effectiveness of a brief self-compassion intervention, compared with a waitlist control group. Participants aged 12\u201316 years will be recruited from three diabetes outpatient clinics in Auckland, New Zealand. The brief self-compassion intervention is adapted from the standardised \u2018Making Friends with Yourself\u2019 intervention and will be delivered in a group format over two sessions. Apart from examining feasibility and acceptability through the flow of participants through the study and qualitative questions, we will assess changes to disordered eating behaviour (primary outcome), self-care behaviours, diabetes-related distress, self-compassion, stress and glycaemic control (secondary outcomes). Such data will be used to calculate the required sample size for a fully powered randomised controlled trial. This trial has received ethics approval from the Health and Disability Ethics Committee (research project number A+8467). Study results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals and conferences. ANZCTR (12619000541101).",

Well baby clinics in 14 randomly selected primary healthcare centres covering all geographical areas on the national level. Three hundred and six (163 male and 143 female) infants of all nationalities were enrolled. Mothers were asked to complete a predesigned interview questionnaire and infants were blood tested for anaemia, ID and IDA. Cut-off point used to diagnose anaemia was haemoglobin <11.1\u2009g/dL, and to diagnose ID, serum ferritin <6\u2009ug/L with normal C reactive protein. Prevalence of anaemia was 23.5%, ID was 9.2% and IDA was 7.8%. ID was more prevalent among non-Qatari infants compared with Qatari (10.9% vs1.7%, p = 0.029), more prevalent among infants born to housewives and to families of low income (p\u22640.05). With regard to feeding practice, ID was higher in infants who continued breastfeeding until the age of 1\u2009year and among those who never took infant formula milk (p\u22640.05). Mothers who received infant feeding counselling had less ID occurrence among their infants compared with their counterparts who did not receive such counselling (4.2%vs13.4%, p=0.005). Although ID and IDA among infants in Qatar are less prevalent compared with many developing countries, still further efforts are needed for improvement towards more developed countries. Efforts should be contextualised and should target the key epidemiological features with special emphasis on infant feeding and infant feeding counselling to mothers.",

We recorded the data using teledentistry software for the medical file and an intraoral camera for the clinical videos. Remote diagnosis was performed using the Basic Erosive Wear Examination index. In addition, the participants completed a questionnaire to assess their risk factors for dental pathologies. We found dental erosion in 92% of the patients, and 50% had at least one tooth with BEWE 2 or 3 type erosion. Despite the fact that there can be wide variety within a group of individuals with similar risk factors, dental telemedicine could promote awareness within this at-risk population, as well as provide personalised prevention advice to each patient.

Clinical researchers from the European Childhood Obesity Group (ECOG) adopted an evidence-based approach to examine the literature concerning the assessment of eating behaviour in children who are obese. Studies published in English were filtered out of the medical and psychological literature from 1960 to the present, and the resulting bibliography was searched for relevant articles. Key themes from the current evidence were compiled and classified according to the underpinning psychological models. Based on the current evidence and the authors' combined clinical experience, a three-staged approach to assessment was agreed by consensus. Valid and reliable tools for assessing and monitoring each of the three identified models (Dietary Restraint Theory, Emotional Eating and the Diathesis-Stress Model) are suggested for use in clinical practice, and the ECOG three-staged approach to assessing eating behaviours in the absence of hunger is described. This paper presents practical guidance on how to assess eating behaviour in the absence of hunger in children who are clinically obese and suggests a focus for future research.",

Newborn care practices play a key role in preventing these deaths. The aim of this study was to examine the association between delivery location and early newborn care in Nigeria. Data from the 2013 Nigeria Demographic and Health Survey were analyzed. The main exposure variable was delivery location (home, public hospital, public health center/clinic and private hospital/clinic). The outcomes were early initiation of breastfeeding, breastfeeding support, and cord examination. We used multivariate logistic regression to estimate the odds of newborn care. We observed that the prevalence of all three outcome indicators was low. After adjusting for confounders, birth in public health facilities, compared to home birth, was associated with early initiation of breastfeeding (public hospitals: OR 1.62, 95% CI: 1.29-2.03; public health centers/clinics OR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.02-1.61). Breastfeeding support and cord examination were each associated with birth in public hospitals only compared to home birth (OR 1.41, 95% CI: 1.09-1.81 and OR 1.41, 95% CI: 1.11-1.79, respectively). Early newborn care in Nigeria was suboptimal and the quality of this care varied across delivery locations and birth attendants. Public hospitals had the most favorable newborn care outcomes. Policies and programs to enhance the quality of facility-based early newborn care and promote community-based newborn care could improve neonatal outcomes and reduce overall child mortality in resource-challenged settings.",

Students reported their school physical activity participation (none, intramurals only, varsity only, both) and past 30-day substance use (binge drinking, cannabis use, cigarette use, e-cigarette use). Hierarchical logistic regression models predicted the odds of substance use, by sex. 55% of students did not participate in any school sports and 32% reported substance use. Intramurals were negatively associated with cannabis use and cigarette use among all students and e-cigarette use among females. Varsity sports were associated with lower odds of cigarette use among all students and cannabis use among males. In contrast, participating in varsity sports was associated with increased odds of binge drinking and e-cigarette use among all students. Participating in both intramurals and varsity sports was associated with increased odds of binge drinking and e-cigarette use but with decreased odds of cannabis use and cigarette use. Intramurals were found to be protective against cannabis use and cigarette use among all students and e-cigarette use among females. Although varsity sports were protective against cannabis and cigarette use, they were found to be a risk factor for binge drinking and e-cigarette use. Substance use prevention efforts should be a focus among school varsity sports teams, especially for binge drinking and e-cigarette use.",

We aimed to assess the associations of cultural origins and socioeconomic factors with any breastfeeding initiation and duration in homeless families. We analyzed data from 456 children aged 6\u2009months to 5\u2009years from the cross\u2010sectional ENFAMS survey, conducted in 2013 among a random sample of homeless families in shelters in the Greater Paris area. Data were collected by bilingual interviewers in 17 languages. Four nested multivariable robust Poisson regression models were run in a hierarchical framework to determine the factors associated with breastfeeding initiation and with any breastfeeding for 6\u2009months or more. Most of the children (86.0%) had previously been or were currently being breastfed at the time of the survey; 58.9% were fed with breast milk \u22656\u2009months. A higher maternal age and African origin were positively associated with breastfeeding \u22656\u2009months, although the relation to the region of origin was moderated by education level. Migration to escape war, unrest or other violence and the child's birth in France were inversely associated with breastfeeding \u22656\u2009months. Any breastfeeding by these homeless mothers seems influenced predominantly by their cultural origin and complicated by a difficult migration trajectory. The possible influence of poor material circumstances and cumulative hardship should encourage interventions targeted at homeless mothers that emphasize social/family support with a commitment to improving the family's living conditions.",

Twenty patients with a visual analog scale (VAS) sweating score \u2265 8 cm were randomized to receive lidocaine 2% (5 mL) delivered by JetPeel\u2122-3 followed by multiple injections of BTX-A (100 units) or lidocaine 2% (5 mL) and BTX-A (50 units) delivered together by JetPeel\u2122-3. Effect of treatment on sweating was measured by VAS (0= minimum sweating; 10= maximum sweating) at 3-month follow-up. Pain induced by the procedure was assessed by VAS (0= minimum pain; 10= maximum pain) immediately after the procedure. Patient satisfaction was assessed at 3-month follow-up using a 5-point scale (1= not at all satisfied; 2= not satisfied; 3= partially satisfied; 4= satisfied; 5= highly satisfied). Both treatment modalities reduced sweating at 3-month follow-up, if compared with baseline (all P <0.001). Delivery of lidocaine and BTX-A by JetPeel\u2122-3 resulted in lower procedure-related pain and reduced sweating, if compared with lidocaine delivered by JetPeel\u2122-3 followed by multiple BTX-A injections (all P <0.001). Patient satisfaction with the procedure was higher in the group receiving lidocaine and BTX-A treatment by JetPeel\u2122-3, if compared with lidocaine delivered by JetPeel\u2122-3 followed by multiple BTX-A injections ( P <0.001). No side effects were observed in both groups. Lidocaine and BTX-A can be safely delivered together by JetPeel\u2122-3 to treat primary palmar, plantar and axillary hyperhidrosis, resulting in lower procedure-related pain, improved sweating and higher patient satisfaction, if compared with lidocaine delivered by JetPeel\u2122-3 followed by standard BTX-A injection therapy. Our protocol delivering lidocaine and BTX-A together by JetPeel\u2122-3 requires a reduced quantity of BTX-A, further supporting the use of the transdermal drug delivery by jet nebulization over standard injection therapy for treatment of primary hyperhidrosis.",

Women enrolled in the DEGRA Database at the Clinic of Affective Disorders in Pregnancy and Postpartum in Italy, treated during pregnancy with escitalopram and followed up throughout pregnancy, were included in this study. All patients provided written informed consent and the study was approved by the local ethics committee. Psychiatric diagnoses were assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Fourth Edition) Axis I Disorders and symptoms were assessed using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (17 items) and Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (14 items). Clinical and sociodemographic characteristics as well as maternal and neonatal outcomes were recorded. The case histories of seven pregnant women treated for depression and/or anxiety disorders with escitalopram were reported. Four women were also treated with benzodiazepines. All pregnancies were full-term and all newborns had normal Apgar scores. There were no major malformations or miscarriages following exposure to escitalopram. Mild withdrawal syndrome was reported only in a newborn who was also exposed to a benzodiazepine. Two infants exposed to escitalopram during breastfeeding did not show any health problems. Our experience with use of escitalopram in pregnant women did not reveal any maternal or neonatal concerns. However, considering the few cases analyzed and the paucity of published literature, no conclusions can be drawn on its safety profile in pregnancy and breastfeeding.",

A 42-year-old woman with a history of chronic kidney disease as a result of chronic laxative abuse from a purging type of anorexia nervosa (AN-P), developed an anuric AKI requiring hemodialysis and a mild AKI 2 months later. Both episodes of AKI involved severe to moderate hypokalemia (1.2 and 2.7\u00a0mmol/L, respectively), volume depletion, and mild rhabdomyolysis. The histologic findings of the first AKI revealed the remnants of acute tubular necrosis with advanced chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis and ischemic glomerular injury. Along with these observations, the intertwined relationship among precipitants of recurrent AKI in AN-P is discussed, and then we postulate a contributory role of hypokalemia involved in the pathophysiology of the renal ischemia-induced AKI.",

    "abstract": "Heat-based approaches have been considered as promising tools due to their ability to directly eradicate tumor cells and/or increase the sensitivity of tumors to radiation- or chemotherapy. In particular, the heating of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) via an alternating magnetic field can provide a handy alternative for a localized tumor treatment. To amplify the efficacy of magnetically induced thermal treatments, we elucidated the superior tumor-destructive effect of methotrexate-coupled MNPs (MTX/MNPs) in combination with magnetic heating (nanochemothermia) over the thermal treatment alone. Our studies in a murine bladder xenograft model revealed the enormous potential of nanochemothermia for a localized and relapse-free destruction of tumors which was superior to the thermal treatment alone. Nanochemothermia remarkably fostered the reduction of tumor volume. It impaired proapoptotic signaling (eg, p-p53), cell survival (eg, p-ERK1/2), and cell cycle (cyclins) pathways. Additionally, heat shock proteins (eg, HSP70) were remarkably affected. Moreover, nanochemothermia impaired the induction of angiogenic signaling by decreasing, for example, the levels of VEGF-R1 and MMP9, although an increasing tumor hypoxia was indicated by elevated Hif-1\u03b1 levels. In contrast, tumor cells were able to recover after the thermal treatments alone. In conclusion, nanochemothermia on the basis of MTX/MNPs was superior to the thermal treatment due to a modification of cellular pathways, particularly those associated with the cellular survival and tumor vasculature. This allowed very efficient and relapse-free destruction of tumors.",

    "abstract": "The aim of the present study was to explore the classification of the internal iliac artery (IIA) and the diagnostic value of the pelvic tumour-feeding artery by multislice computed tomography angiography (MSCTA) compared with digital subtraction angiography (DSA). A total of 43 patients with pelvic tumours were enrolled between January 2013 and August 2017. The classification of the IIA and the quality of the feeding artery of the pelvic tumours were analysed by Yamaki's classification (Groups A-D according to IIA branching) and the 5-point scoring system. The degree of feeding artery stenosis, caused by tumour compression or invasion, was analysed by a 4-point scoring system. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to determine the vascular diagnostic quality identified by MSCTA and DSA. MSCTA of the pelvic arteries was successfully performed in all patients. The main classifications of the IIA were Group A, followed by Group C, then Group B and with no cases of Group D. There was no significant difference in the classification of the IIA between the left and right sides on MSCTA and DSA. The visualization quality of the IIA and its main branches showed excellent consistency, but the difference in the terminal branches of the feeding arteries in the pelvic tumours was statistically significant between MSCTA and DSA. MSCTA has great advantages in evaluating the classification of the IIA, the imaging quality evaluation of the IIA and its main branches, and in the evaluation of the pelvic tumour-feeding artery. However, in the display of the terminal arterial branches of the pelvic tumours, DSA remains irreplaceable, particularly in cases of interventional embolization.",

This period is very important for child development, so complementary feeding (CF) practices should be optimized to maximize children's potential for growth and development. The aim of this study was to analyze the CF practices and nutritional status of children aged 6\u201323 months. For this cross-sectional study, 392 children aged 6\u201323 months were selected using stratified random sampling. Socio-demographic data were collected through interviews. CF practices, collected by interviews and repeated 24-hour food recall method, were the timely introduction of CF, minimum meal frequency, dietary diversity and minimum acceptable diet, consumption food rich in proteins and vitamin A. Nutritional status was assessed using the indicators of underweight, wasting and stunting. To analyze the association between socio-demographic indicators and CF with nutritional status, the chi-square test with a confidence interval of 95% was used. Results showed that 39% were exclusively breastfed, only 61% received prolonged breastfeeding and 50% received timely introduction of CF. Minimum meal frequency was met by 74% of subjects, but dietary diversity and minimum acceptable diet were only realized in 50% and 40% of the children, respectively. The prevalence of underweight, wasting, and stunting were 26%, 23%, and 28%, respectively. Age of the child, birth order, birth weight, parents' education level, family size and incidence of fever and diarrhea during the previous two weeks were associated with underweight, while child's birth order, fathers' education level, mother's age, family size, completion of the age-appropriate vaccination and fish consumption frequency were associated with wasting. Age of the child, incidence of fever and acute respiratory infection, and fortified food consumption were associated with stunting. Suboptimal CF practices and high prevalence of underweight, wasting and stunting were found among children aged 6\u201323 months old in Aceh. These results highlight the need to improve CF and nutritional status.",

The purpose of this descriptive survey is to explore health-related feared possible selves in relation to dietary beliefs and behavior in adults. A convenience sample of 74 middle-aged employees of a health maintenance organization completed self-administered questionnaires. Health-related feared selves, current health perception, knowledge of diet-health association, dietary self-efficacy, dietary intention and intake were measured. Health-related fears were the most frequently reported feared selves, but very few of those represented illnesses and none were related to dietary intake. The number of health and body weight related fears was significantly associated with lower dietary self-efficacy and weaker intention to eat in a healthy manner. Multivariate analysis showed self-efficacy to be the only significant predictor of dietary intention. These adults may not have perceived being at risk for diet-associated illnesses, and so their feared selves did not motivate them to eat in a healthy manner. Research on the effect of hoped for health related possible selves and the perceived effectiveness of diet in reducing health risk are recommended.",

    "abstract": "Functional imaging data in adult patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) support a dysfunctional signal in the ventral striatum as neural signature of AN. In the present study, development of this signal was investigated with the prediction that a characteristic pattern of ventral\u2013striatal signalling will be shown in response to cues associated with food restriction that reflects the evolvement of starvation dependence over time. The signal was assessed in adolescent patients with AN, whose duration of illness was about five times shorter relative to the adult sample. During functional magnetic resonance imaging subjects were required to estimate weights of body images (underweight, normal weight, overweight) and to process each stimulus in a self-referring way. Relative to age-matched, young healthy controls, underweight stimuli were already associated with greater activity of the ventral striatum, and processing of normal-weight stimuli elicited already reduced signalling. Subjective preferences showed exactly the same pattern of results. Relative to adult AN, the present data reveal a developing dysfunctional signal that, if untreated, will essentially contribute to the maintenance of AN. We discuss putative mechanisms that may play a crucial role in the development of AN, and also deduce new hypotheses about the involvement of the midbrain dopamine system, of which illness-related alterations may contribute to the development of AN.",

The infant exposure to maternally ingested metyrapone through breast milk is, however, largely unknown. We report the excretion of metyrapone into breast milk and subsequent infant exposure from a lactating woman on 250 mg of metyrapone three times daily. Due to limited supply of breast milk, the infant was fed \u223c50% breast milk and 50% formula. At steady state, the average concentrations in the studied breast milk and absolute and relative infant doses were 176 \u00b5g/L, 26.45 \u00b5g/kg/d, and 0.7%, respectively, for metyrapone, and 310 \u00b5g/L, 46.52 \u00b5g/kg/d, and 1.21% for its active metabolite metyrapol. The breastfed infant was found to have a plasma metyrapone concentration of 0.05 \u00b5g/L, with no evidence of disruption to his adrenocortical axis biochemically. These findings indicate that maternal metyrapone use during breastfeeding did not pose a notable risk to this breastfed infant. The infants\u2019 exposure to metyrapone was further minimized by avoiding nursing for 2 to 3 hours after each metyrapone dose.",

Nine evidence-based clinical treatment guidelines for eating disorders were located through a systematic search. The international comparison demonstrated notable commonalities and differences among these current clinical guidelines. Evidence-based clinical guidelines represent an important step toward the dissemination and implementation of evidence-based treatments into clinical practice. Despite advances in clinical research on eating disorders, a growing body of literature demonstrates that individuals with eating disorders often do not receive an evidence-based treatment for their disorder. Regarding the dissemination and implementation of evidence-based treatments, current guidelines do endorse the main empirically validated treatment approaches with considerable agreement, but additional recommendations are largely inconsistent. An increased evidence base is critical in offering clinically useful and reliable guidance for the treatment of eating disorders. Because developing and updating clinical guidelines is time-consuming and complex, an international coordination of guideline development, for example, across the European Union, would be desirable.",

In a cross-sectional study, 255 individuals who were overweight and seeking treatment for BED completed the Weight Bias Internalization Scale (WBIS), Short-Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36), and Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI). Regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the relationship between the WBIS and the SF-36, and bootstrapping mediation analyses were conducted to test whether BDI scores mediated this relationship. Higher weight bias internalization was associated with poorer self-reported health on all scales of the SF-36, and BDI scores mediated the relationship. Additional analyses revealed that WBIS scores also mediated the relationship between BDI scores and three SF-36 scales. Weight bias internalization is associated with poorer overall mental and physical health, and depressive symptoms may play a role in accounting for this relationship in treatment-seeking overweight patients with BED.",

We also found that the reverse feeding (RF) schedule (up to 8 weeks) might induce an adaptable metabolic stress and cause impairment of androgen-dependent reproductive tissues. In the present study, we extended the RF time regimen up to 12 weeks, and measured the reproductive tissue weights. After 4 and 8 weeks of RF, the weights of epididymis were not significantly different. After 12 weeks, however, epididymis weights of RF animals were significantly different (CON 12W : RF 12W = 48.26\u00b10.62 mg : 44.05\u00b11.57 mg, p <0.05). After 4 and 12 weeks of feeding, seminal vesicle weights of RF animals were significantly decreased (CON 4W : RF 4W = 79.36\u00b18.34 mg : 46.28\u00b12.43 mg, p <0.001; CON 12W : RF 12W = 72.04\u00b13.76 mg : 46.71\u00b12.27 mg, p <0.001, respectively). Prostate weights were not changed by RF. Kidney and spleen weights of RF animals were significantly different on weeks 4 and 12 (Kidney, CON 4W : RF 4W = 249.72\u00b14.20 mg : 228.41\u00b13.03 mg, p <0.001; CON 12W : RF 12W = 309.15\u00b17.49 mg : 250.72\u00b16.13 mg, p <0.001, respectively, Spleen, CON 4W : RF 4W = 111.26\u00b13.76 mg : 96.88\u00b14.69 mg, p <0.05; CON 12W : RF 12W = 123.93\u00b110.72 mg : 94.68\u00b15.65 mg, p <0.05, respectively). Histology analysis of seminal vesicle revealed that the thinner epithelial cell layers, reduced complexities of swollen papilla folding in the exocrine glands on weeks 4 and 12 of RF. There was no histological difference between control and RF group on week 8. The present study indicates that up to 12 weeks RF induced differential changes in tissue weights of male mice. In particular, seminal vesicle, kidney and spleen seemed to temporarily adapted to the RF-induced metabolic stress on week 8 of feeding schedule. These results confirmed the our previous study that the RF might induce an adaptable metabolic stress and cause impairment of androgen-dependent reproductive tissues such as epididymis and seminal vesicle as well as non-reproductive tissues such as kidney and spleen. Further studies will be needed to achieve a better understanding of the how does mealtime shift affect the reproductive function and exact nature of adaptation.",

We used a single survey to collect retrospective self-report data from a convenience sample of Canadian undergraduate students ( n =\u200998) about their motivation, engagement and perceptions of success and cheating before COVID-19 and then in remote learning. Students' achievement goals, engagement and perceptions of success all significantly decreased, while their perceptions of cheating increased. Moreover, we used regression analyses to examine associations amongst achievement goals and engagement, perceptions of success and cheating concerns. Mastery-approach goals were positively associated with more engagement and higher perceptions of success. Achievement goals were unrelated to cheating. Students in large classes and who were originally concerned about cheating became more concerned about cheating in remote learning conditions. Our study provides information to researchers and instructors about how achievement goals relate to student outcomes across learning conditions. By extension, we provide timely recommendations for instructors as they continue to wrestle with how to deliver their courses during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

We compared birth experience during the COVID-19 pandemic (March 15, 2020\u2013May 11, 2020) to a pre-pandemic response period (January 1, 2020\u2013March 14, 2020). We estimated risk ratios for associations between birth experience and anxiety, depressive symptoms, stress, birth-related PTSD, emergency department visits, timely postpartum visit, and exclusive breastfeeding. Multivariable models adjusted for age, race-ethnicity, insurance, education, parity, BMI, previous experience of maltreatment/abuse and cesarean delivery. Women who gave birth during the peak of the pandemic response, and those that were SARS-CoV-2 positive, Black, and Latina, had lower birth satisfaction and higher perceived health care discrimination. Women with lower birth satisfaction were more likely to report higher postpartum anxiety, stress, depressive symptoms, and lower exclusive breastfeeding. Experiencing one or more incident of health care discrimination was associated with higher levels of postpartum stress and birth-related PTSD. Hospitals and policy-makers should institute measures to safeguard against a negative birth experience during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among birthing people of color.",

    "abstract": " Objective This study aimed to determine the prevalence of confirmed novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease or infants under investigation among a cohort of U.S. neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). Secondarily, to evaluate hospital policies regarding maternal COVID-19 screening and related to those infants born to mothers under investigation or confirmed to have COVID-19.  Study Design Serial cross-sectional surveys of MEDNAX-affiliated NICUs from March 26 to April 3, April 8 to April 19, May 4 to May 22, and July 13 to August 2, 2020. The surveys included questions regarding COVID-19 patient burden and policies regarding infant separation, feeding practices, and universal maternal screening.  Results Among 386 MEDNAX-affiliated NICUs, responses were received from 153 (42%), 160 (44%), 165 (45%), 148 (38%) across four rounds representing an active patient census of 3,465, 3,486, 3,452, and 3,442 NICU admitted patients on the day of survey completion. Confirmed COVID-19 disease in NICU admitted infants was rare, with the prevalence rising from 0.03 (1 patient) to 0.44% (15 patients) across the four survey rounds, while the prevalence of patients under investigation increased from 0.8 to 2.6%. Hospitals isolating infants from COVID-19-positive mothers fell from 46 to 20% between the second and fourth surveys, while centers permitting direct maternal breastfeeding increased 17 to 47% over the same period. Centers reporting universal severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) screening for all expectant mothers increased from 52 to 69%.  Conclusion Among a large cohort of NICU infants, the prevalence of infants under investigation or with confirmed neonatal COVID-19 disease was low. Policies regarding universal maternal screening for SARS-CoV-2, infant isolation from positive mothers, and direct maternal breastfeeding for infants born to positive mothers are rapidly evolving. As universal maternal screening for SARS-CoV-2 becomes more common, the impact of these policies requires further investigation.  Key Points  In this cohort, neonatal COVID-19 is rare. Policies regarding isolation and breastfeeding for infants are rapidly evolving. Most hospitals are now providing universal screening for expectant mothers for SARS-CoV-2.",

    "abstract": "The United States has one of the lowest exclusive breastfeeding rates among high-income countries. Most experts agree that there is a lack of mother-friendly workplace policies compared to other countries. Since 1995, 25 states have implemented workplace breastfeeding legislation allowing mothers to express and store breast milk in the workplace. There is heterogeneity in policy enforceability where 17 states have weak enforceability while eight states have strict enforceability and require employers to offer provisions to breastfeed at the workplace. Using difference-in-differences methods, we examine the impact of this policy on state-level breastfeeding rates and assess how that impact differs with policy enforceability. We use data from the Centers for Disease Control on breastfeeding, supplementing with socio-economic data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, Current Population Survey, the US Census Bureau and several other datasets over 22 years from 1990 to 2011. We find that states with legislation experienced a 2.3-percentage point increase in breastfeeding rates compared to states without legislation while states with weak enforceability experienced a 3.1-percentage point increase compared to states without legislation. We also find that policies do not start to have an impact until 1\u20132 years after they were signed into law. Considering the recent assault on breastfeeding from the current administration, our study is a timely and important contribution that strengthens the evidence base for the health benefits of workplace breastfeeding policies. \u2022 Some US states have passed workplace breastfeeding policies to allow mothers to pump milk in the workplace. \u2022 We assess the impact of such policies in the US on breastfeeding rates considering the heterogeneity of the policy. \u2022 States with workplace breastfeeding policies experienced a 2.3-percentage point increase in breastfeeding rates. \u2022 The policy impact differed by enforceability of the policy. \u2022 Workplace breastfeeding policies can be an avenue to help stagnant breastfeeding rates.

    "abstract": "Restrictive food intake in anorexia nervosa (AN) has been related to an overactive cognitive control network inhibiting intuitive motivational responses to food stimuli. However, the influence of short-term homeostatic signaling on the neural regulation of cue-induced food craving in AN is still unclear. Twenty-five women with AN and 25 matched normal-weight women were examined on two occasions after receiving either glucose or water directly into their stomach using a nasogastric tube. Participants were blinded to the type of infusion. An event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm was used to investigate the effect of intestinal glucose load on neural processing during either simple viewing or distraction from food stimuli. Neural differences between patients with AN and normal-weight participants were found during the distraction from food stimuli, but not during the viewing condition. When compared to controls, patients with AN displayed increased activation during food distraction in the left parietal lobule/precuneus and fusiform gyrus after water infusion and decreased activation in ventromedial prefrontal and cingulate regions after intestinal glucose load. Independent of the cephalic phase and the awareness of caloric intake, homeostatic influences trigger disorder-specific reactions in AN. Food distraction in patients with AN is associated with either excessive higher-order cognitive control during physiological hunger or decreased internally directed attention after intestinal glucose load. These findings suggest that food distraction plays an important role in the psychopathology of AN. This study was registered on clinicaltrials.gov with identifier: NCT03075371.",

    "abstract": "Although significant health improvements are indicated from weight-loss following bariatric surgery, many individuals are unable to lose weight or maintain their weight-loss. The current study aimed to assess whether post-surgery care comprising Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT), an emerging energy psychology intervention, combined with a behaviour-based nutrition and portion control eating plan in an online self-guided delivery would aid weight-loss and maintenance in bariatric patients. A 6-month randomised controlled parallel-group trial. Participants ( N = 343; aged 21\u201369 years; BMI \u226530 kg/m 2 ) had undergone bariatric surgery (12 + months prior) and were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: Portion Perfection for Bariatric Patients (PPBP; n = 109), PPBP combined with an eight-week online self-paced EFT treatment ( n = 107), and a treatment as usual (TAU) control ( n = 127). Participants completed measures of BMI, emotional eating, uncontrolled eating, food cravings, and self-esteem at 8-week post-treatment ( n = 158) and 6-month follow-up ( n = 109). Mixed-design analyses of variances were conducted to examine the effect of the interventions on outcome measures (pre-intervention, 8-week post-intervention, and 6-month follow-up). Emotional eating decreased significantly from pre-intervention to post-intervention for the PPBP and PPBP with EFT groups, and at 6-month follow-up for the TAU group only. There were no statistically significant between-group differences in other outcome variables. However, at 6-months the PPBP with EFT group experienced the greatest improvements in emotional eating (-16.33%), uncontrolled eating (-9.36%), and self-esteem (+4.43%), compared to PPBP only or TAU. The effect of EFT combined with the eating plan on psychological variables was largely inconsistent with prior research and discussion of how this may be optimised in future trials is discussed.

    "abstract": "Whilst psychological therapies are the main approach to treatment of eating disorders (EDs), advances in aetiological research suggest the need for the development of more targeted, brain-focused treatments. A range of neurostimulation approaches, most prominently repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and deep brain stimulation (DBS), are rapidly emerging as potential novel interventions. We have previously reviewed these techniques as potential treatments of EDs. To provide an update of the literature examining the effects of DBS, rTMS and tDCS on eating behaviours, body weight and associated symptoms in people with EDs and relevant analogue populations. Using PRISMA guidelines, we reviewed articles in PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycINFO from 1 st January 2013 until 14 th August 2017, to update our earlier search. Studies assessing the effects of neurostimulation techniques on eating and weight-related outcomes in people with EDs and relevant analogue populations were included. Data from both searches were combined. We included a total of 32 studies (526 participants); of these, 18 were newly identified by our update search. Whilst findings are somewhat mixed for bulimia nervosa, neurostimulation techniques have shown potential in the treatment of other EDs, in terms of reduction of ED and associated symptoms. Studies exploring cognitive, neural, and hormonal correlates of these techniques are also beginning to appear. Neurostimulation approaches show promise as treatments for EDs. As yet, large well-conducted randomised controlled trials are lacking. More information is needed about treatment targets, stimulation parameters and mechanisms of action.",

Comparable amounts of their respective diets were given at 05:30 and 15:00 throughout the experimental periods to make all the treatments consumed the same type of food and the same amount of calories on a daily basis. On day 30, one pig was randomly selected per litter for blood samples. Compared with the control group, ADG in the H-L and L-H groups increased by 8.11% and 16.23%, but not significant ( P >\u00a00.05); and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in the H-L and L-H groups decreased by 26.76% and 41.04% ( P <\u00a00.05), respectively. The H-L group feeding pattern could significantly improve levels of serum superoxide dismutase (SOD), when compared with the control group. These findings suggest that the two-meal daily feeding pattern with varied levels of CP affects serum levels of BUN and SOD. These changes could effectively silightly improve growth performance and antioxidant capacity in pigs without incurring increased feeding costs.",

Calves (n \ua78a 48) were randomly assigned to one of two experimental treatments including a conventional (CF) or an intensified feeding (IF) groups. In CF group, calves (n \ua78a 24) received 0.52 kg of dry matter (DM) per day from pasteurized whole milk (23.00% crude protein (CP) and 27.00% fat) until day 50 of age. In IF group, calves (n = 24) fed 0.97 kg of DM per day on average for the first three weeks, and then, milk allowance decreased gradually to reach 0.52 kg DM per day and continued until day 50. All calves were gradually weaned from day 51 to 56. Blood samples were taken on days 14, 28, and 57 at 06:30 AM for serum amyloid A (SAA), cortisol, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and iron analyses. Conventionally fed calves had more days with fever during the pre-weaning period. Blood SAA and cortisol levels were higher in CF calves on day 14. However, SAA levels were higher for IF calves on day 57. Intensified milk-fed calves spent more time for standing than CF calves. A trend to be significant was observed for non-nutritive oral behavior in IF calves. In summary, dairy calf health can be improved by intensified milk feeding during the pre-weaning period; however, this method has the potential to reduce calves welfare around weaning transition.",

Intraoperative assessment of the repaired mucosa integrity for adequate closure may reduce PCF, but this is not routinely done. The objective of this study is to describe a novel technique that has been successfully used to ascertain intraoperative pharyngeal repair integrity. Thirty-one patients who had total laryngectomy and pharyngeal reconstruction for locally advanced laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma were studied. Connell extramucosal suturing technique was used for the mucosal repair. Thereafter, a small feeding tube was introduced through the oral cavity to the site of the pharyngeal repair, and diluted methylene-blue dye was injected through it while digitally occluding the cervical esophagus. Whenever leakage of the dye was seen, the leakage site (s) was repaired. Thereafter, the dye test would be repeated to confirm the integrity of the repair. Their mean age was 53.4 \u00b1 10.9 years. Seven (22.6%) patients had Stage 3 disease and 24 (77.4%) had Stage 4 disease. All the patients had neck dissection, whereas 3 (9.7%) patients had salvage laryngectomy postradiotherapy. Dye test was performed intraoperatively for all the patients and leakages were seen in 4 (12.9%) patients which were successfully repaired. Oral feeding was commenced on the fifth postoperative day, and none of the patients had PCF. Performing a dye test intraoperatively helps detect the point of leakage and immediate repair will prevent PCF.",

The Korean version of the EDI-2 was prepared after comprehensive clinical assessment of Korean patients with eating disorders (n=327) as well as female undergraduates (n=176). Results were compared between eating disorder subgroups (anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and eating disorders not otherwise specified) and those of a North American standardization sample and healthy controls. The results showed that the Korean EDI-2 had adequate internal consistency (0.77-0.93) and discriminated well between patients with eating disorders and healthy controls on all subscales. Significant differences in EDI-2 subscale scores between the eating disorder groups and the healthy control group were observed; however, there was no discernible difference among the eating disorder subgroups. When compared with a North American standardization sample, the Korean control group showed significantly higher scores for drive for thinness and asceticism. When patient groups were compared, the Korean group showed significantly lower scores for perfectionism. As expected, the results accurately reflected psychometric properties of the Korean version of EDI-2 for eating disorder patients in Korea. These findings also suggest that common characteristics for the eating disorder exist as a whole rather than with significant difference between each subgroup. In addition, significant differences between the Korean and the North American groups for both patients and controls also demonstrated specific cultural differences.",

Currently, no cross-sectional data are available on the experiences and attitudes of mothers regarding the use of herbal and pharmaceutical galactagogues for lactation in the US. The findings of an online survey of 188 breastfeeding mothers on experiences with and sources of information on galactagogues are presented. Most mothers (76%) reported that while breastfeeding, they felt as though they were not making enough milk to meet the needs of their child, and yet 54% also indicated that they had not supplemented with formula. A large proportion of respondents reported utilizing galactagogues to increase lactation and finding them useful. The results indicated that most women learned about galactagogues from the Internet or by word of mouth through friends. Lactation consultants were the third-most reported sources of information on these products. While many respondents reported perceiving galactagogues as innocuous, more evidence on safety and efficacy is needed to support women properly who seek out and use them. Large-scale studies of the prevalence of galactagogue use in the US and rigorous evaluation of use globally are needed to ensure that mothers who choose to breastfeed may safely avail themselves of all options when counseling support is insufficient.",

In comparison to controls, cases had lower score on HEI (61 vs. 70.07; P< 0.001), and higher score on MSDP (26.20 vs. 24.49; P= 0.44). After comparing the highest and the lowest tertile of HEI, we observed a significant decreasing trend in the risk of PC (p for trend<0.001). Our findings suggested that a high quality diet, according to HEI, may decrease the risk of PC.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of granulomatous mastitis (GLM) in multiparae as seriously affected the quality of life and breastfeeding of pregnant women after delivery, but the treatment is rarely reported. In this article, the development, healing, and lactation of 13 cases were reported and a retrospective analysis was performed. 10 cases of GLM were treated at the Breast Disease Prevention and Treatment Center of Haidian Maternal & Child Health Hospital of Beijing and 3 cases of GLM were treated in the Breast Department of Weihai Municipal Hospital of Shandong province from February 2017 to May 2019. Among the 13 patients, conservative symptomatic treatment was adopted during pregnancy and lactation: anti-infective therapy consisting of oral cephalosporin antibiotic for patients; ultrasound-guided puncture and drainage of pus or incision and drainage after abscess formation. Observation continued during the sinus tract phase. Postpartum breastfeeding was encouraged, especially on the affected side. In this study, the median healing time was 20\u200amonths and the average healing time was 30.4\u200amonths in 5 healthy breast lactation cases. In 8 cases of bilateral breast lactation, the median healing time was 30\u200amonths and the average healing time was 26.5\u200amonths. Linear regression test analysis: whether the affected breast was breast-fed after delivery had no effect on the postpartum wound healing time, P =\u200a.792. The wounds of 13 patients healed well after lactation, and none of them recurred since the last follow-up visit. There were no adverse events in all infants. Conservative symptomatic treatment for GLM of multiparous women during pregnancy and lactation and encouraging breastfeeding after delivery have no effect on infant health and the recovery time of patients.",

    "abstract": "Although a complexity of factors explain early cessation of breastfeeding, the encounter of a problem is often a critical point in this decision. For this reason, breastfeeding self\u2010efficacy, a mother's evaluations of her ability to successfully overcome challenges, is an effective target in interventions to sustain breastfeeding. This study examined factors affecting the success of one such intervention, reactive telephone support. Across a 4\u2010week period, recordings of all calls to a nurse\u2010staffed parent helpline in Queensland, Australia were made. Of these calls, 60 were from mothers encountering a breastfeeding problem. Using a standard protocol, each call was scored for trajectories of mother's breastfeeding self\u2010efficacy from opening to close of call. Calls showing an upward trajectory were defined as supporting (53%), those with no change were defined as ineffective (25%), and those with downward trajectory as undermining (22%). Using trajectory scores, case exemplars were purposively selected for detailed analysis of interactional sequences to identify strategies that distinguished outcome. The supportive call was distinguished by information sharing, mutual trust and respectful relationships, and personalized affirmation and advice. The ineffective call focused on technical aspects of breastfeeding, whereas the undermining call made moral judgements of mother's behaviour. The findings identify interactional quality of telephone support, not simply provision, as the key success factor in reactive telephone support. The findings also present interactional quality as a potential explanation for inconsistent outcomes in evaluation of reactive telehealth interventions to support breastfeeding.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to assess the dietary behaviors of preschool children using the nutrition quotient for preschoolers (NQ-P) and analyzed the difference in the scores of the children's dietary behaviors in regards to the parents' health consciousness. The subjects were 257 children aged 3\u20135 years and their parents residing in Seoul and Gyeonggi-do, South Korea. The questionnaire is composed of demographic characteristics, the NQ-P questions, and health consciousness. All data were statistically analyzed by SPSS program (ver. 25.0) and the statistical differences in variables were evaluated by \u03c7 2 test, Fisher's exact test, t-test, 1-way analysis of variance and Tukey's multiple comparison test. There was a significant difference on the intake frequency of processed meat by region and fast foods by age, region, and weight status ( P < 0.05). There was also a significant difference in not moving around while eating by weight status and parents' effort to have healthy eating habits by sex ( P < 0.05). The mean score of NQ-P of the total subjects was 59.47, which was within the medium-low grade. The mean score of balance was 61.62, and the boys were significantly higher than girls ( P < 0.05). As the age of children increased, the mean score of the moderation was significantly decreased ( P < 0.05). The scores of NQ-P ( P < 0.05), balance ( P < 0.01), and environment ( P < 0.05) were significantly higher in the high group of parents' health consciousness than the low group. According to the results of the evaluation by NQ-P, the dietary behaviors of preschoolers residing in Seoul and Gyeonggi-do need to be improved. For improving their eating behavior and nutritional health status, parents and children need customized nutrition education programs based on sex, age, region and weight status of preschool children as well as the degree of parents' health consciousness.",

Anamorelin (ONO\u20107643; ANAM) is a novel and selective ghrelin receptor agonist that improves appetite, lean body mass (LBM), body weight, and anorexia. This multicenter, open\u2010label, single\u2010arm study investigated the efficacy and safety of 100\u00a0mg anamorelin in 50 Japanese patients with advanced and unresectable gastrointestinal (colorectal, gastric, or pancreatic) cancer. ANAM was administered once daily over 12\u00a0weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients that maintained or gained LBM over the course of the study. Secondary endpoints included changes in LBM, body weight, quality of life (QoL), and nutritional status biomarkers. The proportion of patients who responded to treatment was 63.3% (95% CI, 48.3%\u201076.6%), with a least square mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SE change in LBM and body weight from baseline of 1.89\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.36\u00a0kg and 1.41\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.61\u00a0kg, respectively. Appetite\u2010related questions on the QoL questionnaire showed that ANAM improved appetite. Adverse events occurred in 79.6% of patients, and the most common treatment\u2010related adverse events were increased \u03b3\u2010glutamyl transpeptidase (8.2%), diabetes mellitus (6.1%), hyperglycemia (6.1%), and prolonged QRS complex (6.1%). ANAM improved anorexia and patients' nutritional status, resulting in rapid increases in LBM and body weight in patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer who had cancer cachexia. ANAM treatment was well tolerated over 12\u00a0weeks. ANAM is a potential clinically beneficial pharmacotherapeutic option for patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer who have cancer cachexia. The receipt of 100\u00a0mg anamorelin increases lean body mass and improves symptoms of anorexia and nutritional status in patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer who have cancer cachexia. Anamorelin is well tolerated in these patients.",

A total of 697 infants were tested at age 12, 24, and 36 months using the Korean version of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II (K-BSID-II). The use and duration of breastfeeding and formula feeding were measured. The relationship between breastfeeding and the mental development index (MDI) score was analyzed by multiple linear regression analysis. The results indicated a positive correlation between breastfeeding duration and MDI score. After adjusting for covariates, infants who were breastfed for \u2265 9 months had significantly better cognitive development than those who had not been breastfed.

    "abstract": " The development of transcatheter techniques for treatment of severe mitral valve regurgitation in the beating heart is focus of recent research. An off-pump treatment technique poses great benefits, particularly for multimorbid patients, often being non-compliant to the gold standard treatment, being open heart surgery with use of a cardiopulmonary bypass. Thereto, two approaches are being followed: transcatheter valve repair and transcatheterimplantation of a valved stent into the native mitral valve annulus. A valved stent has to provide safe and secure fixation within the high pressure system of the left heart. One of the main challenges in the development of such a valved stent is the complex anatomy of the mitral valve, with no clearly defined structures for device anchorage. Our group has developed a self-expanding nitinolvalved stent for transapical implantation in the beating heart. During the development process of thevalved stent, different design iterations were conducted to decrease the risk of paravalvular leakages, to enhance the reproducibility and to improve the overall stent performance. This article reviews the major milestones passedin the development process of our mitral valved stent and advances achieved withinthe last years. Multiple design iterations lead to a prototype providing secure stent deployment, hig h reproducibility, low paravalvular leakages and only mild stent deformation in the beating heart. In future, further long-term in vivo trials have to be conducted before attempting the step towards clinical application of this novel device.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate the biological effectiveness of cancer therapy with tumor treating fields using a fractionated treatment scheme that was originally designed for radiotherapy. Discontinuous fractional tumor treating fields of an intensity of 0.9 to 1.2 V/cm and a frequency of 150 KHz were applied to U373 cancer cells and IEC6 normal cells for 3 days, with durations of 3, 6, 12, or 24 h/d. As the treatment duration of the tumor treating fields increased from 3 to 24 h/d, the relative tumor cell (U373) number (% of control) reduced in proportion to the treatment duration. Compared to a 25% cell number reduction (75% of control) for the group of 6 h/d treatment at 1.2 V/cm, only 5% (70% of control) and 8% (67% of control) of additional reductions were observed for the group of 12 and 24 h/d treatment, respectively. This experimental result indicates that the dependence on treatment duration in tumor cell inhibition was weakened distinctly at treatment duration over 6 h/d. For normal cells (IEC6), the relative cell number corresponding to the treatment time of the tumor treating fields at 1.2 V/cm of electric field strength was not decreased much for the treatment times of 3, 6, and 12 h/d, revealing 93.3%, 90.0%, and 89.3% relative cell numbers, respectively, but it suddenly decreased to \u223c73% for the 24 h/d treatment. Our results showed that the effects of tumor treating fields on tumor cells were higher than on normal cells for treatment duration of 3 to 12 h/d, but the difference became minimal for treatment duration of 24 h/d. The fractionated scheme, using tumor treating fields, reduced the treatment time while maintaining efficacy, suggesting that this method may be clinically applicable for cancer treatment.",

The tongue of the Muscovy ducks was distinguished grossly as the apex, body, and root. A dorsal median sulcus, conical papillae, and lingual prominence were observed grossly. Microscopic observations showed the tongue of the Muscovy duck was covered by stratified squamous epithelium; keratinized and non-keratinized. The lamina propria of the tongue contained lingual glands, entoglossum cartilage, lymphoid nodules, as well as blood vessels and nerves.

We used a standardized evidence-based questionnaire for the survey.

In 2017, 1.1% of all deaths that occurred in Swiss nursing homes or in a private home were owing to VSED. This phenomenon was classified as a natural dying process (59.3%), passive euthanasia (32.0%), or suicide (5.3%). Although about one in three Swiss family physicians have accompanied a person during VSED, family physicians lack sufficient in-depth knowledge to address patients and their relatives in an appropriate manner during the process.

Thirty-six 8-wk-old geese were allotted into one of three groups. Group R1 (the 1-step restricted feeding group) was allowed access to feed for 2 h in the morning from 8 wk to 14 wk of age. Group R2 (the 2-step restricted feeding group) was treated as Group R1, but was additionally fed for 2 h in the afternoon from 12 wk to 14 wk of age. Group C (the control group) was fed ad libitum from 8 wk to 14 wk of age. Feed intake and body weight (BW) were recorded daily and weekly, respectively. At 14 wk of age, the blood samples were collected to determine the fasting plasma levels of glucose, triacylglycerols and uric acid before sacrifice. The results showed that daily feed intake (DFI) was lower, feed efficiency (FE) was higher in both Groups R1 and R2 than in Group C, and daily gain (DG) in Group R2 was higher than in Group R1 during the whole experimental period (p<0.05). Group R1 exhibited lower abdominal and visceral fat weights in carcass than did Group C (p<0.05), and Group R2 was in intermediate. The fasting plasma glucose levels in Group C were higher, and triacylglycerol levels in Group R1 were higher, compared with the other groups (p<0.05). It is concluded that time-restricted feeding in the fattening period not only increases FE but reduces DFI, and the additional meal during the late fattening period improves the DG without the expense of FE in geese.",

Patients whose EEG data was used for clinical treatment reported significant decreases in associated depressive symptoms (HDRS scores), overall severity of illness (Clinical Global Impression-Severity), and overall clinical global improvement (Clinical Global Impression- Improvement). This cohort also reported fewer inpatient, residential, and partial hospitalization program days following referenced-EEG compared with the two-year period prior to treatment.

    "abstract": "The roles of corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF), opioid peptides, leptin and ghrelin in anorexia nervosa (AN) were discussed in this paper. CRF is the key mediator of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and also acts at various other parts of the brain, such as the limbic system and the peripheral nervous system. CRF action is mediated through the CRF1 and CRF2 receptors, with both HPA axis-dependent and HPA axis-independent actions, where the latter shows nil involvement of the autonomic nervous system. CRF1 receptors mediate both the HPA axis-dependent and independent pathways through CRF, while the CRF2 receptors exclusively mediate the HPA axis-independent pathways through urocortin. Opioid peptides are involved in the adaptation and regulation of energy intake and utilization through reward-related behavior. Opioids play a role in the addictive component of AN, as described by the \u201cauto-addiction opioids theory\u201d. Their interactions have demonstrated the psychological aspect of AN and have shown to prevent the functioning of the physiological homeostasis. Important opioids involved are \u03b2-lipotropin, \u03b2-endorphin and dynorphin, which interact with both \u00b5 and \u03ba opioids receptors to regulate reward-mediated behavior and describe the higher incidence of AN seen in females. Moreover, ghrelin is known as the \u201chunger\u201d hormone and helps stimulate growth hormone (GH) and hepatic insulin-like-growth-factor-1(IGF-1), maintaining anabolism and preserving a lean body mass. In AN, high levels of GH due to GH resistance along with low levels of IGF-1 are observed. Leptin plays a role in suppressing appetite through the inhibition of neuropeptide Y gene. Moreover, the CRF, opioid, leptin and ghrelin mechanisms operate collectively at the HPA axis and express the physiological and psychological components of AN. Fear conditioning is an intricate learning process occurring at the level of the hippocampus, amygdala, lateral septum and the dorsal raphe by involving three distinct pathways, the HPA axis-independent pathway, hypercortisolemia and ghrelin. Opioids mediate CRF through noradrenergic stimulation in association with the locus coeruleus. Furthermore, CRF's inhibitory effect on gonadotropin releasing hormone can be further explained by the direct relationship seen between CRF and opioids. Low levels of gonadotropin have been demonstrated in AN where only estrogen has shown to mediate energy intake. In addition, estrogen is involved in regulating \u00b5 receptor concentrations, but in turn both CRF and opioids regulate estrogen. Moreover, opioids and leptin are both an effect of AN, while many studies have demonstrated a causal relationship between CRF and anorexic behavior. Moreover, leptin, estrogen and ghrelin play a role as predictors of survival in starvation. Since both leptin and estrogen are associated with higher levels of bone marrow fat they represent a longer survival than those who favor the ghrelin pathway. Future studies should consider cohort studies involving prepubertal males and females with high CRF. This would help prevent the extrapolation of results from studies on mice and draw more meaningful conclusions in humans. Studies should also consider these mechanisms in post-AN patients, as well as look into what predisposes certain individuals to develop AN. Finally, due to its complex pathogenesis the treatment of AN should focus on both the pharmacological and behavioral perspectives.",

Children aged 24 to 48 months who were presented at the outpatient clinic of a single hospital over a 6-month period were included in the study. Children who were born prematurely, hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit, and those with a chronic disease were excluded. A questionnaire was administered to parents who provided consent. Data related to demographic characteristics, socioeconomic status, and infant nutrition practices were collected and analyzed. A total of 100 cases were included. The distribution of the gender of the children was 49% female and 51% male, and the mean age was 36.2\u00b17.8 months. The mean duration of exclusive breastfeeding was 4.83\u00b11.23 months, the mean length of total breastfeeding was 17.65\u00b18.44 months, and the mean initiation of complementary feeding was 5.71\u00b11.23 months of age. The most frequent reason provided for the cessation of breastfeeding was the mother\u2019s decision to wean. The duration of exclusive breastfeeding and the total length of breastfeeding feeding was significantly shorter among children who were born by cesarean section, and those who used a pacifier and or feeding bottle. Non-working mothers used formula for a longer period (p=0.043) and introduced solid foods and the use of utensils later than other mothers (p=0.001, p=0.03, respectively). Complementary food was provided to the infants of families whose monthly income level was less than TL 1000 earlier than in higher income level groups (p=0.04). The results of this study also showed that complementary food choices were most influenced by older members of the family and members of the mother\u2019s immediate circle (42%) and healthcare professionals (36%). Mothers who received information about the addition of complementary food did not demonstrate a significantly different length of time devoted to exclusive breastfeeding; however, the duration of breastfeeding overall, alone and in combination with solid foods, increased (p=0.03). Before the birth, families should be informed and prepared regarding the necessity of exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months and the continuation of breastfeeding until 2 years of age, the potential impact of relevant factors related to the type of birth, and the potentially negative effects of the use of a pacifier or bottle. All members of the family, particularly mothers and close relatives, should be advised about proper complementary feeding techniques, including the need to increase the consistency of food gradually, introducing solid foods before the 10th month, and using natural, home-cooked items instead of prepared foods. The appropriate information and guidance should be provided to all families with consideration for their education level, social environment, and life conditions.",

Electron microscopy revealed that a centrosome is an amorphous structure or pericentriolar protein matrix that surrounds a pair of well-organized centrioles. Today, the importance of the centrosome as a microtubule-organizing center and coordinator of the mitotic spindle is questioned, because centrioles are absent in up to half of all known eukaryotic species, and various mechanisms for acentrosomal microtubule nucleation have been described. This review recapitulates the known functions of centrosome movements in cellular homeostasis and discusses knowledge gaps in this field.

Sensory soothing strategies for sensory sensitivities are supportive tools which could be useful in day-care and inpatient clinical programmes. Evaluation of multiple separate sensory wellbeing workshops consisting of psychoeducation and experiential components delivered in inpatient and intensive day-care services was performed. Participants\u2019 self-report questionnaires were evaluated pre- and post-workshop. Additionally, patients\u2019 comments and qualitative feedback was collected after completion of the workshop. There was strong evidence that self-reported awareness of sensory wellbeing, awareness of strategies to enhance sensory wellbeing, and confidence in managing sensory wellbeing increased after the workshops with positive qualitative feedback from participants. The feedback questionnaires highlighted that patients found the sessions useful and were able to use some of the skills and strategies they learned in the workshop. This pilot work on sensory wellbeing workshops with a\u00a0protocol-based format was feasible and beneficial for the patient group. Preliminary evidence suggests that delivery of similar workshops could be sensible in addition to treatment as usual in inpatient and day-care programmes.",

Prelacteal feeds was given to 65 (33.5%) newborns and this was seen more among home deliveries ( P =0.018). Demand feeding was practiced by 169 (87.1%) mothers. Exclusive breast feeding (EBF) for 6 months was practiced by 81 (41.7%) mothers. Bottle feeding was seen in 7 (3.6%) cases. Weight gain during infancy was found to be maximum when infants were EBF for 6 months ( P <0.001) and weaned with semi-solid and solid diet alone in the following 6 months ( P =0.002). Gain in all anthropometric measurements was more in the initial 6 months of infancy compared to latter. Four (2.1%) infants were malnourished. Oil massage before bath was practiced by 189 (97.4%) mothers. Over 50% mothers practiced oil application to eyes or ears of infants.

Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the mediating role of self-compassion in the relationship between positive reactivity, negative reactivity, and perfectionism with disordered eating. The study method was descriptive-correlational through structural equation modeling (SEM). The present study population included all students of the University of Tehran in the city of Tehran in 2018\u20132019. A total of 302 students were selected by convenience sampling method and completed questionnaires on eating attitudes test-8, self-compassion scale (short form), eating disorder inventory-perfectionism scale, and Perth emotional reactivity scale. The SEM path analysis and Pearson correlation coefficient were conducted to analyze the obtained data in SPSS-23 and Lisrel-8.80. The finding of the path analysis showed that self-compassion acts as a mediating role in the relationship of disordered eating with positive and negative emotional reactivity and perfectionism. Only the direct effect coefficient of general positive reactivity on disordered eating was not significant. Based on the results of this study, self-compassion can serve as a protective factor against negative emotional reactivity and perfectionism. Therefore, self-compassion can be considered in the development of prevention and treatment programs for disordered eating.",

The second objective was to analyze the associations between length of hospital stay and time to achieve full enteral feeding with mode of delivery, birth weight and surgical procedure. The medical records of newborns with gastroschisis treated between 1997 and 2007 were reviewed. Two groups were considered: those delivered before 37 weeks (group A) and those delivered after 37 weeks (group B). The variables of gestational age, mode of delivery, birth weight, time to achieve full enteral feeding, length of hospital stay and surgical approach were analyzed and compared between groups. Forty-one patients were studied. In Group A, there were 14 patients with a mean birth weight (BW) of 2300 g (range=1680\u20133000) and a mean gestational age (GA) of 36 weeks (range=34\u201336). In group B, there were 24 patients with a mean BW of 2700 g (range=1500\u20133550) and a mean GA of 38 weeks (range=37\u201339). The mean time to achieve full enteral feeding was 30.1\u00b16.7 days in group A and 17.0\u00b12.5 days in group B (p=0.09) with an OR of 0.82 and a 95% CI of 0.20\u20133.23 after adjustment for sepsis and BW.

Multimethod, qualitative study; questionnaire, focus groups and interviews. Northern and Southern Tasmania, Australia. 127 mothers of childbearing age from a broad sociodemographic context completed a questionnaire and participated in 22 focus groups or 19 interviews across Tasmania, 2011\u20132013. Mothers view breastfeeding as \u2018natural\u2019 and \u2018best\u2019 and formula milk as \u2018wrong\u2019 and \u2018unnatural\u2019. In an effort to avoid formula and prolong exclusive breastfeeding, mothers will endure multiple issues (eg, pain, low milk supply, mastitis, public shaming) and make use of various forms of social and physical capital; resources such as father/partner support, expressing breast milk, bottles and dummies. The cessation of exclusive breastfeeding was frequently experienced as unexpected and \u2018devastating\u2019, leaving mothers with \u2018breastfeeding grief\u2019 (a prolonged sense of loss and failure). For many mothers, the cessation of exclusive breastfeeding results in lingering feelings of grief and failure making it harmful to women\u2019s emotional well-being. Reframing breastfeeding as a family practice where fathers/partners are incorporated as breastfeeding partners has the potential to help women negotiate and prolong breastfeeding. Proactive counselling and debriefing are needed to assist women who are managing feelings of \u2018breastfeeding grief\u2019.",

The current study contributes to a growing body of research that examines whether the purported benefits of breastfeeding are causal. We systematically evaluated the role of an expectant mother\u2019s prenatal breastfeeding intentions, which reflect not only demographic characteristics, but also knowledge, attitudes, and social norms about infant feeding, and therefore serve as a proxy for positive maternal selection into breastfeeding. We used the Infant Feeding Practices Study (IFPS) II (n = 1008) to examine a heretofore overlooked group of mothers\u2014those who intended to breastfeed but did not actually breastfeed. Results suggest that mothers who intended to breastfeed had infants with fewer ear infections and respiratory syncytial viruses, and used fewer antibiotics in the first year of life compared to infants whose mothers did not intend to breastfeed, irrespective of whether they actually breastfed. Because breastfeeding intention is a confounding characteristic that proxies for positive maternal selection and does not represent a causal mechanism for infant health, we further examined how mothers who intended to breastfeed differed from mothers who did not intend to breastfeed. Results suggest that mothers who intended to breastfeed had more knowledge about potential food contaminants and consulted more sources of information about nutrition and diet than mothers who did not intend to breastfeed. Taken together, our results underscore the need for new policy interventions aimed at improving infant health. \u2022 Research on breastfeeding does not fully account for maternal selection. \u2022 Prenatal intention to breastfeed may proxy for positive maternal selection into breastfeeding. \u2022 Formula-fed infants had similar health outcomes as breastfed infants, if their mothers intended to breastfeed. \u2022 Intending and non-intending mothers have differences in health knowledge prior to giving birth. \u2022 Future work should focus on maternal disadvantage between intending and non-intending mothers to improve infant health.

    "abstract": "Human milk (HM) lipid content is highly variable, and infants consume different volumes of milk. This makes precise sampling and calculation of the infant lipid intake problematic. In order to describe inaccuracies of estimates of lipid content introduced by various sampling protocols, we compared the true infant lipid intake with estimated intakes using different milk sampling protocols. Monthly milk samples ( n =\u00a01026) from months 1 to 6 of lactation were collected from 20 healthy, exclusively breastfeeding women. Infant lipid intake was measured by 24-hour test-weighing at month 3. Total lipid content was measured by creamatocrit. Concentrations and infant lipid intakes were calculated using 11 sampling protocols, using either the true milk intake or an average of 800\u00a0mL/d. These estimates were compared with the true infant lipid intake using repeated-measures ANOVA and linear mixed modeling with multiple comparisons. The mean maternal age was 32.0 years (SD \u00b1\u00a03.10), and infants were born term (40.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.1\u00a0weeks) with a mean birth weight of 3.87 kg (SD \u00b1\u00a00.39).\u00a0The mean true infant lipid intake was 28.6 g/d\u00a0(SD \u00b1\u00a09.8).\u00a0The mean estimated lipid intake using 1 morning pre-feed sample underestimated intake by >8.0\u00a0g/d. Estimates of infant lipid intake using other sampling protocols and an assumed intake volume of 800\u00a0mL/d also resulted in a wide range of differences (0.8\u201318.1\u00a0g/d) from the true intake. Use of 6 daily pre- and post-feed milk samples had a mean difference of only 0.1\u00a0g/d (95% CI, \u22122.9 to 2.7) from the true intake. A sampling protocol with 6 pre- and post-feed samples provides the most accurate estimate of lipid intake if it is not possible to perform 24-hour test weights. The potential inaccuracies of sampling protocols should be taken into consideration in the interpretation and translation of infant lipid intake results.",

A total of five feeding frequency groups were set up in three replicates as follows: one meal in a day at 08:00 hour, two meals a day at 08:00 and 17:00 hours, three meals a day at 08:00, 14:00, and 20:00 hours, four meals a day at 08:00, 12:00, 16:00, and 20:00 hours, and one meal every 2 days at 08:00 hour. Fish were fed at the rate of 1.2% body weight (BW)/d at 15\u00b0C and 1.5% BW/d at 19\u00b0C. At the end of 8 wks of feeding trial weight gain and specific growth rate were significantly higher at the fish fed groups of one meal a day and two meals a day at 15\u00b0C and fish fed groups of 1 meal every 2 days at 19\u00b0C were significantly lower than those of all other fish fed groups.

This study aimed to compare the nutritional status of children with autism with that of typically developing children (aged 4\u20136 years) in China. Nutritional status was assessed by means of nutritional data, anthropometric data, biochemical assessment, physical examination for nutrient deficiencies and providing a questionnaire to parents. A total of fifty-three children with autism and fifty-three typically developing children were enrolled in this study. The parents were asked to complete the questionnaire regarding the eating behaviour and gastrointestinal symptoms of their children. They were also asked to provide a 3 d food diary. Children with autism exhibited several abnormalities in terms of eating behaviour and gastrointestinal symptoms. The levels of vitamins A and B 6 , Zn and Ca intakes were <80 % of the dietary reference intakes in both groups. In addition, the proportions of vitamin C and Ca intake deficiencies in the autism group were significantly higher than those in the control group. Serum Zn level was less than the normal reference range in both the groups. Serum Ca, vitamin A and folate levels in children with autism were significantly lower when compared with children without autism. According to the anthropometric data, the mean BMI, weight-for-height Z -score ( Z WH ) and BMI for age Z -score ( Z BMIA ) of children with autism were significantly higher than those of the typically developing children. Thus, nutritional inadequacies were observed in children with autism and typically developing children in China, which were, however, more pronounced among children with autism.",

However, the role of white matter (WM) in AN patients has rarely been investigated. The present study aimed to assess alterations in WM microstructure of the entire brain in females with AN using a voxel-based method on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data. The study enrolled 8 female patients with AN and 14 age-matched females as controls (CW). The DTI data was collected from each subject to calculate the fractional anisotropy (FA) maps of the whole brain by the DTI-Studio software. Subsequently, a 2-sample t -test ( P <0.05, corrected) was performed to detect the difference in FA maps of AN and CW group, and a Pearson\u2019s correlation analyzed the relationship between mean FA value of brain regions and body mass index (BMI). Compared with CW, AN patients revealed a significant decrease in FA maps in the left superior frontal gyrus, medial frontal gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex, middle frontal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, thalamus, and bilateral insula. Moreover, significantly positive correlations were established between the mean FA value of the left inferior frontal gyrus, insula as well as thalamus and BMI in AN patients. Our findings supported the presence of WM abnormality in patients with AN. The significant differences of FA maps, in patients with AN, were associated with their aberrant BMI. The results further improved our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying AN.",

    "abstract": "Feeding behavior is regulated by a complex interplay of many endogenous substances, such as peptides and neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. Histamine is a neurotransmitter which expresses an anorectic effect on food intake via histamine H 1 receptors. The histaminergic system exists downstream of leptin, a satiety factor secreted from white adipose tissue. Because direct stimulation of the histaminergic system by histamine H 3 -inverse agonists or antagonists can normalize the obese phenotype in which animal models with exogenous leptin resistance, which resembles human obesity, the potential roles of histamine H 3 receptors as a therapeutic target now draw attention. Histaminergic activity is enhanced during feeding, and an oral somatic sensation is thought to affect histaminergic activity while blood glucose levels do not. In addition, gustatory information can modulate histaminergic activity by two mechanisms: by physiological excitation of the chorda tympani nerve, one of the taste nerves and by emotions elicited by taste perception, i.e., taste palatability. Particularly, aversive and hazardous taste stimuli tonically facilitate histaminergic activity, suggesting that the histaminergic system is involved in the response to harmful stimuli. Together with recent findings, it is postulated that the histaminergic system responds to both mechanical and chemical sensory input from the oral cavity during feeding and is exerted as a part of the danger response system.",

    "abstract": "Open defecation and poor fecal management facilitates the spread of disease. Viscous heating can pasteurize fecal sludge by creating a high shear field in the annular gap between a stationary, cylindrical outer shell and a rotating inner core. As sludge flows axially through the annular gap, thorough mixing and frictional heating eliminate cool spots where microbes may survive. A viscous heater (VH) compares favorably to a conventional heat exchanger, where cool slugs may occur. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to determine the effects of geometry and fluid rheology on VH performance over a range of conditions. A shear-rate and temperature-dependent rheological model was developed from experimental data, using a sludge simulant. CFD of an existing VH used the model to improve the original na\u00efve design by including temperature and shear rate-dependent viscosity. CFD results were compared to experimental data at 132 and 200 L/hr to predict design and operating conditions for 1,000 L/hr. Subsequent experimentation with fecal sludge indicated that the CFD approach was valid for design and operation.",

One hundred and fourteen patients, in the age group of 20\u201360 years, admitted within 24 h of TBI with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 4\u20138 were enrolled for the study. Nineteen patients who had expired before the attainment of total enteral feeding were excluded from the analysis. Total enteral feeding was attained before 3 days, 4\u20137 days, and after 7 days in 12, 52, and 31 patients, respectively, depending on gastric tolerance. They were prospectively assessed for various markers of nutrition and outcome was assessed at 3 and 6 months. Prospective assessment of 67 hospitalized patients at 3 weeks revealed significant differences in anthropometric measurements, total protein, albumin levels, clinical features of malnutrition, and mortality among the three groups. 80% of those fed before 3 days had favorable outcome at 3 months compared to 43% among those fed later. The odds ratio (OR) was 5.29 (95% CI 1.03\u201327.03) and P value was 0.04. The difference between those fed before 3 days and 4\u20137 days was not significant at 6 months even though patients fed before 7 days had still significantly higher favorable outcome compared to those fed after 7 days (OR 7.69, P = 0.002). Multivariate analysis for unfavorable outcome showed significance of P = 0.03 for feeding after 3 days and P = 0.01 for feeding after 7 days. In severe TBI, unfavorable outcome was significantly associated with attainment of total enteral feeding after 3 days and more so after 7 days following injury.",

A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 307 rural mothers who have a youngest child aged 2 years or less. Mothers were selected using systematic random sampling. All the studied mothers knew that breastfeeding is the best nutritional source for the baby. The majority of the mothers had good knowledge about the advantages of breastfeeding for child. As regards weaning, majority (92.5%) of the mothers defined weaning as breastfeeding cessation. Most of the mothers (94.8%) agreed that breastfeeding protect child from infection, 96.1% agreed that it is the healthiest for infant, 76.5% agreed that breast milk lead to loss of figure, and 83.4% agreed that breastfeeding should be avoided during mother's illness. About 84% initiated breastfeeding immediately after delivery, and 42.7% of the studied mothers offered pre-lacteal feeds to baby before lactation. About thirty quarters (74.2%) of mothers fed colostrum. Exclusive breast-feeding was found to be associated with mother's education ( P < 0.0001) but not with mother's age at birth, mother's occupation, or place of birth. There is a need for health care system interventions, family interventions, and public health education campaigns to promote optimal BF practices, especially in less educated women.",

    "abstract": "Adolescence represents a pivotal stage in the development of positive or negative body image. Many influences exist during the teen years including transitions (eg, puberty) that affect one\u2019s body shape, weight status, and appearance. Weight status exists along a spectrum between being obese (ie, where one\u2019s body weight is in the 95th percentile for age and gender) to being underweight. Salient influences on body image include the media, which can target adolescents, and peers who help shape beliefs about the perceived body ideal. Internalization of and pressures to conform to these socially prescribed body ideals help to explain associations between weight status and body image. The concepts of fat talk and weight-related bullying during adolescence greatly contribute to an overemphasis on body weight and appearance as well as the development of negative body perceptions and dissatisfaction surrounding specific body parts. This article provides an overview of the significance of adolescent development in shaping body image, the relationship between body image and adolescent weight status, and the consequences of having a negative body image during adolescence (ie, disordered eating, eating disorders, and dysfunctional exercise). Practical implications for promoting a healthy weight status and positive body image among adolescents will be discussed. ",

Mango for export is subjected to hydrothermal treatment as a quarantine method for the control of this pest, but exposure to heat for long periods of time reduces considerably the quality and shelf-life of treated fruit. The aim of this work was to study morphological changes of third-instar larvae and adults of A. ludens after in\u00a0vitro exposure to high temperature at sublethal times. A heating block system was used to expose larvae at 46.1\u00b0C for 19.6 and 12.9\u2009min, producing 94.6 and 70% mortality, respectively. Treated larvae were processed for optical microscopy. A fraction of surviving treated larvae was separated into containers with artificial diet to allow development into adults. Adult sexual organs were dissected and processed for transmission electron microscopy analysis. Results showed that 94.6% of the treated larvae died at 46.1\u00b0C for 19.6\u2009min and none of the surviving larvae eclosed to adulthood, as they developed as malformed puparia. For the in\u00a0vitro treatment at 46.1\u00b0C during 12.9\u2009min, 70% of the treated larvae died and only 3.75% reached the adult stage, but ultrastructural damage in the male testes and in the female ovaries was observed. Additionally, 11.1% of the adult flies from the in\u00a0vitro treatment also showed wing malformation and were incapable of flying.

A major challenge with engaging men in health promotion is the perception that attention to one\u2019s health runs counter to masculine identities. Contemporary health promotion programs are believed to hold little \u201cmanly\u201d appeal and often fail to engage and retain men. The HAT TRICK program was designed to engage men with their health by delivering an intervention in collaboration with a semi-professional ice hockey team. The program included 12 weekly sessions promoting healthy eating, active living, and social connectedness among men. Gender-sensitized elements were reflected in the program design, setting, content, and delivery. Semistructured telephone interviews were conducted with 23 men to explore perspectives of their participation in the gender-sensitized intervention. Participants were white (100%) with a mean age of 53 years ( SD \u00b1 9.9), Body Mass Index (BMI) of 37 kg/m 2 ( SD \u00b1 6.8), and waist circumference of 127 centimeters ( SD \u00b1 14.5).

    "abstract": "Neuropeptide Y (NPY), colocalized with norepinephrine neuron, is known to modulate sympathetic activity and feeding behavior. Although experimental type 1 diabetes has increased sympathetic activity at the early part of the disease process, little effort was made so far to understand the correlation between NPY level in the hypothalamus and sympathetic activity in diabetes. Male Sprague Dawley rats were made diabetic by a single injection of streptozotocin (65 mg/kg body weight, IV). The animals were then studied after 2, 4, and 8 weeks. Control animals received only citrate vehicle. In an effort to clarify the modulatory effect of NPY at the early stage of diabetes, the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of hypothalamus was sampled by microdialysis for NPY and norepinephrine level. While NPY level was increased immediately within 2 weeks (along with feeding behavior), norepinephrine level was increased only after 8 weeks following injection of streptozotocin. The animals lost significant weight. These results are interpreted to mean that a strong correlation exists between the feeding behavior and NPY level in PVN. Since NPY is known to inhibit sympathetic activity it is possible that NPY receptors are down-regulated following diabetes. The higher level of norepinephrine indicating higher sympathetic activity did not allow the animals to gain weight. In addition, controversy exists regarding pleiotropic activities of NPY related to the feeding behavior of these animals.",

    "abstract": "The edible dormouse is a specialized seed predator which is highly adapted to the fluctuations of food availability caused by mast seeding of beech and oak trees. Dormice produce young just in time with maximum food availability, and can completely skip reproduction in years with a lack of seeding. Because their decision to reproduce or not in any particular year is made long before the ripe seeds are available, it seems that dormice can anticipate the upcoming mast situation. We tested the hypothesis that the presence of high caloric food in spring affects their reproductive decision. Therefore, we supplementary fed dormice in a field experiment from spring to early summer with sunflower seeds, which also contain a high amount of energy. Supplemental feeding caused significant increases in the proportion of reproducing females and reproductively active males. These results suggest that edible dormice may use the occurrence of an energy rich food resource to predict the autumnal mast situation. Further, our data indicate that the decision to reproduce was not the result of an increased body mass due to the consumption of surplus food, but that sufficient seed abundance acts as an environmental signal to which dormice adjust their reproduction.",

    "abstract": "Stimulation of lateral hypothalamic (LH) neurons produces eating in sated animals and increases activity of dopamine neurons. The present study shows that the activation of dopamine neurons failed to induce eating. Rather, food approach and eating were observed via activation of LH fibers that project through the VTA, continuing caudally and terminating in a brainstem region medial to the locus coeruleus (LC). We found that activation of GABA neurons in this peri-LC region is both necessary and sufficient for LH stimulation-induced eating, whereas their role in normal homeostatic feeding appears negligible. These findings suggest that this circuit orchestrates just one of the multiple aspects of eating: a compulsive consumption of food in the absence of a physiological stimulus of hunger. Electrical or optogenetic stimulation of lateral hypothalamic (LH) GABA neurons induces rapid vigorous eating in sated animals. The dopamine system has been implicated in the regulation of feeding. Previous work has suggested that a subset of LH GABA neurons projects to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and targets GABA neurons, inhibiting them and thereby disinhibiting dopaminergic activity and release. Furthermore, stimulation-induced eating is attenuated by dopamine lesions or receptor antagonists. Here we explored the involvement of dopamine in LH stimulation-induced eating. LH stimulation caused sated mice to pick up pellets of standard chow with latencies that varied based on stimulation intensity; once food was picked up, animals ate for the remainder of the 60-s stimulation period. However, lesion of VTA GABA neurons failed to disrupt this effect. Moreover, direct stimulation of VTA or substantia nigra dopamine cell bodies failed to induce food approach or eating. Looking further, we found that some LH GABA fibers pass through the VTA to more caudal sites, where they synapse onto neurons near the locus coeruleus (LC). Similar eating was induced by stimulation of LH GABA terminals or GABA cell bodies in this peri-LC region. Lesion of peri-LC GABA neurons blocked LH stimulation-induced eating, establishing them as a critical downstream circuit element for LH neurons. Surprisingly, lesions did not alter body weight, suggesting that this system is not involved in the hunger or satiety mechanisms that govern normal feeding. Thus, we present a characterization of brain circuitry that may promote overeating and contribute to obesity.",

    "abstract": "Studies have reported that impulsivity predicts childhood BMI and that the association is mediated by eating behaviors. One aspect of impulsivity \u2013 potentially crucial in the obesity context \u2013 is reward responsiveness, which may predispose to responsiveness to palatable food cues. The behavioral susceptibility theory hypothesizes that genetic susceptibility to obesity operates partly via genetically determined differences in appetite regulation. Reward responsiveness may therefore be one of the neuro-endophenotypes that mediates genetic susceptibility to obesity. To test whether reward responsiveness, eating behaviors and child BMI share common genetic architecture. We examined reward responsiveness, eating behaviors and BMI in five-year-old children from Gemini, a UK birth cohort of 2,402 twin pairs born in 2007. All measures were collected by parent report. Reward responsiveness was derived from the Behavioral Approach System. Compulsion to eat and eating for pleasure was measured with the \u2018food responsiveness\u2019 scale of the Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire. Wanting to eat in response to environmental food cues was measured with the \u2018external eating\u2019 scale of the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire. Maximum-likelihood structural equation modelling was used to establish underlying common genetic and environmental influences. There were significant positive phenotypic correlations between all traits except for reward responsiveness and BMI. Genetic factors explained the majority of the association between food responsiveness and external eating (74%, 95%CI: 61, 87), whereas common shared environmental factors explained the majority of the associations between reward responsiveness with both food responsiveness (55%, 95%CI: 20, 90) and external eating (70%, 95%CI: 39, 100). Our study demonstrates the importance of common environmental factors in the shared etiology between reward responsiveness and childhood eating behaviors. However, the common etiology underlying both reward responsiveness and BMI is unclear, as there was no phenotypic correlation between reward responsiveness and BMI at this age. Further longitudinal research needs to detangle this complex relationship throughout development.",

Bone mineral density results for the femur neck and lumbar spine were classified into 3 groups according to WHO criteria as normal ( T score > \u20131.0 SD), osteopenia ( T score \u20131.0 to \u20132.5 SD), and osteoporosis ( T score < \u20132.5 SD). Patients with osteopenia or osteoporosis ( T score < \u20131.0 SD) were considered as having low bone mass (LBM).

Significant differences were found between femur BMD and spine BMD of groups in one-way ANOVA analysis ( p = 0.025, p = 0.005, respectively). Additionally, when compared with the other three groups, group 4 was older and had longer duration of menopause ( p < 0.01). In logistic regression analysis, age and body mass index were found as independent risk factors of LBM [odds ratio: 1.084 (95% CI 1.031-1.141); odds ratio: 0.896 (95% CI 0.859-0.935)], while duration of lactation was not found as an independent predictor of LBM. In this study, we have found that changes of bone metabolism during lactation had no effect on postmenopausal BMD measured by DXA. Consequently, it can be suggested that long breast-feeding duration is not a risk factor for low bone mass later in life.",

    "abstract": "To examine the relationship between specific reasons for stopping breastfeeding and depressive symptoms in the postnatal period. Difficulty breastfeeding has been connected to postnatal depression although it is unclear whether difficulty breastfeeding precedes or succeeds a diagnosis. However, the concept of \u2018breastfeeding difficulty\u2019 is wide and includes biological, psychological and social factors. A cross\u2010sectional self\u2010report survey. Data were collected between December 2012 and February 2013. 217 women with an infant aged 0\u20106\u00a0months who had started breastfeeding at birth but had stopped before 6\u00a0months old completed a questionnaire examining breastfeeding duration and reasons for stopping breastfeeding. They further completed a copy of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. A short breastfeeding duration and multiple reasons for stopping breastfeeding were associated with higher depression score. However, in a regression analysis only the specific reasons of stopping breastfeeding for physical difficulty and pain remained predictive of depression score. Understanding women's specific reasons for stopping breastfeeding rather than breastfeeding duration is critical in understanding women's breastfeeding experience and providing women with emotional support. Issues with pain and physical breastfeeding were most indicative of postnatal depression in comparison to psychosocial reasons highlighting the importance of spending time with new mothers to help them with issues such as latch.",

    "abstract": "The objective of this study was to assess the rate of non-exclusive breastfeeding and associated factors among Thai women under the Breastfeeding Promotion Program. This was a prospective descriptive study that involved term postpartum women who attended the Breastfeeding Clinic at Srinagarind Hospital in Thailand, from April to December 2016. Abstracted data included baseline characteristics, obstetric history, breastfeeding history, problems in breastfeeding at day 3 and 2 weeks, and feeding status at 12 weeks postpartum. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression methods were used to determine significant factors predicting non-exclusive breastfeeding. Of the 500 postpartum women enrolled in this study, follow-up data at 12 weeks postpartum were available for 368 women (73.6%). The rate of non-exclusive breastfeeding assessed at 12 weeks postpartum was 26.4% (95% CI 21.9%\u201331.2%). Nipple problems and pain during the first 3 days postpartum and milk storage problems at 2 weeks postpartum were the major reasons for non-exclusive breastfeeding (69.4% and 59.1%, respectively). The significant independent factors that predicted these included patients not having confidence in their ability to breastfeed exclusively or not having any intention to do so (OR 7.22; 95% CI 3.26\u201314.24), no rooming-in (OR 2.31; 95% CI 1.04\u20135.12), and low milk quantity at 2 weeks postpartum (OR 3.75; 95% CI 1.70\u20138.29). The rate of non-exclusive breastfeeding in this study was ~26%, and significant associated factors included having lack of confidence/intention, no rooming-in, and low milk quantity reported at 2 weeks postpartum.",

This quasi-experimental study was conducted in 2015 on 210 nulliparous women in Shushtar (Iran). The participants were randomly allocated into intervention and control groups. The study tool was the short form of breastfeeding self-efficacy scale that was completed on arrival of the study (days 3\u20135), at the end of week four and at the end of week eight. Data were analyzed by SPSS 19, using Chi-square, ANOVA, and repeated measurements. Mean age of participants was 24.52 years old with standard deviation of 95.4. Mean score of breastfeeding self-efficacy in gain-framed group at days 3\u20135, week four and week eight was 47.94, 57.43 and 52.8 respectively; in loss-framed group it was 47.76, 56.11 and 52.64 respectively; and in control group it was 45.16, 48.68 and 45.31 respectively. No significant difference was observed between the score of average self-efficacy of days 3\u20135 and week eight in control group (p=0.93). However, in gain-framed group (p=0.001) and loss-framed group (p=0.004), a significant difference was observed.

Across position types (permanent, 52.7%; temporary, 47.3%), participants reported high concern about data collection, recruitment, and securing future funding. Those holding temporary positions reported significantly greater concern about COVID\u201019's impact on their career and greater stress than participants in permanent positions. Strategies for dealing with research disruptions included: employing technology; reprioritizing goals/tasks; and encouraging collaboration. Results underscore the high levels of stress and disruption caused by COVID\u201019.

Upon bolting and thereby development of the inflorescence and initiation of seed setting, the spatial distribution of glucosinolates does undergo major changes. Here we investigate the role of GTR1 and GTR2 in establishment of glucosinolate source-sink relationships in bolting plants. By in vivo feeding the exogenous p -hydroxybenzylglucosinolate to a rosette leaf or the roots of wildtype and a gtr1 gtr2 mutant, we show that this glucosinolate can specifically translocate from the rosette and the roots to the inflorescence in a GTR1- and GTR2-dependent manner. This marks that, upon bolting, the inflorescence rather than the roots constitute the strongest sink for leaf glucosinolates compared with plants in vegetative state.",

This study was done to assess the effect of BF on consumption of propofol, sevoflurane and haemodynamic stability in women. Study was conducted on 120 women aged 20\u201330 years of American Society of Anesthesiologists I and II physical status scheduled for tubectomy under general anaesthesia who were randomly allocated to three groups 40 of each; BF, withhold feeding (WF), and non-feeding (NF) groups. All received standard premedication. Heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and state entropy (SE) values were recorded at regular intervals. All patients were induced with intravenous propofol until the SE levels dropped to 45, and dose of propofol recorded. Airway was secured with laryngeal mask airway and anaesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane in 60% N 2 O and O 2 . Sevoflurane concentration was adjusted to maintain SE between 40 and 60. End tidal concentration of sevoflurane and consumption of sevoflurane (ml) was recorded by GE Datex-Ohmeda S/5\u2122 System. Results were analysed by analysis of variance and Chi-square test. Demographic parameters were comparable. Dose of propofol and sevoflurane consumption in group BF was significantly reduced by 20% and 35%, respectively ( P < 0.05) compared to group NF. Intra-operative HR and MAP were persistently low in group BF and elevated in group WF ( P < 0.05). BF before induction of anaesthesia decreases the consumption of propofol, sevoflurane and maintains the intra-operative haemodynamic stability, whereas withholding BF increases propofol and sevoflurane consumption with intra-operative higher HR and MAP, compared to control group.",

However, little is known about the current status of breastfeeding practice, as well as the trends in breastfeeding practices during recent years. We examined global prevalence of the World Health Organization (WHO) feeding practices in 57 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and time trends since 2000 for 44 selected countries. We included 57 eligible LMICs that had completed data on breastfeeding and complementary feeding in 2010\u20132018 from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) for examining current feeding status. We further selected 44 LMICs that had two standard DHS surveys between 2000 and 2009 and 2010\u20132018 to examine time trends of feeding status. We calculated global, regional, and national weighted prevalence estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for five breastfeeding indicators and two complementary feeding indicators. In 57 LMICs during 2010\u20132018, global weighted prevalence was 51.9% for early initiation of breastfeeding, 45.7% for exclusive breastfeeding under 6 months, 32.0% for exclusive breastfeeding at 4\u20135 months, 83.1% for continued breastfeeding at 1 year, 56.2% for continued breastfeeding at 2 years, 14.9% for introduction of solid, semi-solid or soft foods under 6 months, and 63.1% for introduction of solid, semi-solid or soft foods at 6\u20138 months. Eastern Mediterranean (34.5%) and European regions (43.7%) (vs. South-East Asia/Western Pacific (55.2%)), and upper middle-income countries (38.4%) (vs. lower middle-income countries (47.4%)) had poorer performance of exclusive breastfeeding under 6 months. South-East Asia/Western Pacific regions (51.0%) (vs. other regions (68.3%-84.1%)) and low-income (66.4%) or lower middle-income countries (58.2%) (vs. upper middle-income countries (81.7%)) had lower prevalence of introduction of solid, semi-solid or soft foods at 6\u20138 months. In 44 selected LMICs from 2000 to 2009 to 2010\u20132018, total weighted prevalence presented an increase of 10.1% for exclusive breastfeeding under 6 months, but a 1.7% decrease for continued breastfeeding at 1 year. Over this period, the Eastern Mediterranean region had a 5.3% decrease of exclusive breastfeeding under 6 months, and the European region had a 2.0% increase for introduction of solid, semi-solid or soft foods under 6 months. The prevalence of introduction of solid, semi-solid or soft foods at 6\u20138 months decreased in South-East Asia/Western Pacific region by 15.2%, and in lower middle-income countries by 24.4%. Breastfeeding practices in LMICs have continued to improve in the past decade globally, but practices still lag behind the WHO feeding recommendations. Breastfeeding practices differed greatly across WHO regions, with the Eastern Mediterranean and European regions, and upper middle-income countries facing the greatest challenges in meeting targets. Continued efforts are needed to achieve the 2025 global breastfeeding target.",

    "abstract": "A better understanding of the factors involved in health and wellness among college students can aid in the design of interventions that can reduce the rate of weight gain during young adulthood. The aim of this study was to determine the gender differences in weight status, dietary habits, and health attitudes in a sample of college students at Kuwait University (KU). In this cross-sectional study, 615 students were recruited from KU between November 2013 and March 2014. Components of the study included a self-report questionnaire, assessment of body mass index, and calculation of Healthy Eating Score (HES) to assess eating habits and attitudes. Statistical analyses were performed to assess the gender differences among these domains. The findings revealed that a greater proportion of men were overweight and obese compared to women (28.7% and 23.8% vs. 19.9% and 12.1%, respectively). Both genders show equally unhealthy dietary habits, marked by low mean HES scores. Gender-specific dietary patterns were noted, with more men reporting eating >6 oz (168 g) of animal protein per day as compared to women (48.4% vs. 28.9%, p < 0.001). A higher proportion of female students reported regular consumption of potato chips and fatty salty snacks (51.3% and 40.4%, respectively, p = 0.12) and that they ate sweets more than twice a day (52.5% and 39.9%, respectively, p = 0.041). Our findings highlight the need for evidence-based gender-specific strategies to reduce the number of overweight and obese college students and promote healthy dietary habits and eating attitudes among this population.",

Data analysis was performed using descriptive (frequency, mean), independent samples t -test, Student's t -test, t 2 -test, and Chi-square test. All values of P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. There was no significant differences between the intervention and control groups with regard to age ( P = 0.086) and gestational age ( P = 0.741). The breastfeeding self-efficacy scores were higher in the intervention group (63.66 \u00b1 6.11) than in the control group (57.04 \u00b1 6.18) after 1 month of childbirth ( P = 0.001).

    "abstract": "About half of all cancer patients show a syndrome of cachexia, characterized by anorexia and loss of adipose tissue and skeletal muscle mass. Cachexia can have a profound impact on quality of life, symptom burden, and a patient\u2019s sense of dignity. It is a very serious complication, as weight loss during cancer treatment is associated with more chemotherapy-related side effects, fewer completed cycles of chemotherapy, and decreased survival rates. Numerous cytokines have been postulated to play a role in the etiology of cancer cachexia. Cytokines can elicit effects that mimic leptin signaling and suppress orexigenic ghrelin and neuropeptide Y (NPY) signaling, inducing sustained anorexia and cachexia not accompanied by the usual compensatory response. Furthermore, cytokines have been implicated in the induction of cancer-related muscle wasting. Cytokine-induced skeletal muscle wasting is probably a multifactorial process, which involves a protein synthesis inhibition, an increase in protein degradation, or a combination of both. The best treatment of the cachectic syndrome is a multifactorial approach. Many drugs including appetite stimulants, thalidomide, cytokine inhibitors, steroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, branched-chain amino acids, eicosapentaenoic acid, and antiserotoninergic drugs have been proposed and used in clinical trials, while others are still under investigation using experimental animals. There is a growing awareness of the positive impact of supportive care measures and development of promising novel pharmaceutical agents for cachexia. While there has been great progress in understanding the underlying biological mechanisms of cachexia, health care providers must also recognize the psychosocial and biomedical impact cachexia can have.",

    "abstract": "Although high-efficiency targeted delivery is investigated for years, the efficiency of tumor targeting seems still a hard core to smash. To overcome this problem, we design a three-step delivery strategy based on streptavidin\u2013biotin interaction with the help of c(RGDfK), magnetic fields and lasers. The ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (USIONPs) modified with c(RGDfK) and biotin are delivered at step 1, followed by streptavidin and the doxorubicin (Dox) loaded nanosystems conjugated with biotin at steps 2 and 3, respectively. The delivery systems were proved to be efficient on A549\u00a0cells. The co-localization of signal for each step revealed the targeting mechanism. The external magnetic field could further amplify the endocytosis of USPIONs based on c(RGDfK), and magnify the uptake distinctions among different test groups. Based on photoacoustic imaging, laser-heating treatment could enhance the permeability of tumor venous blood vessels and change the insufficient blood flow in cancer. Then, it was noticed in\u00a0vivo that only three-step delivery with laser-heating and magnetic fields realized the highest tumor distribution of nanosystem. Finally, the magnetism/laser-auxiliary cascaded delivery exhibited the best antitumor efficacy. Generally, this study demonstrated the necessity of combining physical, biological and chemical means of targeting. A new three-step strategy in magnetism/laser-auxiliary is illustrated. Firstly, the tumor is irradiated by 808\u00a0nm laser. Then, USPIONs modified with c(RGDfK)/biotin are injected and magnetic field is applied to the tumor, followed by injection of streptavidin and lipid nanosystems loaded Dox, modified with biotin.

Animals were then randomly assigned to the following groups ( n =\u00a08\u201310/group): 1 ) HF ad libitum; 2 ) purified high-fiber diet (Daniel Fast, DF); 3 ) HF\u2013time-restricted feeding (TRF) (6 h); 4 ) HF\u2013alternate-day fasting (ADF); or 5 ) HF at 80% total caloric restriction (CR). After 8 wk, obesity and gut parameters were characterized. We also examined changes to the gut microbiome and mycobiome before, during, and following dietary interventions. Body mass gain was reduced with all restricted dietary groups. HF-fed microbiota displayed lower \u03b1-diversity along with reduced phylum levels of Bacteroidetes and increased Firmicutes . Animals switched from HF to DF demonstrated a rapid transition in bacterial taxonomic composition, \u03b1-, and \u03b2-diversity that initially resembled HF, but was distinct after 4 and 8 wk of DF feeding. Time-or calorie-restricted HF-fed groups did not show changes at the phylum level, but \u03b1-diversity was increased, with specific genera altered. Six weeks of HF feeding reduced various fungal populations, particularly Alternaria , Aspergillus , Cladosporium , and Talaromyces , and increased Candida , Hanseniaspora , and Kurtzmaniella . However, 8 wk of intervention did not change the fungal populations, with the most abundant genera being Candida , Penicillium , and Hanseniaspora . These data suggest that timed-feeding protocols and diet composition do not significantly affect the gut fungal community, despite inducing measurable shifts in the bacterial population that coincide with improvements in metabolism.",

    "abstract": "The Canada Prenatal Nutrition Program (CPNP) provides a variety of health and nutrition supports to vulnerable mothers and strongly promotes breastfeeding but does not have a formal framework for postnatal lactation support. Breastfeeding duration and exclusivity rates in Canada fall well below global recommendations, particularly among socially and economically vulnerable women. We aimed to explore CPNP participant experiences with breastfeeding and with a novel community lactation support program in Toronto, Canada that included access to certified lactation consultants and an electric breast pump, if needed. Four semistructured focus groups and 21 individual interviews ( n = 46 women) were conducted between September and December 2017. Data were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. Study participants reported a strong desire to breastfeed but a lack of preparation for breastfeeding\u2010associated challenges. Three main challenges were identified by study participants: physical (e.g., pain and low milk supply), practical (e.g., cost of breastfeeding support and maternal time pressures), and breastfeeding self\u2010efficacy (e.g., concern about milk supply and conflicting information). Mothers reported that the free lactation support helped to address breastfeeding challenges. In their view, the key element of success with the new program was the in\u2010home visit by the lactation consultant, who was highly skilled and provided care in a non\u2010judgmental manner. They reported this support would have been otherwise unavailable due to cost or travel logistics. This study suggests value in exploring the addition of postnatal lactation support to the well\u2010established national CPNP as a means to improve breastfeeding duration and exclusivity among vulnerable women.",

    "abstract": "To determine the effects of implementing an enteral feeding protocol on the nutritional delivery and outcomes of intensive care patients. An uncontrolled, observational before-and-after study was performed in a tertiary mixed medical-surgical intensive care unit (ICU). In 2013, a nurse-driven enteral feeding protocol was developed and implemented in the ICU. Nutrition and outcome-related data from patients who were treated in the study unit from 2011-2012 (the Before group) and 2014-2015 (the After group) were obtained from a local electronic database, the national Population Registry and the hospital\u2019s Infection Control Service. Data from adult patients, readmissions excluded, who were treated for at least 7 d in the study unit were analysed. In total, 231 patients were enrolled in the Before and 249 in the After group. The groups were comparable regarding demographics, patient profile, and severity of illness. Fewer patients were mechanically ventilated on admission in the After group (86.7% vs 93.1% in the Before group, P = 0.021). The prevalence of hospital-acquired infections, length of ICU stay and ICU, 30- and 60-d mortality did not differ between the groups. Patients in the After group had a lower 90-d ( P = 0.026) and 120-d ( P = 0.033) mortality. In the After group, enteral nutrition was prescribed less frequently ( P = 0.039) on day 1 but significantly more frequently on all days from day 3. Implementation of the feeding protocol resulted in a higher cumulative amount of enterally ( P = 0.049) and a lower cumulative amount of parenterally ( P < 0.001) provided calories by day 7, with an overall reduction in caloric provision ( P < 0.001). The prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms was comparable in both groups, as was the frequency of prokinetic use. Underfeeding (total calories < 80% of caloric needs, independent of route) was observed in 59.4% of the study days Before vs 76.9% After ( P < 0.001). Inclusion in the Before group, previous abdominal surgery, intra-abdominal hypertension and the sum of gastrointestinal symptoms were found to be independent predictors of insufficient enteral nutrition. The use of a nurse-driven feeding protocol improves the delivery of enteral nutrition in ICU patients without concomitant increases in gastrointestinal symptoms or intra-abdominal hypertension.",

This is a cross-sectional study with 34,366 children and using data from the database of the 2 nd Nationwide Survey of Breastfeeding Prevalence performed in the Brazilian capitals and Federal District in 2008. Cluster sampling was used. The questionnaire included questions about the use of artificial nipples in the last 24 hours. The analysis considered three outcomes: exclusive use of pacifier, exclusive use of bottle feeding, and use of artificial nipples (pacifier and bottle feeding). Prevalence ratios were obtained using Poisson regression with robust variance following a hierarchical model. The following factors were associated with exclusive use of the pacifier: mother working outside the home, primiparity, child was not breastfed within the first hour, and child had consumed tea on the first day at home. The following factors were associated with exclusive use of bottle feeding: mother working outside the home, primiparity, low birth weight, child not breastfed within the first hour, and child had consumed milk formula and tea on the first day at home. The following factors were associated with use of artificial nipples (pacifier and bottle feeding): mother working outside the home, primiparity, cesarean delivery, the male gender, low birth weight, born in a hospital not accredited as \u201cbaby friendly\u201d, required health baby monitoring in the Primary Health Care Unit (PR = 0.91), and child had consumed milk formula, water, or tea on the first day at home.

    "abstract": "The goal of our study was to evaluate the effects of different medicinal herbs rich in polyphenol (Lemon balm, Sage, St. John's wort and Small-flowered Willowherb) used as dietary supplements on bioaccumulation of some essential metals (Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu) in different chicken meats (liver, legs and breast). In different type of chicken meats (liver, legs and breast) from chickens fed with diets enriched in minerals and medicinal herbs, beneficial metals (Fe, Mn, Zn and Cu) were analysed by flame atomic absorption spectrometry. Fe is the predominant metal in liver and Zn is the predominant metal in legs and breast chicken meats. The addition of metal salts in the feed influences the accumulations of all metals in the liver, legs and breast chicken meat with specific difference to the type of metal and meat. The greatest influences were observed in legs meat for Fe and Mn. Under the influence of polyphenol-rich medicinal herbs, accumulation of metals in the liver, legs and breast chicken meat presents specific differences for each medicinal herb, to the control group that received a diet supplemented with metal salts only. Great influence on all metal accumulation factors was observed in diet enriched with sage, which had significantly positive effect for all type of chicken meats. Under the influence of medicinal herbs rich in different type of polyphenol, accumulation of metals in the liver, legs and breast chicken meat presents significant differences from the group that received a diet supplemented only with metal salts. Each medicinal herb from diet had a specific influence on the accumulation of metals and generally moderate or poor correlations were observed between total phenols and accumulation of metals. This may be due to antagonism between metal ions and presence of other chelating agents (amino acids and protein) from feeding diets which can act as competitor for complexation of metals and influence accumulation of metals in chicken meat.

    "abstract": "One of the fundamental challenges in obesity research is to identify subjects prone to gain weight so that obesity and its comorbidities can be promptly prevented or treated. The principles of thermodynamics as applied to human body energetics demonstrate that susceptibility to weight gain varies among individuals as a result of inter-individual differences in energy expenditure and energy intake, two factors that counterbalance one another and that together determine daily energy balance and, ultimately, bodyweight change. This review focuses on the variability among individuals in human metabolism that determines weight change. Conflicting results have been reported about the role of inter-individual differences in energy metabolism during energy balance in relation to future weight change. However, recent studies show that metabolic responses to acute, short-term dietary interventions that create energy imbalance, such as low-protein overfeeding or fasting for 24 hours, may reveal the underlying metabolic phenotype that determines the degree of resistance to diet-induced weight loss or the propensity to spontaneous weight gain over time. Metabolically \u201cthrifty\u201d individuals, characterized by a predilection for saving energy in settings of undernutrition and dietary protein restriction, display a minimal increase in plasma Fibroblast Growth Factor 21 (FGF21) concentrations in response to a low-protein overfeeding diet and tend to gain more weight over time as compared to metabolically \u201cspendthrift\u201d individuals. Similarly, inter-individual variability in the causal relationship between energy expenditure and energy intake (\u201cenergy sensing\u201d) and in the metabolic response to cold exposure (e.g., brown adipose tissue activation) seems to some extent to be indicative of individual propensity to weight gain. Thus, an increased understanding and the clinical characterization of phenotypic differences in energy metabolism among individuals (metabolic profile) may lead to new strategies to prevent weight gain or improve weight loss interventions by targeted therapies on the basis of metabolic phenotype and susceptibility to obesity in individual persons.",

    "abstract": "Cesarean delivery is linked with lower rates of early breastfeeding initiation. This study aimed to determine the prevalence and associated factors of early initiation of breastfeeding among women admitted for elective cesarean delivery in Kelantan, Malaysia. A total of 171 women admitted for elective cesarean delivery at two tertiary hospitals in Kelantan, Malaysia, participated in this study. On day two after cesarean delivery, face-to-face interviews were conducted with the mothers to get information on feeding practice. Descriptive statistics, including simple and multiple logistic regressions, were used for data analysis. Seventy-three percent of mothers initiated breastfeeding within 1 hour of birth. Approximately 15.8% and 10.5% of mothers initiated breastfeeding within 24 hours and \u226524 hours, respectively. Skin-to-skin contact between mothers and their infants occurred in 77.8% of cases after cesarean delivery. Breastfeeding initiation was significantly associated with skin-to-skin contact (odds ratio [OR], 14.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.58\u201358.06), mothers who exclusively breastfed during hospitalization (OR, 36.37; 95% CI, 5.60\u2013236.24), and infants who were not sleepy during attempts at breastfeeding (OR, 5.17; 95% CI, 1.32\u201320.21). Based on our results, it is possible to increase the proportion of mothers initiating breastfeeding within 1 hour among women who undergo elective cesarean delivery. Therefore, it is important that health practitioners educate women beginning in the antenatal period who plan to undergo cesarean delivery by emphasizing the importance of early initiation of breastfeeding.",

Research questions: 1) Which areas in life are important to quality of life, and which are influenced by the disease and by having oral or enteral nutrition; and 2) Which areas in life are influenced by having a nasogastric feeding tube (NGT) or a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube? Material and methods . Data were collected in 36 patients. Semi-structured interviews were conducted using an extended version of the Schedule for the Evaluation of Individual Quality of Life (SEIQoL) and analysed with content analysis. Results . Negative and positive experiences of quality of life in general were about relation to family, own health, and leisure activities. Negative impacts on physical, psychological, existential and social problems, but also positive experiences are described by the patients related to the disease. More than half expressed eating-related problems. Enteral nutrition entailed negative and positive experiences, and no greater variations were described by the patients with NGT or PEG tube. Overall, there were interindividual variations. Conclusions . The patients\u2019 perception of general or disease-related quality of life was not affected by whether they had enteral nutrition or not. From the patients\u2019 perspective neither of the two feeding tubes (NGT or PEG) was clearly in favour.

Unfortunately, the measurement repeatability and reproducibility of evaporative resistance are rather low due to the complicated moisture transfer processes through clothing.

A small amount of heated composite material was placed in a round mold (diameter 6mm; 0.65mm thick), covered with Mylar sheet, pressed and polymerized with Bluephase LED unit. One group of samples were polymerized directly, and the other group through 2mm thick CAD/CAM ceramic-reinforced polymer (CRP) and CAD/CAM lithium disilicate ceramic (LDC) overlay for 20 and 40 seconds. The polymerized samples were placed immediately after curing in a lymphocyte cell culture. The viability of peripheral blood lymphocytes was evaluated using a dye exclusion technique by simultaneous staining with ethidium bromide and acridine orange. Quantitative assessments were made by determination of the percentage of viable, apoptotic and necrotic cells. The Pearson chi-square test was used for statistical analysis. In case of 20 seconds polymerization, the highest number of viable cells polymerization were recorded when materials were heated at 37\u00b0C (T1), while in case of 40 seconds polymerization, the highest number of viable cells were recorded when the materials were heated at 54\u00b0C (T2). The samples polymerized through CAD/CAM overlays showed less cytotoxicity than samples polymerized directly. Apart from composite material composition, the cell viability was also influenced by curing time, temperature of pre-heating and polymerization pattern.",

Potentially reduced risk products (PRRPs) such as e-cigarettes (EC) and tobacco heating products (THP) produce chemically less complex aerosols with significantly reduced levels of toxicants, particles and odour. However, the potential effects of EC and THP aerosols on the staining of indoor surfaces are currently unknown. In this study, an exposure chamber was developed as a model system to enable the accelerated staining of wallpaper and cotton samples by a scientific reference cigarette (3R4F), three THP (glo\u2122, glo\u2122 pro, glo\u2122 sens) and an e-cigarette (iSwitch Maxx). Exposure to 3R4F reference cigarettes caused the greatest level of staining, which was significantly higher than glo\u2122, glo\u2122 pro, glo\u2122 sens or iSwitch Maxx aerosols, all of which showed relatively little colour change. Exposure to 200\u20131000 puffs of 3R4F cigarette smoke resulted in a visible dose response effect to wallpaper and cotton samples which was not observed following exposure to glo\u2122, glo\u2122 pro, glo\u2122 sens or iSwitch Maxx aerosols. Aging of the samples for 4 weeks post-exposure resulted in changes to the staining levels, however PRRP staining levels were minimal and significantly lower than 3R4F exposed samples.

CS exposure significantly increased the level of wallpaper and cotton staining, whereas exposure to glo\u2122, glo\u2122 pro, glo\u2122 sens or iSwitch Maxx aerosols resulted in significantly reduced levels of staining, staining levels were also comparable to untreated control samples.

Participants in the EAT 2010\u20132018 (Eating and Activity over Time) study were invited to complete the C\u2010EAT (COVID\u201019 EAT) survey in April\u2013May 2020. There were 720 respondents to the survey (age: 24.7\u2009\u00b1\u20092.0\u2009years). Psychological distress, stress, stress management, financial difficulties, and food insecurity during the COVID\u201019 pandemic were examined as cross\u2010sectional correlates of disordered eating in 2020. Open\u2010ended questions assessed the perceived impact of the pandemic on eating behaviors. Low stress management was significantly associated with a higher count of extreme unhealthy weight control behaviors (UWCBs). Food insecurity, higher depressive symptoms, and financial difficulties were significantly associated with a higher count of less extreme UWCBs. Higher stress and depressive symptoms were significantly associated with greater odds of binge eating. Six themes pertaining to disordered eating during the pandemic emerged: (a) mindless eating and snacking; (b) increased food consumption; (c) generalized decrease in appetite or dietary intake; (d) eating to cope; (e) pandemic\u2010related reductions in dietary intake; and (f) re\u2010emergence or marked increase in eating disorder symptoms. Psychological distress, stress management, financial difficulties, and abrupt schedule changes may have contributed to disordered eating during the COVID\u201019 pandemic. Interventions that target stress management, depressive symptoms, and financial strain and provide tools to develop a routine may be particularly effective for emerging adults at risk of developing disordered eating during public health crises.",

    "abstract": " Over 20% of the world's tropical forests have been selectively logged, and large expanses are allocated for future timber extraction. Reduced\u2010impact logging ( RIL ) is being promoted as best practice forestry that increases sustainability and lowers CO  2 emissions from logging, by reducing collateral damage associated with timber extraction. RIL is also expected to minimize the impacts of selective logging on biodiversity, although this is yet to be thoroughly tested. We undertake the most comprehensive study to date to investigate the biodiversity impacts of RIL across multiple taxonomic groups. We quantified birds, bats and large mammal assemblage structures, using a before\u2010after control\u2010impact ( BACI ) design across 20 sample sites over a 5\u2010year period. Faunal surveys utilized point counts, mist nets and line transects and yielded >250 species. We examined assemblage responses to logging, as well as partitions of feeding guild and strata (understorey vs. canopy), and then tested for relationships with logging intensity to assess the primary determinants of community composition. Community analysis revealed little effect of RIL on overall assemblages, as structure and composition were similar before and after logging, and between logging and control sites. Variation in bird assemblages was explained by natural rates of change over time, and not logging intensity. However, when partitioned by feeding guild and strata, the frugivorous and canopy bird ensembles changed as a result of RIL , although the latter was also associated with change over time. Bats exhibited variable changes post\u2010logging that were not related to logging, whereas large mammals showed no change at all. Indicator species analysis and correlations with logging intensities revealed that some species exhibited idiosyncratic responses to RIL , whilst abundance change of most others was associated with time.  Synthesis and applications . Our study demonstrates the relatively benign effect of reduced\u2010impact logging ( RIL ) on birds, bats and large mammals in a neotropical forest context, and therefore, we propose that forest managers should improve timber extraction techniques more widely. If RIL is extensively adopted, forestry concessions could represent sizeable and important additions to the global conservation estate \u2013 over 4\u00a0million km 2 .  Over 20% of the world's tropical forests have been selectively logged, and large expanses are allocated for future timber extraction.

Community analysis revealed little effect of RIL on overall assemblages, as structure and composition were similar before and after logging, and between logging and control sites. Variation in bird assemblages was explained by natural rates of change over time, and not logging intensity. However, when partitioned by feeding guild and strata, the frugivorous and canopy bird ensembles changed as a result of RIL , although the latter was also associated with change over time. Bats exhibited variable changes post\u2010logging that were not related to logging, whereas large mammals showed no change at all. Indicator species analysis and correlations with logging intensities revealed that some species exhibited idiosyncratic responses to RIL , whilst abundance change of most others was associated with time.  Synthesis and applications . Our study demonstrates the relatively benign effect of reduced\u2010impact logging ( RIL ) on birds, bats and large mammals in a neotropical forest context, and therefore, we propose that forest managers should improve timber extraction techniques more widely. If RIL is extensively adopted, forestry concessions could represent sizeable and important additions to the global conservation estate \u2013 over 4\u00a0million km 2 .

    "abstract": "To examine the effect of mindfulness-based training on performance and mental health among a group of elite athletes. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of mindful sport performance enhancement (MSPE) on mental health, flow state, and competitive state anxiety using a 4-week workshop. We recruited an amateur baseball team (N=21) in Taiwan, and collected information by self-reported questionnaires administered before, immediately after, and at a 4-week follow-up. The primary outcome was to evaluate sports performance by flow state and competitive state anxiety, which included self-confidence, somatic anxiety, and cognitive anxiety. The secondary outcome was to explore whether MSPE intervention can improve anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, and eating disorders. After the workshop and follow-up 1 month later, we found improvements in flow state ( P =0.001; P =0.045), cognitive anxiety in competitive anxiety ( P =0.056; P =0.008), global eating disorder ( P =0.009; P <0.001), marked shape concern ( P =0.005; P <0.001), and weight concern ( P =0.007; P <0.001). Scores of sleep disturbance ( P =0.047) showed significant improvement at follow-up. We also found significant association between flow state and mindfulness ability ( P <0.001). This is the first mindfulness intervention to enhance athletes\u2019 performance in Taiwan, and also the first application of MSPE for team sports. Our study results suggested that mindfulness ability is associated with flow state, and that MSPE is a promising training program for strengthening flow state and mental health.",

This is an ideal approach for physical and emotional development of babies, as well as for the recovery of mothers. This study was aimed to determine the effect of breastfeeding education based on the health belief model (HBM) toward primiparous women. In a case\u2013control group, quasi-experimental study, 88 subjects were allocated in control and experimental groups. Subjects who were assigned to the experimental group were provided a program consisting of group education based on HBM during their prenatal period. Instrument for data gathering was made by the researchers and standard questionnaire from Dennis and Faux for Breastfeeding Self-efficacy Scale (BSES). Baseline interviews were conducted before delivery and follow-up visits were conducted after 30 days and at the fourth month after delivery. Data were analyzed using SPSS (version 16) with c 2 , independent sample t -tests, and paired t -test. Mean age of pregnant women who participated in the study was 22 \u00b1 3.29 years. After the program, the experimental group had significantly better scores in terms of self-efficacy, knowledge, and attitude scores statistically. In the fourth month, the mean of child weight in the experimental group was significantly higher than that of the control group ( P =0.001) and exclusive breastfeeding was significantly higher than in the control group ( P =0.007). Prenatal education in this study based on HBM was successful, and knowledge, attitude, self-efficacy, and related indicators improved. The necessity of producing standard education package and education of pregnant mothers, especially in their first pregnancy, by health professionals is perceived.",

    "abstract": "Precision feeding ( PF ) with the daily mixing of 2 diets with different lysine content (high (H) or low (L) ) was previously reported for growing pigs to reduce protein intake and N excretion compared with a conventional feeding (CF) based on a single diet (C) . Using a simulation approach based on farm data, the objective of the present paper was to describe and evaluate a decision support system for the PF of gestating sows allowing the daily distribution of a tailored ration to each sow. Two datasets, 1 of 2,511 gestations (farm A) and 1 of 2,528 gestations (farm B), reporting sows\u2019 characteristics at insemination and objectives at farrowing were used as inputs for a Python model. This model, mainly based on InraPorc, calculates the nutrient requirements of each sow over gestation and simulates the impact of PF in comparison to CF. Simulated diets L, H, and C contained 3.0, 6.5, and 4.8 g/kg of standardized ileal digestible lysine ( SID Lys ) and 2.0, 3.3, and 2.5 g/kg of standardized total tract digestible phosphorus ( STTD-P ), respectively. The influence of farm, parity, gestation week, and their interactions, on calculated SID Lys and STTD-P requirements was analyzed applying a mixed model. The calculated SID Lys and STTD-P requirements increased markedly in the last third of gestation ( P < 0.01) and were higher for primiparous than for multiparous sows, unless after week 14 for STTD-P requirement. The calculated SID AA and mineral requirements were lower for farm B than farm A (respectively, 2.94 vs. 3.08 g/kg for SID Lys and 1.30 vs. 1.35 g/kg for STTD-P, P < 0.01). On average, feed L represented 86% and 92% of the feed projected to be delivered by the PF strategy in farms A and B, respectively. Compared to CF, average calculated dietary SID Lys content was lowered by 27% and 32% with PF, for farms A and B, respectively, while average calculated dietary phosphorus content was lowered by 13% and 16%. The simulated proportions of sows in excess and deficient in SID Lys were reduced with PF. Compared to CF, the PF strategy allowed for a 3.6% reduction in simulated feed cost per sow during gestation, and reduced nitrogen and phosphorus intake (by 11.0% and 13.8%, respectively) and excretion (by 16.7% and 15.4%, respectively). To conclude, these simulations indicate that PF of gestating sow appears to be relevant to meet the amino acid requirement while reducing feed cost, and supplies and excretion of nitrogen and phosphorus.",

A follow-up examination when the patient was 5 mo old revealed severe hypercholesterolemia. Familial hypercholesterolemia was first suspected because of the patient\u2019s significantly high levels of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The parent\u2019s serum lipid profiles were examined and found to be normal. He was completely breast-fed until 6 mo of age. Breast milk was still the main source of food for a period following weaning. At 14 mo old, the patient was weaned completely from breast milk, and his serum cholesterol levels decreased dramatically. According to the normal lipid profiles of the patient\u2019s parents and the spontaneous normalization of serum cholesterol levels after complete weaning from breast milk, breast-feeding was suggested to be responsible for his transient severe hypercholesterolemia. It is well documented that breast-fed infants have higher serum cholesterol levels than formula-fed infants. However, there is no reported case with severe hypercholesterolemia equivalent to or higher than the levels observed in the case of familial hypercholesterolemia. Although the exact mechanism is unknown, it is necessary to consider that a small number of cases develop severe hypercholesterolemia related to breast-feeding.",

Despite the numerous studies on the effect traditional media has on body image, very few have focused on the effect of newer forms of media (e.g. online media). And almost none have looked at the relationship between time spent online and body image. To study the associations between time spent on the internet, body image satisfaction and eating behaviors of students grades 7 to 12 in the Thai educational system.

Mean (sd) age of the sample was 15.7 (1.9) years, 246 participants (39.7%) were male and 374 (60.3%) were female. Using the internet and social networks for content related to body image and eating behaviors, was negatively associated with body image satisfaction but positively associated with inappropriate eating attitudes/behaviors, binging, purging, use of laxatives/diuretics and drive for muscularity with respect to behaviors and attitudes, and was associated with eating behaviors that carried a risk for obesity.

The \u2018bogus\u2019 taste test is a measure widely used in eating behaviour research to identify factors that may have a causal effect on food intake. However, there has been no examination of the validity of the bogus taste test as a measure of food intake. We conducted a participant level analysis of 31 published laboratory studies that used the taste test to measure food intake. We assessed whether the taste test was sensitive to experimental manipulations hypothesized to increase or decrease food intake. We examined construct validity by testing whether participant sex, hunger and liking of taste test food were associated with the amount of food consumed in the taste test. In addition, we also examined whether BMI (body mass index), trait measures of dietary restraint and over-eating in response to palatable food cues were associated with food consumption. Results indicated that the taste test was sensitive to experimental manipulations hypothesized to increase or decrease food intake. Factors that were reliably associated with increased consumption during the taste test were being male, have a higher baseline hunger, liking of the taste test food and a greater tendency to overeat in response to palatable food cues, whereas trait dietary restraint and BMI were not. These results indicate that the bogus taste test is likely to be a valid measure of food intake and can be used to identify factors that have a causal effect on food intake.",

    "abstract": "Supplemental Digital Content is Available in the Text. Antiretroviral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for the prevention of HIV acquisition is cost-effective when delivered to those at substantial risk. Despite a high incidence of HIV infection among pregnant and breastfeeding women in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), a theoretical increased risk of preterm birth on PrEP could outweigh the HIV prevention benefit. We developed a decision analytic model to evaluate a strategy of daily oral PrEP during pregnancy and breastfeeding in SSA. We approached the analysis from a health care system perspective across a lifetime time horizon. Model inputs were derived from existing literature and local sources. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of PrEP versus no PrEP was calculated in 2015 U.S. dollars per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. We evaluated the effect of uncertainty in baseline estimates through one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. PrEP administered to pregnant and breastfeeding women in SSA was cost-effective. In a base case of 10,000 women, the administration of PrEP averted 381 HIV infections but resulted in 779 more preterm births. PrEP was more costly per person ($450 versus $117), but resulted in fewer disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) (3.15 versus 3.49). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $965/DALY averted was below the recommended regional threshold for cost-effectiveness of $6462/DALY. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated robustness of the model. Providing PrEP to pregnant and breastfeeding women in SSA is likely cost-effective, although more data are needed about adherence and safety. For populations at high risk of HIV acquisition, PrEP may be considered as part of a broader combination HIV prevention strategy.",

We examined whether pre\u2010migration potentially traumatic experiences (PTEs) or perceived discrimination (PD) are associated with substance use among migrants with voluntary (Russians) and forced (Kurds) migration backgrounds. Cross\u2010sectional interview and health examination data from the Finnish Migrant Health and Wellbeing Study were used. The target sample ( n =\u00a01000 for each group) was drawn from the national population register using stratified random sampling by participants\u2019 country of birth and native language. Population\u2010based data were collected from six cities in Finland during 2010\u201312. The participation rates were 68% (Russians) and 59% (Kurds). The analytical sample size varied (Russians n =\u00a0442\u2013687, Kurds n =\u00a0459\u2013613), as some participants completed only interview, health examination or short interview. The majority of Kurds had a refugee background (75%) while Russians had mainly migrated for other reasons (99%). The three main outcomes were self\u2010reported binge drinking, daily smoking and life\u2010time cannabis use. PTEs and PD were self\u2010reported in the interview. Socio\u2010demographic background, migration\u2010related factors and current affective symptoms were adjusted for. Among Kurds, PTEs were associated with binge drinking [adjusted odds ratio (aOR)\u00a0=\u00a02.65, 95% confidence interval (CI)\u00a0=\u00a01.30\u20135.42] and PD was associated with life\u2010time cannabis use (aOR\u00a0=\u00a03.89, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a01.38\u201310.97) after adjusting for contextual factors.

Although healthy habits such as eating breakfast, weight control, and regular sleep increase the lifespan in adults, the effects of healthy habits on school-age children have not been studied much. The present study aimed at investigating the impact of an educational program based on Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) on eating breakfast among middle school students. This interventional study was conducted on sixth-grade students in Qom City during the academic year 2012\u20132013. First, 97 students were randomly assigned to the experimental group and 97 other students were assigned to the control group. Then, a questionnaire was developed on eating breakfast by the researchers according to the TPB. A pilot study was conducted to assess the reliability of the questionnaire. To assess the validity of the questionnaire, advice by a panel of experts was sought. To carry out a pre-test, both groups answered the questions. After analyzing the pre-test results, the required content was developed for the experimental group. Educational methods included delivering speech, discussion groups, pamphlets, and posters. The required educationalcontent was provided for students during five sessions and for parents in one session. To determine the effect of educational intervention, a post-test study was carried out 2 months after the intervention. Collected data were analyzed using independent t -test, \u03c7, [2] and repeated measures. In the experimental group, 36.7% of students were eating breakfast at least in a day of a week, before educational intervention. After implementation of the educational program, only 32.7% of them were continuing their past habit. There was a significant difference between themean scores of attitudes, perceived behavioral control, intention, and practice of eating breakfast in the experimental and control groups ( P < 0.05), while there was no significant difference between the mean scores of subjective norms after implementing the educational program in both groups ( P < 0.26). Using the TPB improved students\u2019 intentions and behavior of eating breakfast. Thus, it seems necessary to consider all effective environmental factors on the subjective norms in the education of healthy eating behaviors or improving breakfast-eating practice among students.",

This was a crossover randomized controlled trial that was conducted on 40 obese or overweight clerical staff of the university. The staff was invited to have lunch randomly, receiving either a large or a small set of plate, spoon, and fork. Washout period was 3 weeks, and the participants were then invited to have lunch in a second intervention period and received opposite sizes of dishes compared to the first period sizes. The meal was composed of roasted chicken (kebab), cooked rice, vegetable salad, dairy drink, and soda. Changes in food intake between large and small utensils (plate, spoon, and fork) were analyzed with paired t -test. Rice intake using small or large eating utensils was different ( P = 0.02). But total energy intake was not different. The Pearson correlation test demonstrated a positive and significant correlation between rice consumption and waist-to-hip ratio ( P = 0.02). Soda ( P = 0.02), carbohydrate ( P = 0.01), and total energy intake ( P = 0.03) were negatively correlated with the age of the participant. It seems that only the amount of grain products consumption changes with changing in dishware size with no significant effect on total energy intake. It is recommended that the independent effect of visual cues on food intake for foods with different textures be investigated in future studies.",

A total of 602 women were included in the study. A structured form was used to assess the extent of feeding and the reasons for not breastfeeding in the first \u00bd to 1 hour after birth. The frequency and the percentage were used to compare the data. It was encouraging to find that 60% of the women breastfed their babies within \u00bd an hour to 1 hour after birth. Of the reasons for not breastfeeding the babies early, two were of the greatest concern. The first is that 13% of the women were either too tired to breastfeed or refused to do so at this early stage. Secondly, the majority of the mothers who had had cesarean sections did not breastfeed their babies. Mothers and their families play a very vital role in building the health of the nation. This can be achieved by early breastfeeding, which contributes to the rearing of healthy babies, increase in intelligence and the building of strong future generations.

    "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa is a serious disorder, which often takes a chronic course. Early treatment leads to a significantly better prognosis and prevents chronicity. However, existing evidence on facilitators and barriers in anorexia nervosa treatment initiation is scarce. Against this background, the FABIANA study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03713541) aims to (a) identify potentially modifiable facilitators and barriers from the perspectives of adolescent and adult patients with anorexia nervosa, carers and physicians, (b) develop and test an instrument for the combined assessment of multiple key facilitators and barriers, and (c) quantify the effect of potentially modifiable versus non-modifiable key facilitators and barriers on the duration of untreated illness (DUI) in patients with anorexia nervosa. FABIANA is an observational, mixed-method-study divided into three consecutive substudies each corresponding to one of the study aims. All three substudies will include female patients with anorexia nervosa aged 14 years and older at the beginning of their first psychotherapeutic anorexia nervosa treatment. The qualitative substudy I and the quantitative substudy III will additionally include carers and involved physicians. The recruitment will take place at 20 cooperating study centres throughout Germany, which provide in-patient or out-patient anorexia nervosa specialist care. The DUI will be calculated based on the month of illness onset as determined in validated interviews on lifetime anorexia nervosa symptoms and the therapist-reported date of treatment initiation. Strengths and limitations of the retrospective assessment of the DUI will be discussed. The findings of the FABIANA study will contribute to the development of evidence-based early-intervention approaches and the prevention of a chronic course of illness.

    "abstract": "First Nations (FN) women have a higher risk of diabetes than non-FN women in Canada. Prenatal education and breastfeeding may reduce the risk of diabetes in mothers and offspring. The rates of breastfeeding initiation and participation in the prenatal program are low in FN communities. A prenatal educational website, social media-assisted prenatal chat groups and community support teams were developed in three rural or remote FN communities in Manitoba. The rates of participation of pregnant women in prenatal programs and breastfeeding initiation were compared before and after the start of the remote prenatal education program within 2014-2017. The participation rate of FN pregnant women in rural or remote communities in the prenatal program and breastfeeding initiation during 1-year after the start of the community-based remote prenatal education program were significantly increased compared to that during 1-year before the start of the program (54% versus 36% for the participation rate, 50% versus 34% for breastfeeding initiation, p <\u00a00\u00b7001). Availability of high-speed Wi-Fi and/or postpartum supporting team were associated with favorite study outcomes. Positive feedback on the remote prenatal education was received from participants. The findings suggest that remote prenatal education is feasible and effective for improving the breastfeeding rate and engaging pregnant women to participate in the prenatal program in rural or remote FN communities. The remote prenatal education remained active during COVID-19 in the participating communities, which suggests an advantage to expand remote prenatal education in other Indigenous communities.

    "abstract": "Women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) face big challenges of breastfeeding. In order to improve breastfeeding self-efficacy and breastfeeding rate of them, we formulated perinatal individualized interventions based on self-efficacy theory and conducted a randomized controlled trial to verify the effectiveness. We conducted a randomized controlled trial. The perinatal individualized interventions based on the self-efficacy theory including 4 phases were led by the International Board Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC). Women allocated to the control group received usual care for lactation support during the antenatal and postnatal period. Data collection occurred at admission, discharge, 6 weeks postpartum, 4 months postpartum, and 6 months postpartum. We enrolled 226 women with GDM, 113 in the intervention group and 113 in the control group. The scores of breastfeeding self-efficacy in the intervention group were significantly higher than those in the control group at discharge, at 6 weeks, 4 months, and 6 months postpartum ( P <\u200a.05). We found higher rates of exclusive and any breastfeeding in the intervention group at discharge (Exclusive: 25.2% vs 13.5%, P <\u200a.05; Any: 94.4% vs 89.4%, P >\u200a.05), at 6 weeks postpartum (Exclusive: 75.5% vs 62.5%, P <\u200a.05; Any: 100.0% vs 96.2%, P >\u200a.05), at 4 months postpartum (Exclusive: 68.9% vs 43.3%, P <\u200a.05; Any: 94.3% vs 83.7%, P <\u200a.05) and at 6 months postpartum (Exclusive: 55.8% vs 36.9%, P <\u200a.05; Any: 88.5% vs 64.1%, P <\u200a.05).

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that obesity in Israeli children is associated with chronically increased hunger and to examine for persistent abnormalities of satiation and between-meal satiety in these children. The parents of 200 children with obesity and 100 normal-weight children completed a questionnaire together with their child that rated hunger, food intake at main meal, and speed of eating. Time to hunger from the main meal was also recorded. Children with hunger ratings above 4 on a 7-point scale were considered to have persistent hunger. Food intake ratings at the main meal were used as an approximate indicator of satiation and time from main meal to feeling hunger as an approximate indicator of between-meal satiety. There were marked differences between children with obesity and controls for hunger, food intake at main meal and speed of eating ratings (all p<0.001). The difference to time to hunger reached significance after adjusting for age and sex (p=0.048). 41% of the children with obesity had the highest rating for persistent hunger versus 5% of controls (p<0.001). Persistent hunger, abnormal food intake at the main meal and rapid eating are common in children with obesity and are often of marked degree. These findings could have implications for understanding how pediatric obesity perpetuates itself and even worsens and its resistance to successful treatment over the long term.",

    "abstract": "Between 1998 and 2009 reported exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) rates in South African infants, aged 0\u20136 months, ranged from 6.2% to 25.7%. In 2011, the National Minister of Health shifted policy to promote \u2018exclusive\u2019 breast feeding for all women in South Africa irrespective of HIV status (Tshwane Declaration of Support for Breastfeeding in South Africa). This analysis examines early EBF prior to and through implementation of the declaration. Data from the three South Africa national, cross-sectional, facility-based surveys, conducted in 2010, 2011\u201312 and 2012\u201313, were analysed. Primary health facilities (n=580) were randomly selected after a stratified multistage probability proportional-to-size sampling to provide valid national and provincial estimates. A national sample of all infants attending their 6\u2009weeks vaccination at selected facilities. The number of caregiver-infant pairs enrolled were 10 182, 10\u2009106 and 9120 in 2010, 2011\u201312, and 2012\u201313, respectively. Exclusive breast feeding as measured using structured 24\u2009hours recall plus prior 7 days (8 days inclusive prior to day interview) and WHO definition. The adjusted OR comparing EBF prevalence in 2011\u201312 and 2012\u201313 with 2010 were 2.08 and 5.51, respectively. Mothers with generally higher socioeconomic status, HIV-positive, unplanned pregnancy, primipara, postcaesarean delivery, resided in certain provinces and women who did not receive breastfeeding counselling had significantly lower odds of EBF. With what seemed to be an intransigently low EBF rate since 1998, South Africa saw an increase in early EBF for infants aged 4\u20138 weeks from 2010 to 2013, coinciding with a major national breastfeeding policy change. These increases were seen across all provinces and subgroups, suggesting a population-wide effect, rather than an increase in certain subgroups or locations. While these increases in EBF were significant, the 59.1% prevalence is still below desired levels of early EBF. Further improvements in EBF programmes are needed.",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to describe and compare breastfeeding progression, infants' feeding behaviours, maternal feeding difficulties, and mothers' usage of breastfeeding interventions for singleton late preterm (LPT) and term infants. A further aim was to identify associated factors for exclusive breastfeeding at breast at 1 month in LPT infants. This was a cohort study where mothers of LPT infants from a neonatal unit ( n = 60), LPT infants from a maternity unit ( n = 62), and term infants from a maternity unit ( n = 269) answered a questionnaire approximately 1 month after delivery. Findings showed no significant differences in exclusive breastfeeding at breasts between LPT infants admitted to the neonatal unit compared with the maternity unit, during the first week at home (38% vs. 48%), or at 1 month of age (52% vs. 50%). Term infants were more likely to be exclusively breastfed at the breast (86% and 74%, p < 0.05) compared with LPT infants. Multiple regression analysis showed that usage of a nipple shield, not feeding breast milk exclusively during the first week at home, or feeding less than 10 times per day at 1 month were statistically significant for not exclusively breastfeed at the breast. A protective factor was the mothers' experience of having an abundance of milk during the first week at home. In conclusion, LPT infants are less likely to be exclusively breastfed at the breast than term infants, highlighting the need for further research to guide interventions aimed at optimising exclusive breastfeeding rates.",

    "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic caused France to impose a strict lockdown, affecting families' habits in many domains. This study evaluated possible changes in child eating behaviors, parental feeding practices, and parental motivations when buying food during the lockdown, compared to the period before the lockdown. Parents of 498 children aged 3\u201312 years (238 boys; M =\u00a07.32; SD =\u00a02.27) completed an online survey with items from validated questionnaires (e.g., CEDQ, CEBQ, HomeSTEAD). They reported on their (child's) current situation during the lockdown, and retrospectively on the period before the lockdown. Many parents reported changes in child eating behaviors, feeding practices, and food shopping motivations. When changes occurred, child appetite, food enjoyment, food responsiveness and emotional overeating significantly increased during the lockdown. Increased child boredom significantly predicted increased food responsiveness, emotional overeating and snack frequency in between meals. When parents changed their practices, they generally became more permissive: less rules, more soothing with food, more child autonomy. They bought pleasurable and sustainable foods more frequently, prepared more home-cooked meals and cooked more with the child. Level of education and increased stress level predicted changes in parental practices and motivations. This study provides insights in factors that can induce positive and negative changes in families' eating, feeding and cooking behaviors. This can stimulate future studies and interventions.",

A cluster-randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 19 hospitals, divided into two groups: the B group ( n = 10 hospitals; B.\u2009bifidum given to infants within 48\u2009h of birth) and the P group ( n = 9 hospitals; infants received a placebo). The primary outcome was establishment of enteral feeding after birth, defined as the postnatal day at which enteral feeding exceeded 100\u2009mL/(kg/day). Secondary outcomes were defined as incidence of morbidity and somatic growth before discharge. Overall, 283 VLBW infants were enrolled in the study: B group, n = 153; and P group, n = 130.

The objective of this study was to clarify which factor produced when feed boluses enter the rumen is mainly responsible for the marked increase in water intake in the second hour of the 2 h feeding period in large-type goats fed on dry forage for 2 h twice daily. Six large-type male esophageal- and ruminal-fistulated goats (crossbred Japanese Saanen/Nubian, aged 2 to 6 years, weighing 85.1\u00b14.89 kg) were used in two experiments. In experiment 1, the water deprivation (WD) control and the water availability (WA) treatment were conducted to compare changes in water intake during and after dry forage feeding. In experiment 2, a normal feeding conditions (NFC) control and a feed bolus removal (FBR) treatment were carried out to investigate whether decrease in circulating plasma volume or increase in plasma osmolality is mainly responsible for the marked increase in water intake in the second hour of the 2 h feeding period. The results of experiment 1 showed that in the WA treatment, small amounts of water were consumed during the first hour of feeding while the majority of water intake was observed during the second hour of the 2 h feeding period. Therefore, the amounts of water consumed in the second hour of the 2 h feeding period accounted for 82.8% of the total water intake. The results of experiment 2 indicated that in comparison with the NFC control, decrease in plasma volume in the FBR treatment, which was indicated by increase in hematocrit and plasma total protein concentrations, was higher (p<0.05) in the second hour of the 2 h feeding period. However, plasma osmolality in the FBR treatment was lower (p<0.05) than compared to the NFC control from 30 min after the start of feeding. Therefore, thirst level in the FBR treatment was 82.7% less (p<0.01) compared with that in the NFC control upon conclusion of the 30 min drinking period. The results of the study indicate that the increased plasma osmolality in the second hour of the 2 h feeding period is the main physiological stimulating factor of water intake during and after dry forage feeding in large-type goats.",

LPS-induced anorexia depends on COX-2, but not in brain endothelial, myeloid or neural cells. LPS-induced anorexia and fever are elicited by prostaglandin synthesis in distinct cell groups. Conditioned taste aversion induced by LPS is prostaglandin-independent. Systemic inflammation evokes an array of brain-mediated responses including fever, anorexia and taste aversion. Both fever and anorexia are prostaglandin dependent but it has been unclear if the cell-type that synthesizes the critical prostaglandins is the same. Here we show that pharmacological inhibition or genetic deletion of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, but not of COX-1, attenuates inflammation-induced anorexia. Mice with deletions of COX-2 selectively in brain endothelial cells displayed attenuated fever, as demonstrated previously, but intact anorexia in response to peripherally injected lipopolysaccharide (10\u00a0\u03bcg/kg). Whereas intracerebroventricular injection of a cyclooxygenase inhibitor markedly reduced anorexia, deletion of COX-2 selectively in neural cells, in myeloid cells or in both brain endothelial and neural cells had no effect on LPS-induced anorexia. In addition, COX-2 in myeloid and neural cells was dispensable for the fever response. Inflammation-induced conditioned taste aversion did not involve prostaglandin signaling at all. These findings collectively show that anorexia, fever and taste aversion are triggered by distinct routes of immune-to-brain signaling.",

The study aims to analyze the prevalence and the possible risk or protective factors concerning the pathology of breastfeeding. For this observational study were consulted the medical records and the files of the Breastfeeding clinic of 1065 puerperal women, of the University Hospital of Modena, from January to August 2016. The data were processed with the SPSS Software.

While the physical health and nutritional benefits of breastfeeding for the mother and child are relatively well established, the evidence for psychological effects is less clear. This study aimed to examine whether there is an association between breastfeeding and later conduct problems in children. It also considered the extent to which any relationship is attributable to maternally-provided inherited characteristics that influence both likelihood of breastfeeding and child conduct problems. A prenatal cross-fostering design with a sample of 870 families with a child aged 4\u201311\u00a0years was used. Mothers were genetically related or unrelated to their child as a result of assisted reproductive technologies. The relationship between breastfeeding and conduct problems was assessed while controlling for theorised measured confounders by multivariate regression (e.g. maternal smoking, education, and antisocial behaviour), and for unmeasured inherited factors by testing associations separately for related and unrelated mother-child pairs. Breastfeeding was associated with lower levels of conduct disorder symptoms in offspring in middle childhood. Breastfeeding was associated with lower levels of conduct problems even after controlling for observed confounders in the genetically related group, but not in the genetically unrelated group. In contrast, maternal antisocial behaviour showed robust associations with child conduct problems after controlling for measured and inherited confounders. These findings highlight the importance of using genetically sensitive designs in order to test causal environmental influences.",

Weight loss in chronic disease comes from both fat and lean mass, and is known as cachexia. Both alterations in appetite and body weight loss occur in a wide variety of diseases, including cancer, heart failure, renal failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and HIV. An increase in circulating inflammatory cytokines has been implicated as a uniting pathogenic mechanism of cachexia and associated anorexia. One of the targets of inflammatory mediators is the central nervous system, and in particular feeding centers in the hypothalamus located in the ventral diencephalon. Current research has begun to elucidate the mechanisms by which inflammation reaches the hypothalamus, and the neural substrates underlying inflammatory anorexia. Research into these neural mechanisms has suggested new therapeutic possibilities, which have produced promising results in preclinical and clinical trials. This review will discuss inflammatory signaling in the hypothalamus that mediates anorexia, and the opportunities for therapeutic intervention that these mechanisms present.",

Enteral tube feeding is generally considered the preferred modality for critically ill pediatric patients. Clinical advantages of using peptide-based formulas are still controversial in critically ill children. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of a peptide-based formula versus a standard polymeric formula on feeding tolerance and whether this will affect the outcome among critically ill children. This single blind case control study was conducted on 180 randomly selected critically ill children in the pediatric critical care unit (PICU) of Ain Shams University. Patients were divided into 2 groups: a group receiving a standard polymeric formula (group 1; 90 patients) and a group receiving a peptide-based formula (group II; 90 patients). Nutritional requirements, days to reach full enteral feeding, feeding intolerance symptoms and anthropometric measurements were recorded for all patients at admission together with their pediatric risk of mortality score (PRISM). Length of PICU stay, occurrence of sepsis together with survival were analyzed at discharge as outcome measures. Patients receiving a peptide-based formula showed a significant decrease in feeding interruptions and abdominal distention ( p < 0.000), reached full enteral feeding faster (2.60 \u00b10.74 days versus 5.36 \u00b11.00 days in patients received polymeric standard formula; p < 0.001) and improved weight gain ( p < 0.028). Moreover, duration of sepsis was significantly shorter ( p < 0.045), but no difference in mortality was recorded between patient groups. Peptide-based formula feeding was better tolerated than standard polymeric formula feeding in critically ill pediatric patients. However, the choice of patients receiving the peptide-based formula needs to be further evaluated.",

To find the effective lessening methods of Opisthorchis viverrini eggs in the contaminated environment, we investigated the temperature conditions for killing of these trematode eggs in vitro. Numerous O. viverrini eggs were obtained in the proximal part of uteri of adult worms from experimental hamsters. Mature eggs with miracidium were allocated by experimental groups (2 control: positive and negative and 4 treatment: 50, 60, 70, and 80\u00b0C) with 0.85% saline, and treated by the experimental plan. Eggs in each experimental groups were observed under the confocal microscope after stain with Propidium Iodide (PI) to evaluate the effect of temperatures. Eggs in 70 and 80\u00b0C groups were all killed after over 10 min heated. Majority of eggs in 60\u00b0C (10, 15, and 30 min heated), 70 and 80\u00b0C (5 min heated) groups were inactivated. However in 50\u00b0C group, below half of eggs were to be killed in all time lapse (10, 15 and 30 min). In order to prevent O. viverrini infection and cholangiocarcinoma, direct treatment of sewage by heating at 70 or 80\u00b0C at least 10 min is essential. Therefore, treatment of O. viverrini eggs at a high temperature is a potential method for controlling egg contamination in sewage.",

Dependence on the saturation index and four operating parameters was analyzed, namely: liquid temperature, surface temperature, flow rate and electrical leakage current. A focus of the study was the influence of electrical leakage current on the fouling behavior and the morphology of the deposited crystal layers. The investigation shows that the aforementioned parameters influence the fouling process and crystal size growth in a different way. The experimental results were used to find a correlation between the electrical leakage current and induction time. In addition, a modeling approach is presented which allows an estimation of the fouling mass flux.

Furthermore, since beat-to-beat variations can provide clues on the origin of arrhythmias, we analyzed the beating rate variability using a time-domain method which provides a Poincar\u00e9 plot. Data were further correlated to cell phenotypes. Immunofluorescence and calcium imaging analysis showed that mutant lamin changed NRVMs beating force and frequency. Additionally, we noted an altered microtubule network organization with shorter filament length, and defective hemichannel membrane localization (Connexin 43).

    "abstract": "Aging is linked to physiological and pathophysiological changes. In this context, elderly patients often are frail, which strongly correlates with negative health outcomes and disability. Elderly patients are often malnourished, which again is an independent risk factor for both frailty and adverse clinical outcomes. Malnutrition and resulting frailty can be prevented by adequate nutritional interventions. Yet, use of nutritional therapy can also have negative consequences, including a potentially life-threatening metabolic alteration called refeeding syndrome (RFS) in high-risk patients. RFS is characterized by severe electrolyte shifts (mainly hypophosphatemia, hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia), vitamin deficiency (mainly thiamine), fluid overload and salt retention leading to organ dysfunction and cardiac arrhythmias. Although the awareness of malnutrition among elderly people is well established, the risk of RFS is often neglected, especially in the frail elderly population. This partly relates to the unspecific clinical presentation and laboratory changes in the geriatric population. The aim of this review is to summarize recently published recommendations for the management of RFS based on current evidence from clinical studies adapted with a focus on elderly patients.",

This study was designed to investigate the relationship between chronic respiratory symptoms and bedtime bottle feeding in infants after the age of 6 months. We conducted a prospective study that included 44 infants who presented with respiratory symptoms for more than 8 weeks and also had been bottle-fed during bedtime even after 6 months of age. The infants were divided into 2 groups; infants who discontinued bedtime bottle feeding and those who did not. Respiratory symptom scores were graded with a four-point scale at 0, 1, 2 and 3 months, and were compared between the 2 groups. Twenty eight infants (63.6%) stopped being bottle-fed during bedtime and 16 infants (36.4%) were still bottle-fed. The respiratory symptom scores were significantly decreased in infants who stopped bedtime bottle feeding ( p = 0.0003). It is suggested that prolonged bedtime bottle feeding might be one of the causes of chronic respiratory symptoms in infants.",

Examining the psychometric properties of tools in societies with different cultures than western societies can help with examining the external validity of those tools. This research aimed at standardization and validation of the Eating Beliefs Questionnaire (EBQ-18) in Iran. Persian version of the EBQ-18 was produced through forward translation, reconciliation, and back translation. A total of 302 non-WEIRD nonclinical students were selected through convenience sampling method and completed a set of questionnaires, including the EBQ-18, Eating Attitude Test-16 (EAT-16), Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale-16 (DERS-16), Weight Efficacy Lifestyle Questionnaire-Short Form (SF), self-esteem scale, and self-compassion scale (SCS) short-form. The construct validity of the EBQ-18 was assessed using confirmatory factor analysis and divergent and convergent validity. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability (2 weeks\u2019 interval) were used to evaluate the reliability. Data analysis was performed using LISREL (version 8.8) and SSPS (version 22) softwares. EBQ-18 and subscales were found to be valid and reliable measures, with high test-retest reliability and good internal consistency in the nonclinical sample. Cronbrash's Alpha coefficient, for the whole of scale, negative beliefs scale, Permissive Beliefs scale, and Positive Beliefs scale were gained. 96.,89.,90, and. 94 respectively. Intraclass correlations coefficient, for the whole of scale, negative beliefs scale, Permissive Beliefs scale, and Positive Beliefs scale were gained. 84.,78.,75, and. 87, respectively. In terms of convergent validity, EBQ-18 and subscales showed a significant positive correlation with selfreport measures of EAT-16 and DERS-16 ( P < 0.01). EBQ-18 and subscales showed a negative correlation with self-compassion, self-esteem, and eating self-efficacy, thus demonstrated divergent validity with these constructs ( P < 0.01). The results showed that three factors of negative beliefs, positive beliefs, and permissive beliefs had the goodness of fit indices (root mean square error of approximation = 0.08, normed fit index = 0.97, nonnormed fit index = 0.98, comparative fit index = 0.98, and standardized root mean square residual = 0.04). The results of this study support the EBQ-18 three-factor model. These findings indicate that the EBQ-18 is a reliable measure of eating beliefs in the Iranian population.

    "abstract": "Peptide hormones synthesized in gastrointestinal and adipose tissues in addition to neuropeptides regulate appetite and body weight. Previously, autoantibodies directed against melanocortin peptides were found in patients with eating disorders; however, it remains unknown whether autoantibodies directed against other appetite-regulating peptides are present in human sera and whether their levels are influenced by gut-related antigens. Healthy women were studied for the presence of immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgA autoantibodies directed against 14 key appetite-regulating peptides. The concept of molecular mimicry was applied to search in silico whether bacteria, viruses, or fungi contain proteins with amino acid sequences identical to appetite-regulating peptides. In addition, autoantibodies serum levels were studied in germ-free and specific pathogen-free rats. We found these IgG and IgA autoantibodies directed against leptin, ghrelin, peptide YY, neuropeptide Y, and other appetite-regulating peptides are present in human sera at levels of 100\u2013900 ng/mL. Numerous cases of sequence homology with these peptides were identified among commensal and pathogenic micro-organisms including Lactobacilli , bacteroides, Helicobacter pylori , Escherichia coli , and Candida species. Decreased levels of IgA autoantibodies directed against several appetite-regulating peptides and increased levels of antighrelin IgG were found in germ-free rats compared with specific pathogen-free rats. Healthy humans and rats display autoantibodies directed against appetite-regulating peptide hormones and neuropeptides, suggesting that these autoantibodies may have physiologic implications in hunger and satiety pathways. Gut-related antigens including the intestinal microflora may influence production of theses autoantibodies, suggesting a new link between the gut and appetite control.",

We hypothesized that steers fed dry-rolled corn would have better feed efficiency (less feed necessary to the same amount of gain) than steers fed whole shelled corn. Ninety-five backgrounded Angus-cross cattle (initial body weight [BW] = 263 \u00b1 9.8 kg) were used in a randomized complete block design in a feedlot setting. Cattle were divided in to 3 blocks: heifers (n = 31, 4 pens; initial BW = 267 \u00b1 1.3 kg), light steers (n = 32, 4 pens; initial BW = 253 \u00b1 1.3 kg), and heavy steers (n = 32, 4 pens; initial BW = 279 \u00b1 1.4 kg). Diets contained 70% corn (experimental treatment), 15% dried distiller\u2019s grains with solubles, 7% grass hay, and 8% supplement, on a dry matter basis. Cattle were fed for 217, 224, and 231 \u00b1 8 d for the heifer, heavy steer, and light steer blocks, respectively. Two pens within each block were randomly assigned to one of the following treatments: (1) dry-rolled corn (DRC) or (2) whole-shelled corn (WSC). Animal growth performance and carcass characteristics were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS, including the fixed effect of treatment. Pen and block were included as random effects. Carcass characteristics USDA Yield Grade and Quality Grade distributions were compared using the GLIMMIX procedure of using the same model than the growth performance data. Data are presented as LSMeans. Cattle fed DRC had greater average daily gain (ADG; P = 0.02) and final BW ( P < 0.01) when compared with cattle fed WSC. Even though ADG was greater for the DRC treatment, feed efficiency was similar ( P = 0.45) because dry matter intake was also greater ( P = 0.04) for DRC when compared with the WSC treatment. Cattle fed DRC also had greater hot carcass weight ( P < 0.01), dressing percentage ( P < 0.01), and Longissimus dorsi muscle area ( P < 0.01) than cattle fed WSC. No differences ( P \u2265 0.18) were observed for marbling score, USDA Yield Grade or USDA Quality Grade. In conclusion, feeding DRC to feedlot cattle improved ADG, hot carcass weight, and Longissimus dorsi muscle area, without affecting feed efficiency or meat quality.",

The medical records of 143 children who had visited the feeding clinic between January 2010 and June 2014 were reviewed retrospectively. The presence of a feeding disorder (feeding behavior disorder, dysphagia, and/or failure to thrive [FTT]) and the children's medical conditions were examined by a physiatrist. Half of the patients (n=74, 51.7%) were under 15 months of age, and 68 (47.6%) were born preterm. Ninety-three patients (65.0%) met the criteria for any combination of feeding behavior disorder, dysphagia, or FTT. Cardiorespiratory disease was the most common medical condition; children with this condition were more likely to show sensory food aversion and FTT. Feeding behavior disorders were significantly associated with gastrointestinal problems, and dysphagia was significantly related to almost all medical conditions. A multidisciplinary approach to children with feeding difficulties is proposed for comprehensive evaluation and treatment because combinations of feeding problems are very common among children. This overall profile could provide clinicians with a clear understanding of the complexity of feeding disorders and their relationships with various medical conditions in children.",

The chain-referral-sampling method was used to identify Native Hawaiian k\u016bpuna knowledgeable in Hawaiian complementary feeding practices from across 4 counties in Hawai\u2018i. Interview question topics included sharing about their formative years, infant health, infant feeding, transgenerational knowledge, and opportunities and barriers related to traditional food consumption. Interviews were recorded and then transcribed. Three coders used NVivio12 to code transcripts using a priori and emergent themes. Institutional Review Board approval was received prior to data collection. Fourteen k\u016bpuna interviews were included in the analysis. A majority of the k\u016bpuna were female. Most k\u016bpuna shared that complementary feeding practices in their childhood and when their children and grandchildren were being raised reflected aspects of the traditional Hawaiian diet. Poi, or steamed mashed taro root, was the most common traditional Hawaiian dietary staple of infancy. However, k\u016bpuna shared that traditional dietary practices evolved to reflect contemporary dietary practices such as the mixing of poi with infant cereal or milk. Female family members were prominent influences on k\u016bpuna complementary feeding practices. Lifestyle and lack of knowledge were the most commonly shared reflections by k\u016bpuna on the supports and barriers, respectively, to promoting and engaging in traditional Hawaiian complementary feeding practices.

We investigated the effects of temperature and different linear or exponential methanol-feeding rates on the production of recombinant Fusarium graminearum galactose oxidase (EC 1.1.3.9) in a P. pastoris Mut + strain, under regulation of the AOX1 promoter. We found that low exponential methanol feeding led to 1.5-fold higher volumetric productivity compared to high exponential feeding rates. The duration of glycerol feeding did not affect the subsequent product yield, but longer glycerol feeding led to higher initial biomass concentration, which would reduce the oxygen demand and generate less heat during induction. A linear and a low exponential feeding profile led to productivities in the same range, but the latter was characterized by intense fluctuations in the titers of galactose oxidase and total protein. An exponential feeding profile that has been adapted to the apparent biomass concentration results in more stable cultures, but the concentration of recombinant protein is in the same range as when constant methanol feeding is employed. \u00a9 2014 The Authors Biotechnology Progress published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. on behalf of American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

Histologically, OFG is characterized by noncaseating granulomatous inflammation. The early diagnosis of OFG is essential for the better prognosis of the lesion. Delay in diagnosis of OFG results into formation of indurated and permanent swelling of the lip that not only compromises esthetic appearance but also causes impairment in function such as speaking and eating. Early diagnosis of OFG is challenging to the health care professionals due to clinical and histological resemblance to other chronic granulomatous disorders. Thus, dentists may act as a first person to diagnose the lesion and play an important role in the multidisciplinary treatment of granulomatous disorders. Here, we present a case of OFG affecting lips and gingiva in a 15-year-old patient without any identifiable systemic or local causes.",

The aim of the present study was to review the research on the effectiveness of e-therapy for eating disorders, using the methodology employed by the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Electronic databases were searched for published randomised controlled trials of e-therapies, designed to prevent or treat any eating disorder in all age groups. Studies were meta-analysed where possible, and effect sizes with confidence intervals were calculated. The GRADE approach was used to determine the confidence in the effect estimates. Twenty trials met the inclusion criteria. For prevention, a CBT-based e-intervention was associated with small reductions in eating disorder psychopathology, weight concern and drive for thinness, with moderate confidence in the effect estimates. For treatment and relapse prevention, various e-therapies showed some beneficial effects, but for most outcomes, evidence came from single studies and confidence in the effect estimates was low. Overall, although some positive findings were identified, the value of e-therapy for eating disorders must be viewed as uncertain. Further research, with improved methods, is needed to establish the effectiveness of e-therapy for people with eating disorders. \u2022 Systematic review of e-therapy for eating disorders was conducted using NICE methods. \u2022 Twenty randomised controlled trials were included, of which 14 were meta-analysed. \u2022 Small effects were found for CBT-based preventive e-interventions. \u2022 For treatment and relapse prevention there were fewer effects and of lower quality. \u2022 The value of e-therapy for eating disorders is uncertain.

The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of walking exercise in order to provide a method for overcoming bulimia nervosa in obese young women suffering from bulimia nervosa. Twenty obese women with bulimia nervosa (body mass index [BMI] >30 ) and a mean age of 22.00\u00b11.50 years volunteered to participate in this study. They were randomly assigned to exercise (n=10) and control (n=10) groups. Both groups underwent anthropometric measurements and blood analysis before and after the training program. Exercise program included 30-minute walking sessions at 50\u201375% of maximal heart rate, 3 days per week and for 2 months. After 2 months significant changes were observed in all anthropometric variables ( P <0.001). Percent body fat, fat mass, BMI, body weight and lean mass changes in response to training were significant in the exercise group ( P< 0.001). This study demonstrated that moderate aerobic exercises such as moderate walking are suitable behavior therapies for overcoming bulimia nervosa in obese young women.",

This paper reports DNA markers associated with eating quality of temperate japonica rice and an evaluation method aided by multiple regression analysis. A total of 30 markers comprising STSs, SNPs, and SSRs were tested for their association with palatability using 22 temperate japonica varieties with different palatability values. Eating quality-related traits of the 22 varieties were also measured. Of the 30 markers, 18 were found to be significantly associated with palatability and, consequently, a model regression equation with an R 2 value of 0.99 was formulated to estimate the palatability by the marker data set. Validation of the model equation using selected breeding lines indicated that the marker set and the equation are highly applicable to evaluation of the palatability of cooked rice in temperate japonica varieties.",

Enteral nutrition (EN) is a beneficial support that could help to maintain nutritional status and gut function. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of moderately high-protein enteral formula containing fibre on nutritional status, and its safety. A total of 23 tube-feeding-dependent adult patients were included in this multicentre, open-label study. The patients were fed with the study formula for 7\u201312 days or equal to the required nutritional support period, during which we performed physical examinations and assessed nutritional status. The primary endpoint was the statistical difference in nutritional status after the treatment, and the secondary outcome was the desirable safety profile. A significant improvement in cumulative energy balance after intervention was observed ( p = 0.008). However, the differences in nutritional status, weight and BMI before and after the intervention do not reach statistical significance. Retinol-binding protein (RBP), a marker for nutritional status, increased from baseline levels. Few cases of diarrhoea and constipation had been reported during the study as a safety concern. This study investigated the efficacy and safety of an enteral feed formulation containing fibre. The patients were nourished with the studied formulation via tube feeding for a short period without serious adverse events. After the intervention, the significant increase in cumulative energy balance was observed. However, an extended period of the intervention may be required to attain the significance in other indicators for nutritional status.",

    "abstract": "Psychiatric comorbidity is common in eating disorders (EDs) and associated with poor outcomes, including increased risk for relapse and premature death. Yet little is known about comorbidity following ED recovery. We examined two common comorbidities, major depressive disorder (MDD) and substance use disorder (SUD), in adult women with intake diagnoses of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa who participated in a 22-year longitudinal study. One hundred and seventy-six of 228 surviving participants (77.2%) were interviewed 22 years after study entry using the Eating Disorders Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation to assess ED recovery status. Sixty-four percent (n = 113) were recovered from their ED. The Structured ClinicalInterview for DSM-IV was used to assess MDD and SUD at 22 years. At 22-year follow-up, 28% (n = 49) met criteria for MDD, and 6% (n = 11) met criteria for SUD. Those who recovered from their ED were 2.17 times more likely not to have MDD at 22-year follow-up (95% CI [1.10, 4.26], p = .023) and 5.33 times more likely not to have a SUD at 22-year follow-up than those who had not recovered from their ED (95% CI [1.36, 20.90], p = .008). Compared to those who had not fully recovered from their ED, those who had recovered were twice as likely not to be diagnosed with MDD in the past year and five times as likely not to be diagnosed with SUDs in the past year. These findings provide evidence that long-term recovery from EDs is associated with recovery from or absence of these common major comorbidities. Because comorbidity in EDs can predict poor outcomes, including greater risk for relapse and premature death, our findings of reduced risk for psychiatric comorbidity following recovery at long-term follow-up is cause for optimism.",

Working women in India constitute a dominant and expanding pool of mothers. There is paucity of research focused on feeding behavior within this group. One hundred and fifty working women answered a structured questionnaire about their demographics, birth history, levels of awareness and practice of feeding guidelines, and perceptions about breastfeeding and counseling. Data analysis was carried out using Microsoft Excel and the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. Majority of participants belonged to 21-39 years age group, had nuclear families, received college education, and delivered in institutional setups. Gaps were observed between the mother\u2019s levels of awareness and practice for different tenets of national guidelines. Higher education, longer maternity leave, higher income, and utilization of counseling services facilitated adoption of optimal feeding behavior. Most women perceived breast milk to be superior to any alternative and favored provision of counseling during last trimester. Counseling women on optimal feeding behavior is a potential intervention to convert its awareness into actual practice. The lessons learned from this study can help refine both national and global Mother and Child Health policies and programs.",

    "abstract": "Breastfeed4Ghana was a social media-based campaign implemented to address identified gaps in the protection, promotion, and support of breastfeeding in Ghana. This paper describes the process of campaign materials development and testing to ensure their cultural and content appropriateness. The 60 campaign materials, each consisting of an image and text message, underwent a process of creation, testing, revision, and finalization. Existing research evidence and infant and young child feeding communication tools that were culturally relevant for Ghana were used to develop the materials. All materials were tested and finalized through an iterative process that incorporated input from six focus group discussions (FGDs) with mothers, and content and technical experts. The materials were revised to ensure scientific accuracy, understandability, and cultural appropriateness of the messages, as well as alignment of the messages with the images. Finalized materials were reviewed and approved by the Ghana Food and Drugs Authority. Analysis for this paper involved summarizing and categorizing the types and sources of input as well as the research team\u2019s responses to the input received. The 60 campaign materials received a total of 132 inputs. Most inputs came from FGDs (78.4%); and most inputs were on the campaign material images. The evidence-informed process of materials creation, use of multiple input sources, and a broad-based iterative process allowed the creation of 60 evidence-based and culturally appropriate materials for a breastfeeding social media campaign in Ghana. This paper could serve as a guide for other social media campaign efforts looking to develop culturally appropriate materials.",

Nasogastric/nasoenteral tube feeding is often complicated by diarrhea but the contribution of feeding strategy to the etiology is unclear. Twelve healthy adult male participants who underwent nasogastric intubation before a baseline MRI scan, received 400\u200amL of Resource Energy (Nestle) as a bolus over 5 minutes or continuously over 4\u200ahours via pump in this randomized crossover study. Changes in gastric volume, small bowel water content, and superior mesenteric artery blood flow and velocity were measured over 4\u200ahours using MRI and blood glucose and plasma concentrations of insulin, peptide YY, and ghrelin were assayed every 30 minutes. Bolus nasogastric feeding led to significant elevations in gastric volume ( P <\u200a0.0001), superior mesenteric artery blood flow ( P <\u200a0.0001), and velocity ( P =\u200a0.0011) compared with continuous feeding. Both types of feeding reduced small bowel water content, although there was an increase in small bowel water content with bolus feeding after 90 minutes ( P <\u200a0.0068). Similarly, both types of feeding led to a fall in plasma ghrelin concentration although this fall was greater with bolus feeding ( P <\u200a0.0001). Bolus feeding also led to an increase in concentrations of insulin ( P =\u200a0.0024) and peptide YY ( P <\u200a0.0001), not seen with continuous feeding. Continuous nasogastric feeding does not increase small bowel water content, thus fluid flux within the small bowel is not a major contributor to the etiology of tube feeding-related diarrhea.",

Cross-sectional observational health facility assessment. Ethiopia, Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, Rwanda and Tanzania. Health workers in 643 facilities. 1016 health workers were interviewed, and 2377 babies were observed in the facilities surveyed. Indicators of quality of newborn care included (1) provision of immediate essential newborn care: thermal care, hygienic cord care, and early and exclusive initiation of breast feeding; (2) actual and simulated resuscitation of asphyxiated newborn infants; and (3) knowledge of health workers on essential newborn care, including resuscitation. Sterile or clean cord cutting instruments, suction devices, and tables or firm surfaces for resuscitation were commonly available. 80% of newborns were immediately dried after birth and received clean cord care in most of the studied facilities. In all countries assessed, major deficiencies exist for essential newborn care supplies and equipment, as well as for health worker knowledge and performance of key routine newborn care practices, particularly for immediate skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding initiation. Of newborns who did not cry at birth, 89% either recovered on their own or through active steps taken by the provider through resuscitation with initial stimulation and/or ventilation. 11% of newborns died. Assessment of simulated resuscitation using a NeoNatalie anatomic model showed that less than a third of providers were able to demonstrate ventilation skills correctly. The findings shared in this paper call attention to the critical need to improve health facility readiness to provide quality newborn care services and to ensure that service providers have the necessary equipment, supplies, knowledge and skills that are critical to save newborn lives.",

In this work, we presented a case that spontaneous venous thrombosis in main draining veins of an unruptured AVM were confirmed, and reviewed the relevant literature in order to discuss the possible mechanisms. Clinical data and treatment of a 33-year-old man with a preliminary diagnosis as right parietal mass with secondary epilepsy. The diagnosis of the mass was a right parietal arteriovenous malformation (AVM) that was 3.5\u200acm in size and supplied mainly by multiple feeders of right middle cerebral artery (MCA). An operation was performed with meticulous hemostasis of the extracranial soft tissue and the AVM was resected completely. The patient's neurological deficits improved postoperatively and he was subsequently discharged 1 week after surgery. Thrombosis of the draining veins may be due to venous stagnation. Spontaneous venous thrombosis in an unruptured AVM is rare. Spontaneous obliteration of an AVM can occur by 2 mechanisms: occlusion of the feeding arteries or of the draining veins. Surgical or interventional treatment of an unruptured AVM with thrombosed draining veins is highly controversial now. However, we favor an aggressive treatment strategy.",

All of the tumors were studied with CEUS before TACE using a second-generation ultrasound contrast agent (SonoVue\u00ae, Bracco, Milan, Italy). The tumor response to TACE was classified with a score between 1 and 4 according to the remaining enhancing-tumor percentage based on modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (mRECIST): 1, enhancing tumor <25%; 2, 25%\u2264enhancing tumor<50%; 3, 50%\u2264enhancing tumor<75%; and 4, enhancing tumor\u226575%). A score of 1 was defined as a \"good response\" to TACE. The predictive factors for the response to TACE were evaluated during CEUS based on the maximum tumor diameter, initial arterial enhancing time, arterial enhancing duration, intensity of arterial enhancement, presence of a hypoenhanced pattern, and the feeding artery to the tumor. The median tumor size was 3.1 cm. The distribution of tumor response scores after TACE in all tumors was as follows: 1, n=11; 2, n=4; 3, n=2; and 4, n=1. Fifteen tumors showed feeding arteries. The presence of a feeding artery and the tumor size (\u22645 cm) were the predictive factors for a good response ( P =0.043 and P =0.047, respectively).

This qualitative study used data from 151 mothers from questionnaires with open\u2010ended questions and telephone interviews.

In the organizing theme \u201cgenuine support strengthens,\u201d the mothers described how they were strengthened by being listened to and met with respect, understanding, and knowledge. The support was individually adapted and included both practical and emotional support. In the organizing theme \u201cinadequate support diminishes,\u201d the mothers described how health professionals who were controlling and intrusive diminished them and how the support they needed was not provided or was inappropriate. Thus, the global theme \u201cbeing thrown into a lottery\u2014dependent on the health professional who provided breastfeeding support\u201d emerged, meaning that the support received was random in terms of knowledge and support style, depending on the individual health professionals who were available.

Tissue samples of stranded animals were collected (n = 60), and 700 bp mitochondrial DNA sequences were generated and compared to shorter sequences from previously published studies. Global exact tests of differentiation revealed significant differences among PEC and the other FGs, except those at the South Atlantic Ocean. Green turtles at PEC present genetic signatures similar to those of nesting females from Ascension Island, Guinea Bissau and Aves Island/Surinam. Population expansion was evidenced to have occurred 20\u201325 kYA, reinforcing the hypothesis of recovery from Southern Atlantic refugia after the last Glacial Maximum.

This study investigated the effects of mindful and slow eating strategies on acute EI and satiety. Twenty\u2010four participants were randomized to one of three eating conditions (EAT, MIND, SLOW). For the EAT condition, participants were instructed to eat as they normally would for both test meal sessions. For the SLOW condition, participants were instructed to eat as they normally would for their first test meal session and to slow their eating for the second test meal session. For the MIND condition, participants were instructed to eat as they normally would during their first test meal session and were given brief instructions on mindful eating for their second test meal session. For each condition, participants were provided ad libitum access to a test meal, and EI was calculated based upon food consumed. Participants rated their level of satiety following each meal. There were no significant differences in EI between eating strategy conditions. There was a trend towards a decrease in energy intake in the MIND condition compared with the EAT condition and a prevention of increased intake in the SLOW condition. There were no significant differences in ratings of satiety between conditions. Although, neither mindful nor slow eating strategies significantly decreased acute EI or satiety; the results suggest that both strategies blunted the increase in EI observed in EAT that occurred across two eating episodes, which may suggest that these strategies can be important for modifying eating behaviour that may contribute to body weight regulation. Additional appropriately designed studies investigating these strategies appear warranted to confirm these findings.",

As a result of the increased subcutaneous tissue accumulation, lipedema is often confused with obesity by both physicians and patients. Poor awareness and limited diagnosis of lipedema contribute to the confusion of lipedema with obesity and can lead to decreased body image acceptance. Patients with lipedema may have anorexia nervosa, an eating disorder characterized by a distortion of body image, incorrect self-identification of being overweight, restricted eating behavior, and a relentless pursuit of weight loss. A young woman with disproportionate fat accumulation on the lower half of her body self-identified as having obesity. She developed restrictive eating behavior and became obsessed with weight loss, resulting in anorexia nervosa. Her disproportionate subcutaneous tissue persisted despite losing weight to reach a nadir BMI of 15 kg/m 2 . After a decade-long struggle, her eating disorder resolved, and she maintained a healthy weight and BMI of 21.5 kg/m 2 but disproportionate fat remained in her lower body. She experienced increasing leg tenderness, pain, and easy bruising and was diagnosed with lipedema. Lack of recognition of lipedema by medical professionals and the public as a weight loss-resistant disease can affect body image acceptance. Lipedema was mistaken for obesity by the young woman in this case and likely played a role in her development of an eating disorder. Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa, are not rare and may be more common in women with lipedema.",

    "abstract": "The negative effects of cesarean section on breastfeeding are a major global concern. This study aimed to determine the effect of Oketani breast massage on the maternal need for support during breastfeeding, breastfeeding success, and breastfeeding self-efficacy. Three hospitals affiliated to Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences in Tehran, Iran, from April to July 2019. The participants in this experimental study were 113 pregnant women who were candidates for cesarean section. The mothers were selected using convenience sampling and randomly assigned. In addition to routine care, the mothers in the intervention group received Oketani breast massages twice. However, the mothers in the control group received routine care. The data were collected using the Infant Breastfeeding Assessment Tool (IBFAT), LATCH Assessment Score, and the Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale (BSES). The data were analyzed with SPSS 20 software via the independent samples t test, the Mann\u2013Whitney U test, and the chi-square test. The results of the study suggested that the breastfeeding success rate, which was evaluated with IBFAT in both the first two breastfeeding stages and the last pre-discharge breastfeeding, was significantly higher for the mothers in the intervention group ( p < .001). In addition, the mother\u2019s need for support, which was evaluated with LATCH in the first two breastfeeding stages ( p = .044) and the last pre-discharge breastfeeding ( p < .001) in the intervention group, was less. The total number of breastfeeding sessions from birth to discharge was higher in the intervention group ( p = .002). Furthermore, the mothers in the intervention group breastfed their infants in a significantly shorter time interval ( p = .002). Breastfeeding self-efficacy, according to the BSES, was significantly higher in the mothers of the intervention group ( p < .001). Oketani massage can be used as a care intervention by nurses to improve breastfeeding in mothers who undergo cesarean sections.",

    "abstract": "Broiler breeders are commonly feed restricted using some variation of skip-a-day feeding to prevent excessive body weight (BW) gain and poor flock uniformity that results in lower production levels. However, the level of feed restriction has increased leading to negative effects on broiler breeder welfare. Research needs to be conducted to evaluate alternative feeding programs to diminish the negative impact of restricted feeding on bird welfare. This research examined pullets that were fed soybean hulls (alternate day feeding, ATD) on the off day of a traditional skip-a-day feeding program in comparison to the standard skip-a-day program (SAD). The 2 dietary feeding treatments each had 3 replicate pens of 210 pullets each and were fed from wk 5 to 21 of age. Nitrogen-corrected true metabolizable energy and digestible amino acid coefficients of soybean hulls were determined. Body weight in the ATD feed program was significantly higher ( P < 0.001) than the birds on the SAD feed program until 16 wk of age. Feed allocations for the SAD feeding program was increased at 11 wk of age to achieve similar BW prior to photo stimulation. The ATD feed program significantly improved BW uniformity of the birds for weeks 8, 12, 16, and 20. Hens fed on the SAD feed program had a lower mean egg production than the hens fed on the ATD program. There were significant differences on plasma corticosterone concentrations between the feeding days (24 or 48 h after feeding) in both feed programs. There was a shift in the behavior of the birds with significant differences in the feeding, foraging, and comfort behaviors between the feeding programs on the same feed day. Overall, feeding the ATD females soybean hulls on the off feed day improved the BW uniformity and egg production, but further research will be needed to determine potential differences in nutrient utilization or behavior of the pullets that positively impacted this flock performance.",

    "abstract": "Eating behavior is determined by a balance of memories in terms of reward and punishment to satisfy the urge to consume food. Refilling empty energy stores and hedonistic motivation are rewarding aspects of eating. Overfeeding, associated adverse GI effects, and obesity implicate punishment. In the current review, evidence is given for the hypothesis that bariatric surgery affects control over eating behavior.Moreover, any caloric overload will reduce the feeling of satiety. Durable weight loss after bariatric surgery is probably the result of a new equilibrium between reward and punishment, together with a better signaling of satiation due to beneficial metabolic changes.We propose to introduce three main treatment goals for bariatric surgery: 1) acceptable weight loss, 2) improvement of eating control, and 3) metabolic benefit. To achieve this goal, loss of 50% to 70% of excess weight will be appropriate (i.e. 30% to 40% loss of initial weight), depending on the degree of obesity prior to operation.",

A survey was conducted in 670 middle-aged subjects (320 men and 350 women) aged 40\u201364 years, resided in Seoul and Gyeonggi area. Collected data were analyzed using SPSS WIN 25.0 program. Perceived stress in middle-aged subjects was not different by sex. Stress was higher in men with low dietary habits level compared to other groups ( P < 0.001), and was higher in women with low and moderate dietary habits level compared to women with high dietary habits level ( P < 0.05). Stress in men was higher in the group with emotional eaters ( P < 0.05), and the same result was shown in women ( P < 0.001). Stress was higher in both men and women with poor sleep quality ( P < 0.001). Stress score was positively correlated with emotional dietary behavior and insomnia ( P < 0.001) and negatively correlated with dietary habits ( P < 0.001).

The aim of this study is to compare the effects of early inhomecare (PreHomeCare) including video consultations and mobile applications with those of inhospital consultations regarding breast feeding, parental confidence and parent\u2013infant interactions. A randomised controlled intervention study will be conducted in four neonatal departments offering PreHomeCare (ie, premature infant inhomecare) in Denmark. Parents of hospitalised premature infants who fulfil the inclusion criteria for PreHomeCare will be randomised during hospitalisation to either the intervention (n=80) or control group (n=80) using 1:1 block randomisation. During PreHomeCare, the intervention group will receive a smartphone application with a video system and an infant scale, and the control group will receive usual care (ie, hospital consultations). Additionally, both groups will have planned nurse consultations two to three times a week: the intervention group through video consultations and the control group through inhospital consultations. Data collection will occur at inclusion/baseline, at the end of PreHomeCare and 1\u2005month after discharge using questionnaires and hospital records. The primary outcome is the proportion of exclusively breastfed infants 1\u2005month after discharge/end of PreHomeCare, the secondary outcomes are parent\u2013infant interactions measured by the Mother and baby interaction scale and family confidence in caring for infants measured by the Karitane Parenting Confidence Scale. The process evaluation will consist of two qualitative studies: a field study and an interview study. Data collection will initially involve field observations of three scheduled video consultations with six families from the intervention group. These families will also be interviewed 1\u2005month after PreHomeCare has ended. The project has been approved by the Regional Ethics Committee and the Danish Data Protection Agency. NCT02581800.",

    "abstract": "Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most common serious, acquired gastrointestinal disorder in the newborn infant. Although many variables are associated with development of NEC, only prematurity has been consistently identified in case-controlled studies. Traditionally, the diving seal reflex has been invoked as the mechanism responsible for ischaemic injury and necrosis. Intestinal ischaemia is likely to be the final common pathway in NEC; however, it is due to the release of vasoconstricting substances, such as platelet activating factor, rather than perinatal asphyxia. Bacteria and/or bacterial toxins are likely to have a key role in the pathogenesis of NEC by fostering production of inflammatory mediators. The role of feeding practices in the pathogenesis of NEC remains controversial. Treatment of infants with NEC generally includes a regimen of bowel rest, gastric decompression, systemic antibiotics and parenteral nutrition. Infants with perforation are generally operated upon; however, there has been recent interest in primary peritoneal drainage as an alternative. Prevention of NEC still remains elusive. Avoidance of preterm birth, use of antenatal steroids and breast-milk feeding are practices that offer the greatest potential benefits. Use of any other strategy should await further trials.",

In respect of eating disorders, in the 1950s a new line of study about the neurological bases of anorexia nervosa was started and has since been developed. The purpose of this review is to update the existing literature data on the main findings in respect of EEG in eating disorders by means of a search conducted in PubMed. Despite the fact that weight gain tends to normalize some brain dysfunctions assessed by means of EEG, the specific effect of gaining weight remains controversial. Different studies have reported that cortical dysfunctions can be found in patients with anorexia nervosa even after weight gain, whereas others have reported a normalization of EEG in respect of the initial reduced alpha/ increased beta power in those patients with refeeding. Findings of studies that have analyzed the possible relationship between eating disorders and depression, based on sleep EEG disturbances, do not support the idea of eating disorders as a variant of depression or affective disorders. Some EEG findings are very consistent with previous neuroimaging results on patients with anorexia nervosa, reporting neural disturbances in response to stimuli that are relevant to the pathology (eg, stimuli like food exposure, different emotional situations, or body images).",

Women were compared on the studied outcomes using logistic regression. We performed crude and adjusted analyses (adjusting for relevant confounding factors). Fertility treatment, twin births, unplanned pregnancies, and women's feelings towards unplanned pregnancies. Relative to women without psychiatric disorders, women with bulimia nervosa had increased odds (odds ratio, OR, 2.3; 95% confidence interval, 95% CI, 1.1\u20135.2) of having undergone fertility treatment. Women with all eating disorders had increased odds of twin births (anorexia nervosa, OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.0\u20137.7; bulimia nervosa, OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.1\u20136.6; anorexia and bulimia nervosa, OR 3.795% CI 1.3\u201310.7).

In addition to the public health threat, this invasive species may also be an ecological threat for native container-breeding mosquitoes which share a similar larval habitat. Therefore, it is of importance to gain knowledge on ecological and eco-toxicological features of the Asian bush mosquito. However, optimal laboratory feeding conditions have not yet been established. Standardized feeding methods will be needed in assessing the impact of insecticides or competitional strength of this species. To fill this gap, we performed experiments on food quality and quantity for Ae. j. japonicus larvae. We found out that the commercial fish food TetraMin (Tetra, Melle, Germany) in a dose of 10\u2009mg per larva is the most suitable food tested.

A descriptive study with a qualitative approach was developed in the city of Guarulhos (Southeast Brazil). Key informants from municipal public schools were interviewed. Public schools were selected (n=13) and classified as to the level of social exclusion, size and economic activity of the region where the school was located. Pedagogic coordinators and school principals were individually interviewed with semi-structured questions. From school principals and pedagogical coordinators' perceptions, three categories were identified: Food in the school context; School feeding program's role and the Concept of food and nutrition security, which indicate that they considered meals as part of school routine in order to attain physiological needs of energy and nutrients. Their answers also indicated that they did not consider school meals as a pedagogical action related to their specific responsibilities. The relationship between the school feeding and the formation of eating habits is not a topic usually discussed between the different professionals involved with health and education. The implementation of health promoting policies will only be possible after a debate about how schools and their pedagogical team adopt the program guidelines and how the professionals decode these strategies in daily activities.

A community based cross sectional study was conducted from January to February 2016 in ( 8 ) randomly selected kebles found in Bensa District. Respondents were selected by using simple random sampling technique after sampling frame was prepared from rapid survey. Pre-tested questionnaire was used to collect information. Then, data were entered into SPSS version 20, Then, crude odds ratio (COR) and adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% confidence interval were computed to examine statistical significance. This study revealed that only 8.6% (95%CI: 6.4, 10.7%) of 6\u201323 months children had optimal complementary feeding practices. Mother's knowledge on optimal complementary feeding (AOR=5.4, 95%CI: 2.7, 11), postnatal care service utilization (AOR=3.4, 95%CI: 1.7, 7), and household food security (AOR=5, 95%CI: 2.5, 10.5) were positively associated with optimal complementary feeding practices. Mother's knowledge, postnatal care utilization and household food security positively affected optimal complementary feeding practices.

    "abstract": "Background We assessed the influence of season of birth on duration of breastfeeding and other feeding patterns in three population-based birth cohort studies in the city of Pelotas, Southern Brazil. Methods In 1982, 1993 and 2004, all hospital-born children in the city were enrolled in three cohort studies ( n =\u20095914, 5249 and 4287, respectively). Children and their mothers were periodically visited in the first 2 years of life, to collect information on the duration of breastfeeding and the ages at which different types of foods were introduced on a regular basis. Two independent variables were studied: month of birth and mean environmental temperature in the first month of life. Survival analyses and chi-squared tests were used to evaluate the associations. Temperature-based slope indices of inequality were also calculated. Results Duration of breastfeeding was lower among children born from April to June (months preceding winter) and spending their first month of life in colder temperatures. The influence of season of birth on breastfeeding patterns and the introduction of cow's milk differed according to maternal education, with the strongest effects among children belonging to less educated mothers. Early introduction of fruits (1982 and 1993 cohorts) and vegetables (1982 cohort) were also associated with lower environmental temperature in the first month of life, but not with trimester of birth. Conclusion Colder temperatures adversely affect duration of breastfeeding and feeding patterns in infancy, especially among the poorest. This finding should be considered in breastfeeding promotion programmes.",

The benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and mother is well documented; therefore, the information about the risk\u2013benefit of antidepressants, if used while mothers are breastfeeding, is necessary for the clinician\u2019s decision. The case series and systematic data on antidepressants in breastfeeding consist mainly of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin\u2013norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and mirtazapine, whereas information on newer antidepressants such as agomelatine in pregnant or lactating women is rare, especially the adverse effects on the infant of the mother with PPD treated with agomelatine. To add to the limited available data, we report the case of agomelatine treatment in a breastfeeding woman with PPD. In this case report, we took advantage of the short half-life of agomelatine to reduce the potential effect on infant in the treatment of a nursing woman with PPD. The results confirm the effectiveness of agomelatine in the treatment of PPD and demonstrate the safety in breastfeeding.",

Evidence-based treatments like cognitive\u2013behavioural therapy (CBT) might be poorly accessible, and about 50% of those who receive CBT respond to it.

    "abstract": "Breastfeeding has numerous advantages. Our aim was to investigate whether breastfeeding initiation and duration in women with pregnancies conceived through in vitro fertilisation differ from spontaneously conceived pregnancies. This is a comparative cross\u2010sectional study about breastfeeding behaviour performed at the Bern University Hospital including mothers of singletons conceived by in vitro fertilisation (n\u00a0=\u00a0198) with or without gonadotropin stimulation between 2010 and 2016 (in vitro fertilisation group). They were compared to a population\u2010based control group (n\u00a0=\u00a01421) of a randomly selected sample of mothers in Switzerland who delivered in 2014. A total of 1619 women were included in this analysis. Breastfeeding initiation rates were high, similar between the in vitro fertilisation group (93.4%) and the control group (94.8%). No increased risk of stopping breastfeeding earlier after in vitro fertilisation treatment compared to the control group could be found over the observational period of 12\u00a0months (HR\u00a0=\u00a01.00, 95% CI 0.83\u20101.20, P =\u00a0.984). There was no difference in breastfeeding initiation or duration after gonadotropin\u2010stimulated vs unstimulated in vitro fertilisation. In Switzerland, in vitro fertilisation treatments were not associated with earlier breastfeeding cessation. This result is reassuring for mothers undergoing in vitro fertilisation.",

This study was carried out on 2,434 persons (1,736 women and 698 men) aged between 19 and 64 years. A questionnaire form was used as a data collection tool, which consisted of items for the socio-demographic characteristics, anthropometric measurements, Emotional Appetite Questionnaire (EMAQ), and the Palatable Eating Motives Scale (PEMS). A positive significant correlation was observed between the BMI groups and the negative emotions, negative situations, and negative total scores of EMAQ ( P < 0.01). The regression results on negative subscales showed that a one unit increase in BMI resulted in a 0.293 unit increase in negative situations scores, a 0.626 unit increase in negative emotions scores, and a 0.919 unit increase in negative total EMAQ scores. When the BMI groups and PEMS subscale scores were examined, a significant relationship was found in the social motives, rewarding, and conformity subscales ( P < 0.01). A one unit increase in BMI increased the coping motives scores by 0.077 units. The emotional states have a significant effect on the eating behavior. On the other hand, an increase in eating attacks was observed, particularly in people who were under the effect of a negative emotion or situation. Nevertheless, there were some limitations of the study in terms of quantitative determination of the effects of this eating behavior depending on the BMI.",

    "abstract": "Infection of implants is a major problem in elective and trauma surgery. Heating is an effective way to reduce the bacterial load in food preparation, and studies on hyperthermia treatment for cancer have shown that it is possible to heat metal objects with pulsed electromagnetic fields selectively (PEMF), also known as induction heating. We therefore set out to answer the following research question: is non-contact induction heating of metallic implants effective in reducing bacterial load in vitro ? Titanium alloy cylinders (Ti6Al4V) were exposed to PEMF from an induction heater with maximum 2000 watts at 27 kHz after being contaminated with five different types of micro-organisms: Staphylococcus epidermidis; Staphylococcus aureus; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ; spore-forming Bacillus cereus; and yeast Candida albicans . The cylinders were exposed to incremental target temperatures (35\u00b0C, 45\u00b0C, 50\u00b0C, 55\u00b0C, 60\u00b0C, 65\u00b0C, 70\u00b0C) for up to 3.5 minutes. There was an average linear heating rate of 0.39\u00b0C per second up to the target temperature, and thereafter the target temperature was maintained until the end of the experiment. At 60\u00b0C and higher (duration 3.5 minutes), there was a 6-log reduction or higher for every micro-organism tested. At 60\u00b0C, we found that the shortest duration of effective induction heating was 1.5 minutes. This resulted in a 5-log reduction or higher for every micro-organism tested. Non-contact induction heating of a titanium disk is effective in reducing bacterial load in vitro . These promising results can be further explored as a new treatment modality for infections of metal orthopaedic implants. Cite this article : B. G. Pijls, I. M. J. G. Sanders, E. J. Kuijper, R. G. H.

    "abstract": "The health benefits of breastfeeding are well known. However, some ill babies including those admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) cannot be directly breastfed. In this situation, expressed breast milk (EBM) can be used. However, breast milk is not always sterile and may be contaminated by many microorganisms. EBM contamination is probably attributed to improper technical and hygienic factors and may pose significant threats to the newborn baby. The present study aimed to document the prevalence of EBM contamination in NICU and to uncover the relevant risk factors. The study included 118 mothers who could express breast milk for their own neonates admitted to the NICU. A checklist was used to document the steps the mothers followed during expression of milk and all steps of handling until the EBM reached the NICU. A 1 mL sample of EBM was obtained and sent to the microbiology laboratory within 20 minutes. Data obtained from the present study are expressed as number and percentage or mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD). Statistical calculations were computed using SPSS 25. In the present study, 106 (89.8%) out of the assessed 118 EBM samples were contaminated. Hygienic factors related to EBM contamination included hand only wash, possible recontamination of hands during turning taps off, lack of using cotton pads or cloth piece on nipple and breast cleaning by water only. Other factors related to EBM contamination included container cleaning by water only, fresh milk refrigeration after > 4 hours, adding freshly expressed warm breast milk to refrigerated milk expressed earlier in the same day, milk transport in plastic bags with ice packs and longer transportation time. In the contaminated samples, the most commonly isolated organisms included Staphylococcus aureus (55.7%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (21.7%) and Enterobacter (11.6%). The present study identified bacterial contamination in about 90% of EBM samples delivered to NICU infants. Factors related to EBM contamination include hygienic, storage and transport factors.",

The present manuscript has the following aims: (1) to analyse the psychometric properties of the COVID Isolation Eating Scale (CIES), (2) to explore changes that occurred due to confinement in eating symptomatology; and (3) to explore the general acceptation of the use of telemedicine during confinement. The sample comprised 121 participants (87 ED patients and 34 patients with obesity) recruited from six different centres. Confirmatory Factor Analyses (CFA) tested the rational\u2010theoretical structure of the CIES. Adequate goodness\u2010of\u2010fit was obtained for the confirmatory factor analysis, and Cronbach alpha values ranged from good to excellent. Regarding the effects of confinement, positive and negative impacts of the confinement depends of the eating disorder subtype. Patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) and with obesity endorsed a positive response to treatment during confinement, no significant changes were found in bulimia nervosa (BN) patients, whereas Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder (OSFED) patients endorsed an increase in eating symptomatology and in psychopathology. Furthermore, AN patients expressed the greatest dissatisfaction and accommodation difficulty with remote therapy when compared with the previously provided face\u2010to\u2010face therapy. The present study provides empirical evidence on the psychometric robustness of the CIES tool and shows that a negative confinement impact was associated with ED subtype, whereas OSFED patients showed the highest impairment in eating symptomatology and in psychopathology.",

    "abstract": "To determine patterns of satiety responsiveness and its relationship to eating in the absence of hunger (EAH), in a cohort of adolescents. We also assessed whether sex, BMI and duration of breastfeeding, during infancy, predicted satiety responsiveness and eating behavior at 16 years. Adolescents (n=576) from a longitudinal cohort, that began as an iron deficiency anemia preventive trial, participated in an unlimited breakfast after an overnight fast, and reported satiety response on a visual analogue scale after the meal, followed by an EAH procedure. Height, weight and body composition were measured before breakfast. Latent profile analysis generated profiles that captured individual differences in satiety responsiveness. Multivariable regressions, adjusted for potential confounders, evaluated the association between: 1) satiety responsiveness and EAH, and 2) breastfeeding in infancy, satiety responsiveness and EAH in adolescence. Participants were on average 16.7-years-old, 48% female, 37% overweight/obese and 76% were breastfed as the sole source of milk for < 6 months. We found three latent profiles of satiety responsiveness: 1. \u201cresponsive\u201d (49%); 2. \u201cnot responsive\u201d (41%); 3. \u201cstill hungry\u201d (10%). Participants in the \u201cnot responsive\u201d or \u201cstill hungry\u201d profile were more likely to eat during the EAH procedure (OR=2.5, 95%CI 1.8\u20133.6).

Satiety responsiveness was not influenced by sex and overweight/obesity. After an ad libitum meal, we found varied satiety responses, which related to EAH. Furthermore, shorter breastfeeding duration was associated with poorer satiety response and higher consumption during an EAH procedure. Understanding if breastfeeding influences the development of satiety responsiveness and eating behavior may be important in an era characterized by abundant calorie-dense foods and a plethora of environmental cues promoting consumption.",

    "abstract": "A perception of insufficient milk supply (PIMS) is associated with early discontinuation of breastfeeding. Ideally, an objective measure of milk supply would either dispel or confirm this perception and provide reassurance or guide professional advice. Clinical signs of sufficient milk intake (steady growth, sufficient elimination, infant alertness and breasts feeling full before breastfeeds and soft after breastfeeds) should provide confidence in milk supply. We surveyed 423 mothers in early lactation who had breastfeeding problems to determine the proportion that had PIMS and to determine if the mothers with PIMS relied on these clinical signs or other perceptions of their infants' behaviour as indications of insufficient milk supply. By 3 weeks after birth, we found that the rate of PIMS among mothers with breastfeeding problems was 44%. Supplementary infant formula was being given to 66% of the infants, so the clinical indications were that milk intake was sufficient, but 74% of the mothers with PIMS cited concerns that their infants did not appear satisfied after breastfeeds. After targeted advice from lactation consultants, mothers with PIMS showed positive changes in their perceptions of their milk supply, underlining the value of professional guidance soon after birth. We conclude that an appearance of infant dissatisfaction is the major cause of PIMS in Western Australia.",

    "abstract": "Longer-term feeding studies suggest that a low-carbohydrate diet increases energy expenditure, consistent with the carbohydrate-insulin model of obesity. However, the validity of methodology utilized in these studies, involving doubly labeled water (DLW), has been questioned. The aim of this study was to determine whether dietary energy requirement for weight-loss maintenance is higher on a low- compared with high-carbohydrate diet. The study reports secondary outcomes from a feeding study in which the primary outcome was total energy expenditure (TEE). After attaining a mean Run-in weight loss of 10.5%, 164 adults (BMI\u00a0\u226525 kg/m 2 ; 70.1% women) were randomly assigned to Low-Carbohydrate (percentage of total energy from carbohydrate, fat, protein: 20/60/20), Moderate-Carbohydrate (40/40/20), or High-Carbohydrate (60/20/20) Test diets for 20 wk. Calorie content was adjusted to maintain individual body weight within \u00b1\u00a02\u00a0kg of the postweight-loss value. In analyses by intention-to-treat (ITT, completers, n =\u00a0148) and per protocol (PP, completers also achieving weight-loss maintenance, n =\u00a0110), we compared the estimated energy requirement (EER) from 10 to 20 wk of the Test diets using ANCOVA. Mean EER was higher in the Low- versus High-Carbohydrate group in models of varying covariate structure involving ITT [ranging from 181 (95% CI: 8\u2013353) to 246 (64\u2013427) kcal/d; P \u22640.04] and PP [ranging from 245 (43\u2013446) to 323 (122\u2013525) kcal/d; P \u22640.02]. This difference remained significant in sensitivity analyses accounting for change in adiposity and possible nonadherence. Energy requirement was higher on a low- versus high-carbohydrate diet during weight-loss maintenance in adults, commensurate with TEE. These data are consistent with the carbohydrate-insulin model and lend qualified support for the validity of the DLW method with diets varying in macronutrient composition.

    "abstract": "Humans and animals exposed to undernutrition (UN) during development often experience accelerated \u201ccatch-up\u201d growth when food supplies are plentiful. Little is known about the mechanisms regulating early growth rates. We previously reported that actions of leptin and presynaptic inputs to orexigenic NPY/AgRP/GABA (NAG) neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus are almost exclusively excitatory during the lactation period, since neuronal and humoral inhibitory systems do not develop until after weaning. Moreover, we identified a critical step that regulates the maturation of electrophysiological responses of NAG neurons at weaning \u2013 the onset of genes encoding ATP-dependent potassium (K ATP ) channel subunits. We explored the possibility that UN promotes subsequent catch-up growth, in part, by delaying the maturation of negative feedback systems to neuronal circuits driving food intake. We used the large litter (LL) size model to study the impacts of postnatal UN followed by catch-up growth. We evaluated the maturation of presynaptic and postsynaptic inhibitory systems in NAG neurons using a combination of electrophysiological and molecular criteria, in conjunction with leptin's ability to suppress fasting-induced hyperphagia. The onset of K ATP channel subunit expression and function, the switch in leptin's effect on NAG neurons, the ingrowth of inhibitory inputs to NAG neurons, and the development of homeostatic feedback to feeding circuits were delayed in LL offspring relative to controls. The development of functional K ATP channels and the establishment of leptin-mediated suppression of food intake in the peri-weaning period were tightly linked and were not initiated until growth and adiposity of LL offspring caught up to controls.

    "abstract": "Animals dramatically modify their chemosensory behaviors when starved, which could allow them to alter and optimize their food-search strategies. Dynamic changes in the gene expression of chemoreceptors may be a general mechanism underlying food and state-dependent changes in chemosensory behaviors. In our recent study, 1 we identified chemoreceptors in the ADL sensory neuron type of C. elegans that are modulated by feeding state and food availability. Here, we highllight our recent findings by which sensory inputs into ADL, neuronal outputs from ADL, and circuit inputs from the RMG interneuron, which is electrically connected to ADL, are required to regulate an ADL-expressed chemoreceptor. This sensory and circuit-mediated regulation of chemoreceptor gene expression is dependent on cell-autonomous pathways acting in ADL, e.g. KIN-29, DAF-2, OCR-2 and calcium signaling, and circuit inputs from RMG mediated by NPR-1. Based on these findings, we propose an intriguing but speculative feedback modulatory circuit mechanism by which sensory perception of food and internal state signals may be coupled to regulate ADL-expressed chemoreceptors, which may allow animals to precisely regulate and fine-tune their chemosensory neuron responses as a function of feeding state.",

Using UK Millennium Cohort Study data ( n = 10,126 children, born 2000\u20132002), we examined the association between breastfeeding duration and wheezing in the previous year, first for each age group separately (ages 9 months, 3 years, 5 years, 7 years, and 11 years) and then in terms of a longitudinal wheezing phenotype: \u201cearly transient\u201d (wheezing any time up to age 5 years but not thereafter), \u201clate onset\u201d (any time from age 7 years but not beforehand), and \u201cpersistent\u201d (any time up to age 5 years and any time from age 7 years). The association between breastfeeding and wheeze varied by age (2-sided P for interaction = 0.0003). For example, breastfeeding for 6\u20139 months was associated with lower odds of wheezing at ages 9 months, 3 years, and 5 years but less so at ages 7 years and 11 years (adjusted odds ratios = 0.73, 0.78, 0.79, 0.84, 1.06, respectively). There was a strong dose-response relationship for breastfeeding per month and early transient wheeze (adjusted odds ratio for linear trend = 0.961, 95% confidence interval: 0.942, 0.980) but no clear trend for late-onset or persistent wheeze. Our results identified heterogeneity in the association between breastfeeding and wheezing according to age at wheezing and wheezing phenotype.",

    "abstract": "Goose fatty liver is one of the most delicious and popular foods in the world, but there is no reliable genetic marker for the early selection and breeding of geese with good liver-producing potential. In our study, one hundred and twenty-four 78-day-old Landes geese bred in Shunda Landes goose breeding farm, Jiutai, Jilin, China were selected randomly. The fatty livers were sampled each week after overfeeding during a three week period. Polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing were used to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of fatty acid synthase (FAS), which is an important enzyme involved in the synthesis of fat under both physiological and pathological conditions. Least-squares correlation was established between these SNPs and fatty liver weight, abdominal fat weight, and intestinal fat weight of the overfed Landes geese, respectively. The results showed that fatty liver weight of geese with EF and FF genotypes (amplified by primer P1) was significantly higher than that of the EE genotype (p<0.05), and liver weight of CD and DD genotypes (amplified by primer P2) was significantly higher than that of the CC genotype (p<0.05). Different genotype combinations showed different liver weights, and from highest to lowest were ABDD, DDEF, DDFF, DDEE, ABEF, ABFF, AADD, and CDEF. Further analysis of DNA sequencing showed that there were two SNPs within the 5\u2032 promoter region the FAS gene. The geese of EF and FF genotypes carried a change of T to C, and the geese of CD and DD genotypes carried a change of A to G. The changes of the bases could potentially influence the binding of some transcription factors to this region as to regulate FAS gene. To our knowledge, this is the first report of SNPs found within the 5\u2032 promoter region of the Landes goose FAS gene, and our data will provide an insight for early selection of geese for liver production.",

The aim of our research was to analyze nutritional behaviors for the assessment of the risk of orthorexia. The authors developed a questionnaire in which 981 respondents participated and used it as a research method. Both men and women ate mostly 4\u20135 meals per day (46.30% women versus 34.74% men); however, more men than women ate 1\u20132 meals daily (18.95% men versus 7.9% women). Both place of birth and field of study did not differ in terms of the number of meals. Moreover, it was observed that the number of meals per day was correlated with the declared time spent on planning a diet. People who ate over 3 meals per day more often indicates that they spent >3 h per day on planning their diet in comparison with people who ate only 1\u20132 meals. Only 17.6% of the respondents declared that they most often ate meals in a company of someone, whereas 45.3% indicated that there was no rule. The remaining 37.1% of the respondents most often consumed their meals alone. Almost twice as many men as women never paid attention to the qualitative composition of nutrition. Women followed a slimming diet more often than men (20.3% versus 5.8%) and this indicated >4 attempts of losing weight. Around one-third of all the respondents suffered or suffer from eating disorders. Owing to insufficient information on orthorexia, it is essential to conduct further research to determine the characteristics of high-risk groups. Taking the growing interest in a healthy lifestyle into account, there is a need to address the problem of orthorexia in the public space.",

In contrast some other studies have reported not important decline in cognition and executive function as a result of fasting. Also limited attention was generally devoted to dietetic regimens, nutritional status and body weight. Yet neuroscience and neuro-cognitive aspects of acute hunger on the electroencephalogram and differences between obese and non-obese cases is not well understood. Hence, we decided to design and perform a case study in a more controlled situation similar to reality. Therefore, we performed several examinations including subjective tests (for eating status) and objective tests (cognitive tests such as Stroop effect and Sternberg search and electroencephalogram measures such as steady-state visual evoked potential and auditory steady-state responses) for an obese and a non-obese academic case before and after a simple breakfast. The results showed that the breakfast effects on the neuro-cognitive functions depend on either obesity status, nutritional status of the case or the type of cognitive task (visual or auditory). This paper would open a new insight to answer some important questions about the neuro-cognitive implications of fasting and feeding in obese and non-obese human cases.",

However, the circumstances that may influence the effectiveness of the interventions are unclear, especially in the context of hospitals with suboptimal infant feeding practices. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the effect of a self-efficacy intervention on breastfeeding self-efficacy and exclusive breastfeeding, and further assessed the difference in its effect by hospital-routine type. In this intervention study with a control group, 781 pregnant women were recruited from 2 \u201cBaby-Friendly\u201d-certified hospitals (BFH) and 2 non-Baby-Friendly Hospitals (nBFH) in Japan, and were allocated to an intervention or control group. Participants in the intervention group were provided with a breastfeeding self-efficacy workbook in their third trimester. The primary outcome was breastfeeding self-efficacy and the secondary outcome was infant feeding status. All analyses were stratified by the type of hospital, BFH or nBFH. In BFHs, the intervention improved both breastfeeding self-efficacy through 4\u00a0weeks postpartum ( p =\u00a00.037) and the exclusive breastfeeding rate at 4\u00a0weeks postpartum (AOR 2.32, 95\u00a0% CI 1.01\u20135.33). In nBFHs, however, no positive effect was observed on breastfeeding self-efficacy ( p =\u2009\u00a00.982) or on the exclusive breastfeeding rate at 4\u00a0weeks postpartum (AOR 0.97, 95\u00a0% CI 0.52\u20131.81); in nBFHs, supplementation was provided for breastfed infants and the mother and infant were separated in the vast majority of cases. Infant feeding status at 12\u00a0weeks was not improved in either hospital type. The intervention improved breastfeeding self-efficacy and exclusive breastfeeding at 4\u00a0weeks postpartum only in BFHs.

The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of peripheral injection of GHRH on feeding behavior in chicks ( Gallus gallus ).

The IP injection of GHRH47 did not induced any abnormal behavior, suggesting that GHRH47-induced anorexia might not be related to abnormal behavior such as sleeping, hyperactivity and convulsion. The anorexigenic effect of GHRH47 seemed not to be related to GH because IP injection of bovine GH did not affect feeding behavior in chicks.

In recent years, psychiatrists have paid more attention to topiramate as a mood stabilizer and as an agent for treating eating disorders, especially in binge eating disorder (BED) and bulimia nervosa. Herein, we report a case of topiramate precipitating a manic episode in a bipolar patient comorbid with BED, who complained of emotional instability and binge-eating behaviors. In this patient, acute manic episode was induced by topiramate treatment at a daily dose of 75\u200amg for three days. The dose of topiramate was decreased to 25\u200amg per day promptly, and the patient gradually became calm but the BED symptoms recurred, then the dose of topiramate was increased to 50\u200amg per day again. Meanwhile, the dosage of quetiapine was escalated up to 500\u200amg per night to stabilize her mood. With a combination of quetiapine 500\u200amg per night and topiramate 50\u200amg per day, the emotion and eating problems of this patient concurrently improved. These findings indicated that patients with a history of bipolar disorder and comorbid BED have a tendency to develop manic episode when taking topiramate. Careful monitoring of mood alterations after topiramate supplement to mood stabilizers is necessary in this population.",

A 32-item questionnaire was administered to a convenience sample of N = 60 women, working at a regional healthcare facility in the Pacific Northwest. Descriptive statistics characterized PA and healthy eating, barriers and support for PA and healthy eating, and perceived role of technology for health promotion. Chi-square tests for categorical variables evaluated relationships between PA and healthy eating support with behavioral engagement. Only 23% and 25% followed recommended PA and fruit and vegetable consumption guidelines. Those likely to engage in preventive care had higher income and education. Fewer respondents reported barriers to PA than for healthy eating (47% vs. 57%), and those reporting barriers were likely to have lower income and less than a high-school education. Sixty percent reported social support for PA and only 52% for healthy eating. A significant relationship was evident between PA support and PA engagement ( P = 0.015). Eighty-two percent used mobile phones to look up health information and 29% did so daily.

    "abstract": "A modifiable factor related to breastfeeding is breastfeeding attitudes. The Iowa Infant Feeding Attitude Scale (IIFAS) is used to evaluate this factor. Although the breastfeeding rates in Greece are declined there is not available any validated instrument to evaluate infant feeding attitudes. to determine the psychometric properties of the Greek adaptation of the IIFAS in a sample of pregnant women. Pregnant women (N=203) from a University Hospital in Athens, Greece, were administered the Greek version of the IIFAS, while being in hospital, and their infant feeding mode at six months postpartum was recorded by telephone. The reliability of the scale was assessed by using corrected item-total correlations and Cronbach\u2019s alpha. Construct validity of the scale was assessed by using confirmatory factor analysis and predictive validity by using t-tests. Multiple linear regression analyses in a stepwise method (p for removal was set at 0.1 and p for entry was set at .05) was performed in order to find variables independently associated with IIFAS total score. The mean IIFAS score was 70.0 (SD=7.6). The corrected item-total correlation ranged from 0.22 to 0.51. Cronbach\u2019s alpha was equal to 0.71. The confirmatory factor analysis indicated an adequate fit of the one-factor model. Concerning the predictive validity of IIFAS it was significant for breastfeeding at six months. The mean IIFAS score was significantly greater (p=0.001) for women that had exclusive breastfeeding at six months (mean (SD): 68.4(6.6)) as compared with those that did not (mean (SD): 64.0(7.5)). Higher IIFAS scores were found in older women, with higher educational level and in those that had breastfed children in their social environment. The Greek version of the IIFAS demonstrated satisfying reliability and validity for measuring women\u2019s infant feeding attitudes in the Greek context. Also, the results of the present study provide further evidence of the international applicability of the IIFAS.",

    "abstract": "Postpartum period in women is vulnerable to the occurrence and exacerbation of psychiatric disorders. Mothers with postpartum psychosis or bipolar disorder need treatment with psychotropic medications, especially atypical antipsychotics. However, many mothers and families will have reservations about the use of psychotropics during the perinatal period, particularly during breastfeeding because of its presumed side effects and adverse developmental outcomes of the child. Since there are limited data in this area, the present study aimed to examine the adverse effects, if any, and the short-term developmental outcome of infants exposed to atypical antipsychotics during breastfeeding. The study involved infants of postpartum women ( n = 28) who were admitted in the mother and baby inpatient psychiatry unit of a tertiary care center in India. The medication side effects were checked every alternate day for 1\u20132 weeks using a checklist based on common side effects that infants may experience due to lactation exposure of atypical antipsychotics. Developmental assessments of the infants were done using the Developmental Assessment Scales for Indian Infants and through anthropometric measurements such as weight, length, head circumference, and chest circumference in follow-up when they came as an outpatient after 1\u20133 month interval. The occurrence of adverse side effects was quite low (17.85%). The main side effects directly attributable to atypical antipsychotics were constipation and sedation. Of the 17 infants who attended follow-up, 52.9% ( n = 9) showed some form of developmental delay at the time of the first follow-up. However, low birth weight, higher maternal age (>35 years), and exposure to medications (quetiapine and phenytoin) during pregnancy may be confounding risk factors. The acute adverse effects of atypical antipsychotics such as sedation and constipation in the infant through breast milk were seen in less than a fourth of the sample. Developmental delay was noted in a proportion of infants; however, this may be due to other risk factors.",

    "abstract": "As smartphones are widely distributed nowadays, mental health apps seem to be a promising treatment tool. First self-help apps for eating disorders have been developed recently. However, studies assessing the efficacy of such apps are scarce. A smartphone app could prevent further weight reduction and increase commitment during waiting time for outpatient treatment, especially for adolescents with anorexia nervosa (AN). In this study protocol, a randomised controlled trial to assess the efficacy of a smartphone-enhanced low-threshold intervention for AN during waiting time is described. 30 adolescents with AN aged 12\u201319 years will be recruited at three child and adolescent psychiatry centres in Germany. All participants will be randomised to consultations only or consultations and the use of the Jourvie Research app. The app will be installed either on their own smartphone or on a research device. The participants will receive biweekly to monthly consultations for 3 months to review meal plans and weight management with a clinician. In addition, the Jourvie Research app for meal, behaviour and emotion protocolling will be provided to the intervention group. The protocols will be discussed with a clinician during the consultations. Dialectical behaviour therapy-informed skills for tension regulation to increase compliance with the meal plan will be taught in the intervention group and the app will remind the participant of a skill in a moment of need. The primary outcome is the age-adjusted and height-adjusted weight gain in standard deviation score after 3 months. Results will be disseminated at conferences and through peer-reviewed publications. The trial was approved by the ethics review board of the local medical association, Mainz, Germany, under the reference number 837.338.15.

    "abstract": "Impairments in metabolic flexibility and substrate handling are associated with metabolic syndrome. However, it is unknown whether metabolic inflexibility causes insulin resistance. We therefore measured metabolic flexibility and substrate handling before and after 8 weeks of overfeeding in initially healthy adults, as a model of the early stages of insulin resistance. Twenty-nine healthy men (27 \u00b1 5 years old; BMI 25.5 \u00b1 2.3 kg/m 2 ) were overfed by 40% above baseline energy requirements for 8 weeks and gained 7.6 \u00b1 2.1 kg of weight. Before and after overfeeding, energy expenditure, substrate oxidation, and metabolic flexibility were measured in 2 ways: a) during 1 day of eucaloric feeding in a whole-room indirect calorimeter, and b) during a two-step hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Eight weeks of overfeeding decreased insulin sensitivity at low and high doses of insulin (p=0.001 and p=0.06, respectively). This was accompanied by decreases in the respiratory quotient (RQ) while sleeping (0.877 \u00b1 0.020 to 0.864 \u00b1 0.026; p=0.05) and at low insulin levels during the clamp (0.927 \u00b1 0.047 to 0.907 \u00b1 0.032; p=0.01). Overfeeding did not affect metabolic flexibility as measured during a clamp (p\u22650.17), but it tended to increase 24-hour metabolic flexibility (awake \u2013 sleep RQ) as measured by chamber by 0.010 \u00b1 0.028 (p=0.08). In terms of substrate oxidation, overfeeding increased protein oxidation (13 \u00b1 23 g/day; p=0.003) and tended to increase fat oxidation (6 \u00b1 16 g/day; p=0.07), but did not affect carbohydrate oxidation (p=0.64). Individuals with greater metabolic adaptation to overfeeding had higher carbohydrate oxidation rates (r=0.66, p=8\u00d710 \u22125 ) but not fat oxidation rates (p=0.09). The early stages of insulin resistance are accompanied by modest declines in the RQs during sleep and during a clamp, with no changes in fasting RQ or signs of metabolic inflexibility. Our data therefore suggest that metabolic inflexibility does not cause insulin resistance.",

This population-based study used claims data from Taiwan\u2019s National Health Insurance Research database between 2001 and 2012. The study involved 1270 participants. These included 254 depressed individuals with ED and 1016 propensity score-matched depressed individuals without ED. We tracked each patient for a 1\u2009year period to evaluate their healthcare service utilisation, including outpatient visits, inpatient days, and costs for psychiatry and non-psychiatry services. We performed a Mann-Whitney U test to compare outcome variables in healthcare service utilisation between the two groups. Patients with both depression and ED had significantly more outpatient visits (32.2 vs 28.9, p=0.023), outpatient costs (US$1089 vs US$877, p<0.001) and total costs (US$1356 vs US$1296, p<0.001) than comparison patients. For psychiatric services, patients with depression and ED had more outpatient visits (11.0 vs 6.8, p<0.001), outpatient costs (US$584 vs US$320, p<0.001) and total costs (US$657 vs US$568, p<0.001) than those without ED. For non-psychiatric services, there was no significant difference for all utilisation. This indicates that the total costs were about 1.0-fold greater for depression patient with ED than those without ED. Depression patients with ED had more outpatient visits, outpatient costs and total costs of healthcare services than those without ED.",

In experiment 1, the differences in maximum tongue pressure (TP) and cheek pressure (CP) at the measurement time point for both groups with and without training were examined. We instructed subjects to perform gum chewing training 3 times daily for 3 months. TP and CP were measured before training and at 1, 2, and 3 months after starting training. In experiment 2, the changes of TP and CP based on the sex and duration of training were examined. The effect of the training was evaluated before training, at 2 weeks and 1, 2, and 3 months after starting training, and at 1 and 3 months after cessation of training. Experiment 1 showed TP and CP increased with the progress of continuous training. In experiment 2, TP and CP were higher in men than in women and markedly increased at 2 weeks and 1 month in both sexes. After cessation of training, TP and CP tended to decrease, but there was no significant difference between 3 months after starting training, and also significantly higher than before training. This study suggested that gum chewing training is a useful to improve the swallowing and feeding function.",

    "abstract": "The term \u2018hedonic hunger\u2019 refers to one's preoccupation with and desire to consume foods for the purposes of pleasure and in the absence of physical hunger. The Power of Food Scale (PFS) was developed as a quantitative measure of this construct in 2009. Since then, over 50 published studies have used the PFS to predict appetite\u2010related outcomes including neural, cognitive, behavioural, anthropometric and clinical measures. This narrative review evaluates how closely the PFS captures the construct it was originally presumed to assess and to more clearly define hedonic hunger itself. The measure's relationship to four domains is reviewed and summarized: motivation to consume palatable foods; level of actual consumption of such foods; body mass; and subjective loss\u2010of\u2010control over one's eating behaviour. Findings are synthesized to generate a more accurate understanding of what the PFS measures and how it may relate to the broader definition of hedonic hunger. Results suggest that the PFS is closely related to motivation to consume palatable foods and, in extreme cases, occurrence of loss\u2010of\u2010control eating episodes. PFS scores are not consistently predictive of amount of food consumed or body mass. Implications of these findings are discussed in the context of behavioural health, and avenues for further inquiry are identified.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the pooled prevalence and determinants of prelacteal feeding in Eastern Africa. This study was carried out within 11 East African countries from 2010 to 2018, a pooled study of prelacteal feeding was performed. For assessing model fitness and contrast, intra-class correlation coefficient, median odds ratio, proportional change in variance, and deviance were used. In order to identify possible covariates associated with prelacteal feeding in the study area, the multilevel multivariable logistic regression model was adapted. Adjusted Odds Ratio was used with 95% confidence interval to declare major prelacteal factors. The pooled prevalence of prelacteal feeding in Eastern Africa was 12% (95% CI: 11.42\u201312.53%), with the highest prevalence of prelacteal feeding in the Comoros (39%) and the lowest in Malawi (3%).

In East Africa, the magnitude of prelacteal feeding was still high. The possible determinants of prelacteal feeding in Eastern Africa were wealth index, birth interval, delivery mode, place of delivery, ANC visit, and community ANC visit.

Data issued from muscle biopsies suggested blunted anabolic mechanisms in free\u2010living state. Weight and metabolic responses to protein caloric supplementation has not been yet explored in CT. A 2 week overfeeding (additional 600 kcal, 30 g protein, 72 g carbohydrate, and 21 g fat) was performed to compare two groups of CTs (12 women and 11 men) to normal\u2010weight controls (12 women and 10 men). Bodyweight, food intake, energy expenditure, body composition, nitrogen balance, appetite hormones profiles, and urine metabolome were monitored before and after overfeeding. Before overfeeding, positive energy gap was found in both CT genders (309 \u00b1 370 kcal in CT\u2010F and 332 \u00b1 709 kcal in CT\u2010M) associated with higher relative protein intake per kilo (1.74 \u00b1 0.32 g/kg/day in CT\u2010F vs. 1.16 \u00b1 0.23 in C\u2010F, P < 0.0001; 1.56 \u00b1 0.36 in CT\u2010M vs. 1.22 \u00b1 0.32 in C\u2010M, P = 0.03), lower nitrogen (7.26 \u00b1 2.36 g/day in CT\u2010F vs. 11.41 \u00b1 3.64 in C\u2010F, P = 0.003; 9.70 \u00b1 3.85 in CT\u2010M vs. 14.14 \u00b1 4.19 in C\u2010M, P = 0.02), but higher essential amino acids urinary excretion (CT/C fold change of 1.13 for leucine and 1.14 for arginine) in free\u2010living conditions. After overfeeding, CTs presented an accentuated positive energy gap, still higher than in controls (675 \u00b1 540 in CTs vs. 379 \u00b1 427 in C, P = 0.04). Increase in lean mass was induced in both controls genders but not in CTs (a trend was noticed in CT women), despite a similar nitrogen balance after overfeeding (5.06 \u00b1 4.33 g/day in CTs vs. 4.28 \u00b1 3.15 in controls, P = 0.49). Higher anorectic gut hormones' tone, glucagon\u2010like peptide 1 and peptide tyrosine tyrosine, during test meal and higher snacking frequency were noticed before and after overfeeding in CTs. The blunted muscle energy mechanism, previously described in CTs in free\u2010living state, is associated with basal saturated protein turn over suggested by the concordance of positive nitrogen balance and an increased urine excretion of several essential amino acids. This saturation cannot be overpassed by increasing this spontaneous high\u2010protein intake suggesting a resistance to lean mass gain in CT phenotype.",

Difficulties with feeding require specialized attention, and if not well managed, may prolong the newborn's hospital length of stay. This is particularly true for prenatally opioid exposed (POE) infants. A paucity of literature exists characterizing feeding behaviors of POE infants, yet feeding problems are common. The purpose of this integrative review was to synthesize and critically analyze the evidence that characterizes feeding behaviors in full-term, POE infants. The electronic databases of CINAHL, PubMed, Scopus, and PsycINFO were used. Inclusion criteria were studies in English, conducted from 1970 to 2019, with participant samples consisting of infants with prenatal opioid exposure, born full-term, and between 38 and 40 weeks of gestation. Based on the inclusion criteria, our search yielded 557 articles. After further screening, only 4 studies met our full inclusion/exclusion criteria. These studies were analyzed for evidence of infant feeding behaviors, including characterization of problematic feeding behavior for POE infants. Our findings revealed inconsistencies in characterization of feeding behaviors among POE infants. A synthesis of the most common evidence-based behaviors was constructed. Infant feeding behaviors were identified and grouped into 2 major behavior domains: (1) typical feeding behavior and (2) problematic feeding behavior. Feeding behaviors related to sucking and behavioral states may be different in POE infants. Further examination of effective assessment methods and the categorization of infant feeding behaviors are warranted for use in the development of evidence-based, targeted intervention.",

    "abstract": "the aim of this longitudinal study was to evaluate the impact of COVID\u201019 epidemic on Eating Disorders (EDs) patients, considering the role of pre\u2010existing vulnerabilities. 74 patients with Anorexia Nervosa (AN) or Bulimia Nervosa (BN) and 97 healthy controls (HCs) were evaluated before lockdown (T1) and during lockdown (T2). Patients were also evaluated at the beginning of treatment (T0). Questionnaires were collected to assess psychopathology, childhood trauma, attachment style, and COVID\u201019\u2010related post\u2010traumatic symptoms. A different trend between patients and HCs was observed only for pathological eating behaviors. Patients experienced increased compensatory exercise during lockdown; BN patients also exacerbated binge eating. Lockdown interfered with treatment outcomes: the descending trend of ED\u2010specific psychopathology was interrupted during the epidemic in BN patients. Previously remitted patients showed re\u2010exacerbation of binge eating after lockdown. Household arguments and fear for the safety of loved ones predicted increased symptoms during the lockdown. BN patients reported more severe COVID\u201019\u2010related post\u2010traumatic symptomatology than AN and HCs, and these symptoms were predicted by childhood trauma and insecure attachment. COVID\u201019 epidemic significantly impacted on EDs, both in terms of post\u2010traumatic symptomatology and interference with the recovery process. Individuals with early trauma or insecure attachment were particularly vulnerable.",

    "abstract": "Computational fluid dynamics demonstrates that the Precambrian organism Tribrachidium was likely a passive suspension feeder. The first diverse and morphologically complex macroscopic communities appear in the late Ediacaran period, 575 to 541 million years ago (Ma). The enigmatic organisms that make up these communities are thought to have formed simple ecosystems characterized by a narrow range of feeding modes, with most restricted to the passive absorption of organic particles (osmotrophy). We test between competing feeding models for the iconic Ediacaran organism Tribrachidium heraldicum using computational fluid dynamics. We show that the external morphology of Tribrachidium passively directs water flow toward the apex of the organism and generates low-velocity eddies above apical \u201cpits.\u201d These patterns of fluid flow are inconsistent with osmotrophy and instead support the interpretation of Tribrachidium as a passive suspension feeder. This finding provides the oldest empirical evidence for suspension feeding at 555 to 550 Ma, ~10 million years before the Cambrian explosion, and demonstrates that Ediacaran organisms formed more complex ecosystems in the latest Precambrian, involving a larger number of ecological guilds, than currently appreciated.",

    "abstract": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SAR-CoV-2) has been shown to invade brain tissue. Based on the evolutionary similarity with SARS-CoV, researchers propose that SARS-CoV-2 can invade the olfactory bulb and gastrointestinal (GI) system through angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. However, how SARS-CoV-2 causes neurological or GI symptoms is not clear. Many suggested intestinal and neural inflammations, caused by viral invasion, as the most likely reason for the GI and neurological symptoms; however, the patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) without neurological or GI symptoms indicate that this is not the case. The gut-brain axis could explain the reason for why some with COVID-19 do not have these symptoms. COVID-19 patients mostly show respiratory distress first, then diarrhea, anorexia, stroke, or loss of consciousness comes into view. Obviously, GI invasion is a mechanical process that begins with oral invasion and, therefore, most probably exists before the brain invasion, as indicated in case reports. However, when the GI tract is invaded, the virus may enter the central nervous system through vascular and lymphatic systems or the vagal nerve. SARS-CoV-2 can infect leukocytes and migrate with them into the brain, or the viral particles can be directly transported across the blood-brain barrier to the brain. Also, more recent research has revealed that SARS-CoV-2 can invade the peripheral lymphatic vessels connecting with the glymphatic system of the brain. The temporal correlation between neurological and gastrointestinal symptoms suggests the lymph vessels around the GI tract, the vascular system, or the gut-brain axis (enteric nervous system) as the most likely entry route for SARS-CoV-2 to the brain.",

Fathers influence complementary feeding practices, and effective strategies are needed to engage them. The objectives of this research were to examine the acceptability and feasibility of (1) tailored complementary feeding recommendations and (2) engaging fathers in complementary feeding. We conducted trials of improved practices with 50 mothers and 40 fathers with children 6\u201318\u00a0months. At visit 1, mothers reported current feeding practices and fathers participated in focus group discussions. At visit 2, mothers and fathers received individual, tailored counselling and chose new practices to try. After 2\u00a0weeks, at visit 3, parents were interviewed individually about their experiences. Interview transcripts were analysed thematically. The most frequent feeding issues at visit 1 were the need to thicken porridge, increase dietary diversity, replace sugary snacks and drinks and feed responsively. After counselling, most mothers agreed to try practices to improve diets and fathers agreed to provide informational and instrumental support for complementary feeding, but few agreed to try feeding the child. At follow\u2010up, mothers reported improved child feeding and confirmed fathers' reports of increased involvement. Most fathers purchased or provided funds for recommended foods; some helped with domestic tasks or fed children. Many participants reported improved spousal communication and cooperation. Families were able to practice recommendations to feed family foods, but high food costs and seasonal unavailability were challenges. It was feasible and acceptable to engage fathers in complementary feeding, but additional strategies are needed to address economic and environmental barriers.",

    "abstract": "This study was to investigate weaning practices used by mothers when transitioning infants from breast milk to complementary foods and to determine the role these foods have in the transmission of gastrointestinal parasites. On average, of the 175 mothers extensively interviewed, 93% said they had breast-fed their infants. Approximately 20.8% of mothers had added some other liquid to their infant\u2019s diet at 3 months, while most mothers had added other liquids at 6 months (39.0%) and >6 months (32.1%). Some mothers expanded food offerings to infants before 3 months. The percentage of mothers who had added other liquids to their infants\u2019 diet was reported by age of the infant: as early as 1 day (2.5%), <1 week (1.9%), first month (3.1%), 3 months (20.8%), 6 months (39.0%), and >6 months (32.1%). These foods included fruit, vegetables, meat, and grains. The maximum age a child was found to be still breastfeeding was 13 years. Forty percent of mothers involved in this survey reported that their children were diagnosed and/or treated for gastrointestinal parasitic infection. Routes of infection of protozoan and helminth parasites likely resulted from contaminated complementary foods and water given to infants while still breast-feeding or from contaminated foods after breast-feeding had been completed. Contaminated water is a likely source of protozoan parasites. Contaminated water was fed to infants, mixed with formula or complementary foods, or used to wash bottles for infant feeding. There was an absence of hand-washing by children and mothers before eating or while preparing foods. The major source of soil-transmitted helminth infections was likely the result of unwashed or uncooked pureed fruit or vegetables used as complementary foods, unpasteurized animal milk, insanitary food storage, poor living conditions with exposed dirt floors, and exposure to roaming domestic animals.",

Primary care provides a unique opportunity for delivery of infant feeding interventions for childhood obesity prevention. Implementation strategies are needed to support infant feeding intervention delivery. The Choosing Healthy Eating for Infant Health (CHErIsH) intervention is a complex infant feeding intervention delivered at infant vaccination visits, alongside a healthcare professional (HCP)-level implementation strategy to support delivery. This protocol provides a description of a non-randomised feasibility study of an infant feeding intervention and implementation strategy, with an embedded process evaluation and economic evaluation. Intervention participants will be parents of infants aged \u22646 weeks at recruitment, attending a participating HCP in a primary care practice. The intervention will be delivered at the infant\u2019s 2, 4, 6, 12 and 13\u2009month vaccination visits and involves brief verbal infant feeding messages and additional resources, including a leaflet, magnet, infant bib and sign-posting to an information website. The implementation strategy encompasses a local opinion leader, HCP training delivered prior to intervention delivery, electronic delivery prompts and additional resources, including a training manual, poster and support from the research team. An embedded mixed-methods process evaluation will examine the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention, the implementation strategy and study processes including data collection. Qualitative interviews will explore parent and HCP experiences and perspectives of delivery and receipt of the intervention and implementation strategy. Self-report surveys will examine fidelity of delivery and receipt, and acceptability, suitability and comprehensiveness of the intervention, implementation strategy and study processes. Data from electronic delivery prompts will also be collected to examine implementation of the intervention. A cost\u2013outcome description will be conducted to measure costs of the intervention and the implementation strategy. This study received approval from the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of the Cork Teaching Hospitals. Study findings will be disseminated via peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations.",

To evaluate in young adults whether intakes of specific foods are associated with \u2018food addiction\u2019, as assessed by the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS), and to describe the associated nutrient intake profiles. Australian adults aged 18\u201335\u00a0years were invited to complete an online cross-sectional survey including demographics, the YFAS and usual dietary intake. Participants were classified as food addicted (FAD) or non-addicted (NFA) according to the YFAS predefined scoring criteria. A total 462 participants (86% female, 73% normal weight) completed the survey, with 14.7% ( n =\u00a068) classified as FAD. The FAD group had a higher proportion of females ( p =\u00a0.01) and higher body mass index ( p <\u00a0.001) compared to NFA. Higher YFAS symptom scores were associated with higher percentage energy intake (%E) from energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods including candy, take out and baked sweet products, as well as lower %E from nutrient-dense core foods including whole-grain products and breakfast cereals. These remained statistically significant when adjusted for age, sex and BMI category ( p =\u00a0.001). Statistically significant associations were identified between YFAS assessed food addiction and dietary intake, specifically intakes of energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods. However, the effect sizes were small limiting clinical applications. Further examination of the relationship between addictive-like eating and intake of specific foods in a nationally representative sample is warranted. \u2022 14.7% participants met the YFAS predefined criteria for food addiction. \u2022 Those classified as food addicted had a significantly higher body mass index. \u2022 Higher symptom scores related to higher intakes of energy-dense nutrient-poor foods \u2022 Lower odds of YFAS assessed food addiction with higher intakes of whole-grains. \u2022 Higher odds of YFAS assessed food addiction with higher intakes of dietary fat. 14.7% participants met the YFAS predefined criteria for food addiction.

Evidence-based principles of the evaluation and treatment of musculoskeletal impairment used in physiotherapy practice were applied and adapted to manage pain experienced by mothers with breastfeeding. Subjects and Methods: This report describes 11 mothers referred to a breastfeeding clinic for pain with breastfeeding. Mothers were initially assessed by a physician and a nurse clinician, both International Board-Certified Lactation Consultants, to rule out causes of breast or nipple pain. When the cause remained unexplained, it was deemed musculoskeletal, and mothers were referred to a physiotherapist for assessment and treatment with manual orthopedic therapy and mobilization of the myofascial system. Results: The physiotherapist's objective musculoskeletal assessment and mothers' impression showed an improvement in the overall clinical picture after the first appointment in most mothers. Pain was resolved or alleviated by 80% in five mothers after 1\u20133 weekly treatments. The most useful therapeutic approach was to make afflicted mothers aware of their posture to maintain spinal alignment and avoid shear posture (lateral displacement of the trunk). Shear posture is a consequence of sitting leaning to one side. This posture is exacerbated by thoracic rotation and flexion, for example, when turning the trunk and bending over the baby while giving the breast. Conclusion: Treating musculoskeletal impairment referred pain to the breast or nipple with physiotherapy practices used in a nonbreastfeeding clientele can help alleviate or resolve pain with breastfeeding.",

This cross-sectional descriptive study of 396 mother and child pairs who attend the well child clinics of two tertiary hospitals in Enugu (Enugu state University Teaching Hospital and University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital) between September 2018 and February 2019. An interviewer administered, well-structured pro forma was used to collect data while mothers were observed closely as they breastfed and scored using the World Health Organization criteria. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 22. Most of the mothers studied (357; 90.2%) attended ante-natal care, and 365 (92.2%) of the deliveries were assisted by a health worker. Only 194 (49%) of mothers practiced good breastfeeding techniques. Maternal age (20\u201330 years) ( P < 0.001, odds ratio [OR] 0.464), attendance to antenatal clinic ( P < 0.001; OR 8.336), health education and demonstration on breastfeeding techniques before and after delivery ( P = 0.001) and maternal level of education (\u03c7 2 = 13.173, P = 0.001) but not parity ( P = 0.386; OR 1.192) were significantly associated with good breastfeeding techniques.

Information is limited on child and infant feeding recommendations within the World Health Organization (WHO) European Region. The WHO Regional Office for Europe and the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) performed a survey of national recommendations on infant and young child nutrition aimed at national government departments of health and national paediatric experts. Questions addressed national recommendations on breast-feeding and complementary feeding. Information was available from 48 of the 53 Member States. Forty-five of 48 countries (94%) have national recommendations on infant and young child feeding, of which 41 are endorsed by official public health authorities. Regarding introduction of complementary feeding, 25 countries (out of 34, 74%) recommend 6 months of age as the ideal age. The earliest age of introduction recommended varies from 4 to 5 months in (31/38 countries, 82%) to 6 months (6/38, 16%) and 7 months (1/38, 2.6%). The recommended meal composition varies widely; introduction of iron-rich foods (meat, fish, eggs) at the age of 6 months is recommended in 30 out of 43 countries, whereas 13 (30%) recommend later introduction. National infant feeding recommendations vary widely between studied countries and partly differ from international recommendations. Too early introduction of complementary feeding can reduce duration of exclusive breast-feeding (EBF). Too late introduction of iron-rich complementary foods might increase anemia risk and adversely affect child development. A review and further harmonization of national recommendations appears desirable.",

The objective was to assess the relationship between breastfeeding and adolescents\u2019 body composition. The HELENA study is a cross-sectional study involving 3,528 adolescents from 10 European cities. The outcome measures were body weight and height, subscapular skinfolds as well as waist circumferences. Breastfeeding, smoking status, and parental socioeconomic status were assessed by self-administered questionnaires. Dietary intake was recorded using two 24-hour recall surveys. Two adjustment approaches were used: i) covariance analysis adjusted for confounding factors (propensity score adjustment) and ii) multivariate quantile regression. After adjustment, no significant associations were observed between breastfeeding and body composition parameters (BMI Z-score; sum of skinfolds; waist-to-height ratio). An adjusted quantile regression analysis showed a non-significant trend for a protective effect of breastfeeding toward the highest percentiles of adiposity in boys but not in girls. This is of particular interest with respect to the superiority of the waist-to-height ratio over waist circumference and BMI for detecting cardiometabolic risk factors.

This task is a nursing duty and vital to ensure that they do this safely.

This quantitative study was undertaken to determine the efficacy of a clinical pharmacist educational program for improving nurses\u2019 knowledge, attitudes, and practice (KAP) concerning administrating medication via feeding tubes. This case\u2013control study was performed to evaluate KAP of intensive-care nurses with regard to drug delivery through enteral feeding tubes before and after their training program. A questionnaire focusing on nurses\u2019 KAP was prepared by a clinical pharmacist and reviewed by 18 nurses for its reliability. Then, an educational program was designed for the case group. Two months later, nurses\u2019 KAP in the case and control groups were reevaluated. Nurses\u2019 practice regarding drug administration through feeding tube was observed three times. This study was carried out with 82 nurses working in six intensive-care units in two major training hospitals in Shiraz, Iran. The overall knowledge of nurses increased significantly after the training program in the case group, with adequate awareness regarding solid dosage\u2013form crushing increasing from 14% to 63.2% ( P \u02c20.001), tube flushing and drug dilution from 32.6% to 81.6% ( P \u02c20.001), and knowledge about mixing crushed drugs through a feeding tube from 23.3% to 55.3% ( P \u02c20.001). On the contrary, there was no change in the control group. After intervention, nurses\u2019 attitudes in the case group had changed significantly, and 50% of them consulted with pharmacists regarding drug administration. An in-service education program by clinical pharmacists can lead to substantial improvements in administration of drugs via enteral feeding tubes.",

    "abstract": "Facing poor long-term outcome and high relapse rates in the treatment of bulimia nervosa, we developed an Internet-based aftercare program for women with severe and chronic bulimia nervosa following inpatient treatment based on previous experiences with self-directed targeted prevention and early intervention programs delivered online. The aim of the present study was to examine adherence to the program in detail, to explore potential variables that predict adherence and to analyze whether adherence affects outcomes. We analyzed data from 126 women in the intervention group of a randomized controlled trial. 107 women (85%) logged on to the program platform at least once. These women opened on average 42.8% (SD\u202f=\u202f31.9%) of all assigned program pages. Adherence declined during the course of the intervention. Adherence was not associated with the number of outpatient treatment sessions received during the intervention period. Adherence was not related to overall illness severity or duration at baseline. However, excessive exercise at hospital discharge (which may be a sign of insufficient motivation to change eating disorder related behaviors) seems to play some small role in adherence. Adherence did not affect intervention outcomes. Based on our findings, we would like to advocate further research on online aftercare interventions for women with severe and chronic bulimia nervosa. \u2022 We examined adherence to an online aftercare program for women with bulimia nervosa following inpatient treatment. \u2022 Adherence was unrelated to overall illness severity or duration at baseline. \u2022 Adherence was unrelated to concurrent outpatient treatment. \u2022 Adherence did not affect intervention outcomes.

    "abstract": "The microalga biomass production from confectionary effluent is a possible solution for the urgent need for a live food in aquaculture. Arthrospira ( Spirulina ) platensis was the dominant alga in effluent of \u201cBiscomisr a confectionary factory\u201d, in Alexandria\u2013Egypt. Therefore, it was isolated from the effluent samples and used throughout the study. The cyanobacterium, A. platensis was grown on the effluent using 2 2 Central Composite Design (2 2 CCD). This work addresses the best effluent dilution (WC, %) as well as sodium bicarbonate concentration (SBC) on the alga growth and biochemical composition. Total protein, carbohydrate, lipid contents and fatty acid profiles of the produced algal biomass were highly improved. The statistical analyses suggested that the main effect of (WC, %) is significant negative influences on the algal contents of proteins, lipids and carbohydrates ( p >\u00a00.01). Although it had a significant positive influence on chlorophyll ( p >\u00a00.01), no significant effect on algal \u03b2 carotenes ( p >\u00a00.05) had been reported. The inter action effect of SBC together with WC, % exerted a significant negative influence on the algal proteins ( p >\u00a00.01) and no significant effect on the other responses ( p >\u00a00.05). The produced alga biomass was used for feeding the rotifer, Brachionus plicatilis for further application in aquaculture. Growth rate, reproductive rate and fecundity attributes, fatty acid content of B. plicatilis were amended. The Pearson correlation test indicated that \u03b2 carotenes displayed a highly positive significant correlation with the growth rate of B. plicatilis ( r =\u00a00.733, p <\u00a00.01) and the carbohydrates showed significant positive correlations with Egg % ( r =\u00a00.657, p <\u00a00.05).",

    "abstract": "Many new mothers do not reach their breastfeeding goals. Breastfeeding self\u2010efficacy is a modifiable determinant influenced by prior and new breastfeeding experiences. More knowledge about factors associated with early breastfeeding experiences and breastfeeding self\u2010efficacy would allow us to qualify breastfeeding counselling and increase breastfeeding duration. This study aimed to identify prevalence and factors associated with early negative breastfeeding experience, low breastfeeding self\u2010efficacy in the first week postpartum, and drop in self\u2010efficacy from late pregnancy to early postpartum period. A prospective longitudinal study was performed in Denmark from 2013 to 2014, including 2, 804 mothers. Results showed that 1 week postpartum almost 10% of mothers had negative breastfeeding experiences, 36% had low breastfeeding self\u2010efficacy, and 26% drop in self\u2010efficacy from pregnancy. Negative breastfeeding experiences were significantly associated with epidural analgesia, interrupted skin\u2010to\u2010skin contact immediately postpartum, short previous breastfeeding duration, and lacking social support. Low breastfeeding self\u2010efficacy was associated with low breastfeeding intention, short previous breastfeeding duration, and negative breastfeeding experiences in the first week postpartum. Finally, significant associations of drop in breastfeeding self\u2010efficacy from late pregnancy were no or short education, early negative breastfeeding experiences, prior short breastfeeding duration, and low general breastfeeding self\u2010efficacy in pregnancy. Negative breastfeeding experiences in the first week postpartum is crucial for maternal breastfeeding self\u2010efficacy 1 week following birth. It is important to identify and support mothers at risk of negative breastfeeding experiences in the first week following birth and address factors that might increase the probability of early successful breastfeeding experiences.",

    "abstract": "Down syndrome (DS) may be associated with various organ system disorders. Feeding problems are frequent in children with DS and may be caused by associated defects, including congenital heart defects, gastrointestinal defects, or endocrine disorders. In the absence of these associated conditions, feeding problems are often attributed to general hypotonia. However, an aberrant right subclavian artery (ARSA), a rare vascular anomaly and an unusual cause of problems with the passage of solid food through the esophagus, has recently been suggested to occur more frequently in patients with DS. This knowledge is of importance when evaluating feeding difficulties in patients with DS. Additional investigation for identifying an ARSA may be indicated in selected patients. Diagnostic techniques, such as transthoracic echocardiography, barium contrast esophagram, angiography, or computed tomography\u2013angiography (CT) can be used in a diagnostic flow chart. The presence of ARSA is not synonymous to the cause of feeding problems in patients with DS and corrective surgery of this vascular anomaly should be restricted to selected cases.",

To examine the temporal association of using food as reward with eating behaviour, body mass index (BMI) and weight status of children. Participants were 3642 children of the population\u2010based Generation R Study in the Netherlands (8.3% overweight/obese). Repeated assessments were collected at child ages 4 and 9\u2009years, including measured anthropometrics and parent reports on feeding practises and eating behaviour. Linear regressions and cross\u2010lagged models indicated that parents' use of food as reward at child age 4\u2009years predicted Emotional Overeating and Picky Eating at age 9\u2009years. Reversely, higher Emotional Overeating and Food Responsiveness scores were associated with more use of food as reward over time. Using food as reward was not associated with children's satiety response, BMI or overweight risk. A vicious cycle may appear in which children who display food approach behaviour are rewarded with food by their parents, which in turn might contribute to the development of unhealthy eating habits (emotional eating, fussiness). These findings warrant further research, to facilitate evidence\u2010based recommendations for parents.",

This was a\u00a0community-based\u00a0cross-sectional study\u00a0assessing 254 Portuguese adults (82.7% women; 35.82\u2009\u00b1\u200911.82\u00a0years) 1 week after the end of the first mandatory COVID-19 lockdown in Portugal. An online survey was conducted to evaluate psychological distress, disordered eating, and psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Pearson correlations and Structural Equation Modeling were performed. Participants reported the presence of meal skipping (52.8%), grazing eating behavior (80.9%), overeating (81.0%), loss of control over eating (47.2%), and binge eating episodes (39.2%) during lockdown. Structural equation modeling analyses, controlling for age and sex, indicated that there was a significant indirect effect of the experienced psychosocial impact of COVID-19 pandemic on disordered eating behaviors mediated through psychological distress. The psychosocial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis may lead to disordered eating, and this relation may occur through the elevation of psychological distress. These findings can be used to inform interventions, to enhance mental health and manage disordered eating during similar future situations. Level of evidence V: cross-sectional descriptive study",

    "abstract": "Anorexia and impaired appetite (Dysorexia) are common symptoms with varying causes, and often need no serious medical intervention. Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a chronic psychiatric disease with a high mortality rate. In Traditional Persian Medicine (TPM), anorexia is a condition in which anorexic patients lose appetite due to dystemperament. This review aims to discuss the common points of traditional and conventional approaches rather than introducing Persian medical recommendations suitable for nowadays use. For this purpose, Avicenna's Canon of Medicine, main TPM resources and important databases were reviewed using the related keywords. Despite complex hormonal explanation, etiology of AN in conventional approach is not completely understood. In TPM approach, the etiology and recommended interventions are thoroughly defined based on humoral pathophysiology. In TPM approach, disease states are regarded as the result of imbalances in organs\u2019 temperament and humors. In anorexia with simple dystemperament, the physician should attempt to balance the temperament using foods and medicaments which have opposite quality of temperament. Lifestyle, spiritual diseases (neuro \u2013 psychological) and gastrointestinal worms are the other causes for reducing appetite. Also, medicines and foods with warm temperaments (such as Pea soup and Mustard) are useful for these patients (cold temperament). Although the pathophysiology of AN in TPM is different in comparison with conventional views, TPM criteria for treatment this disorder is similar to those of current medicine. Recommending to have spiritual support and a healthy lifestyle are common in both views. Simple safe interventions recommended by TPM may be considered as alternative medical modalities after being confirmed by well-designed clinical trials.",

This review evaluated the impact of habitual social media engagement or exposure to image\u2010related content on body image and food choices in healthy young adults (18\u201030\u2009years). A systematic search of six databases of observational literature published 2005\u20102019, was conducted (PROSPERO Registration No. CRD42016036588). Inclusion criteria were: studies reporting social media engagement (posting, liking, commenting) or exposure to image\u2010related content in healthy young adults. Outcomes were: body image (satisfaction or dissatisfaction) and food choices (healthy eating, dieting/restricting, overeating/binging). Two authors independently screened, coded and evaluated studies for methodological quality. Thirty studies were identified (n = 11\u2009125 participants). Quantitative analysis (n = 26) identified social media engagement or exposure to image\u2010related content was associated with higher body dissatisfaction, dieting/restricting food, overeating, and choosing healthy foods. Qualitative analysis (n = 4) identified five themes: (i) social media encourages comparison between users, (ii) comparisons heighten feelings about the body, (iii) young adults modify their appearance to portray a perceived ideal image, (iv) young adults are aware of social media's impact on body image and food choices, however, (v) external validation via social media is pursued. Most studies (n = 17) controlled for some confounding variables (age, gender, BMI, ethnicity). Social media engagement or exposure to image\u2010related content may negatively impact body image and food choice in some healthy young adults. Health professionals designing social media campaigns for young adults should consider image\u2010related content, to not heighten body dissatisfaction.",

    "abstract": "To examine if body satisfaction is associated with body mass index (BMI) change and whether it protects against the development of frequent binge eating among overweight and obese adolescent girls. We used prospective data from 9 waves of an ongoing cohort study of adolescents, the Growing Up Today Study. At enrollment in 1996, participants were 9 to 14 years old. Questionnaires were mailed to participants annually until 2001, then biennially through 2007. Girls who were overweight or obese in 1996 were included in the analysis (n=1 559). Our outcomes were annual change in BMI and incident frequent binge eating, defined as binge eating at least weekly and no use of compensatory behaviors. At baseline, 57.2% of the overweight and obese girls were at least somewhat satisfied with their bodies. During 11 years of follow-up, 9.5% (95% confidence interval (CI) [7.8, 10.8]) of the girls started to binge eat frequently. Controlling for BMI and other confounders, overweight and obese girls who reported being at least somewhat satisfied with their bodies made smaller BMI gains (\u03b2=\u22120.10 kg/m 2 , 95% CI [\u22120.19, \u22120.02]) and had 61% lower odds of starting to binge eat frequently (odds ratio (OR)=0.39, 95% CI [0.24, 0.64]) than their less satisfied peers. Compared to girls who were the least satisfied with their bodies, girls who were the most satisfied had 85% lower odds of starting to binge eat frequently (OR=0.15, 95% CI [0.06, 0.37]). The association between body satisfaction and starting to binge eat frequently was stronger for younger adolescents than older adolescents. While body dissatisfaction is common among overweight and obese girls, body satisfaction may protect against excessive weight gain and binge eating. Prevention of body dissatisfaction must begin early and should be considered as a component of both obesity and eating disorder prevention programs.",

    "abstract": "Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) is a major chronic liver disease worldwide and can range from simple steatosis, inflammation to fibrosis/cirrhosis possibly through leaky gut and systemic endotoxemia. We investigated whether pomegranate (POM) protects against binge alcohol-induced gut leakiness, endotoxemia, and inflammatory liver damage. After POM pretreatment for 10 days, rats were exposed to 3 oral doses of binge alcohol (5\u202fg/kg/dose) or dextrose (as control) at 12-h intervals. Binge alcohol exposure induced leaky gut with significantly elevated plasma endotoxin and inflammatory fatty liver by increasing the levels of oxidative and nitrative stress marker proteins such as ethanol-inducible CYP2E1, inducible nitric oxide synthase, and nitrated proteins in the small intestine and liver. POM pretreatment significantly reduced the alcohol-induced gut barrier dysfunction, plasma endotoxin and inflammatory liver disease by inhibiting the elevated oxidative and nitrative stress marker proteins. POM pretreatment significantly restored the levels of intestinal tight junction (TJ) proteins such as ZO-1, occludin, claudin-1, and claundin-3 markedly diminished after alcohol-exposure. In addition, the levels of gut adherent junction (AJ) proteins (e.g., \u03b2-catenin and E-cadherin) and desmosome plakoglobin along with associated protein \u03b1-tubulin were clearly decreased in binge alcohol-exposed rats but restored to basal levels in POM-pretreated rats. Immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot analyses revealed that intestinal claudin-1 protein was nitrated and ubiquitinated in alcohol-exposed rats, whereas these modifications were significantly blocked by POM pretreatment. These results showed for the first time that POM can prevent alcohol-induced gut leakiness and inflammatory liver injury by suppressing oxidative and nitrative stress.",

Method : 162 women (87 purging, 75 non-purging) treated in outpatient or hospitals\u00a0+\u00a0outpatient care units in Spain participated. The evaluation instruments were: BSQ, EAT-40, EDI, STAI, BDI and BITE. Results : At the beginning of the treatment, participants with purging behavior showed higher bulimic symptomatology, more body dissatisfaction, drive for thinness, perfectionism and ineffectiveness, anxiety and depressive symptomatology. After thirty months, intervention produced improvement in ED characteristics, emotional alterations and personal development variables, in both groups, but less in patients with no purging behavior. The effect of intervention was stronger in purging patients and variables with larger effect size: body dissatisfaction, bulimic symptomatology and anxiety.

    "abstract": "Oxytocin, a hypothalamic neuropeptide essential for breastfeeding, is mainly produced in oxytocin neurons in the supraoptic nucleus (SON) and paraventricular nucleus. However, mechanisms underlying oxytocin secretion, specifically the involvement of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 3 (HCN3) in oxytocin neuronal activity, remain unclear. Using a rat model of intermittent and continuous pup deprivation (PD) at the middle stage of lactation, we analyzed the contribution of HCN3 in oxytocin receptor (OTR)-associated signaling cascade to oxytocin neuronal activity in the SON. PD caused maternal depression, anxiety, milk shortage, involution of the mammary glands, and delays in uterine recovery, particularly in continuous PD. PD increased hypothalamic but not plasma oxytocin levels in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In the SON, PD increased c-Fos expression but reduced expressions of cyclooxygenase-2 and HCN3 in Western blots and/or immunohistochemistry. Moreover, PD significantly increased the molecular association of OTR with HCN3 in coimmunoprecipitation. In brain slices, inhibition of HCN3 activity with DK-AH269 blocked prostaglandin E 2 -evoked increase in the firing activity and burst discharge in oxytocin neurons in patch-clamp recordings. In addition, oxytocin-evoked increase in the molecular association between OTR and HCN3 in brain slices of the SON was blocked by pretreatment with indomethacin, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2. These results indicate that normal activity of oxytocin neurons is under the regulation of an oxytocin receptor\u2013cyclooxygenase-2\u2013HCN3 pathway and that PD disrupts maternal behavior through increasing intranuclear oxytocin secretion in the SON but likely reducing bolus oxytocin release into the blood through inhibition of HCN3 activity.",

Conversely, meals eaten at home can be brought from outside, as take-out and home deliveries have become common in Korea. Thus, we tested whether or not meal preparation location influences daily diet quality. From the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) 2007-2009, 4,915 Korean adults (20-64 years) were classified into two groups: home-made meal group (HMG), who ate \u2265 2 meals per day prepared at home (n = 4,146), and non-home-made meal group (NHMG), who ate \u2265 2 meals per day prepared outside home (n = 769). Daily diet quality was determined by energy intake, nutrient intake, Dietary Variety Score (DVS), and Diet Diversity Score (DDS). Compared to the HMG, the NHMG was more likely to consist of men, single, employed, educated and of a higher economic status (all, P < 0.01). The NHMG showed higher energy intakes (1,776 vs. 2,116 kcal/day) with higher percentages of energy from protein (15 vs. 23%) and fat (14 vs. 16%) and lower intakes of dietary fiber, phosphorus, potassium, niacin, and vitamin C (all, P < 0.01) than the HMG, with some variations among age groups. The NHMG tended to consume foods prepared by frying and grilling and had more one-dish meals such as bibimbap , noodles, and dumplings but also showed higher dietary diversity. It should be noted that home-made meals do not necessarily guarantee a healthy diet, and the effects of meal preparation location on nutritional status might vary depending on socio-demographic characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Breastfeeding is an established mode of transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection resulting in clash between socio-cultural values and medical practice. This study aims to determine the effect of post-natal maternal antiretroviral therapy on transmission of HIV through breastfeeding. A total of 318 pregnant women were followed from pregnancy to 6 months post- partum. The women were divided into breast-fed and those who did not breast-feed, while the breast-fed were further divided into those on antiretroviral (ARV) and those not on ARV. After 6 months post-partum, dried blood spots were collected from infants born to these women and tested for HIV using polymerase chain reaction. Generally, breast-feeding had 4 to 13 fold increase risk of transmission of HIV to infants (OR =7.079 95% CI = 3.768, 13.300; P <0.0001). However, among breast-fed infants, post-natal maternal ARV resulted in reduced prevalence of HIV compared to mothers who did not use ARV during breast-feeding (17.31% VS 92.00%; P<0.0001). The study demonstrates the effectiveness of post\u2013natal maternal ARV. However, research into better feeding options to prevent mother to child transmission of HIV via breast-feeding is advocated.",

In the more recent past, this condition has been primarily observed after repeated application of heating pads. Today, unintentional and unperceived exposure to heat from laptop computers needs to be considered as a potential trigger. A rising number of laptop-induced cases of EAI have been reported recently.

    "abstract": "The core symptom of binge eating disorder (BED) is recurrent binge eating that is accompanied by a sense of loss of control. BED is frequently associated with obesity, one of the main public health challenges today. Experimental studies deliver evidence that general trait impulsivity and disorder-specific food-related impulsivity constitute risk factors for BED. Cognitive-behavioural treatment (CBT) is deemed to be the most effective intervention concerning BED. We developed a group intervention based on CBT and especially focusing on impulsivity. We hypothesise that such an impulsivity-focused group intervention is able to increase control over impulsive eating behaviour, that is, reduce binge eating episodes, further eating pathology and impulsivity. Body weight might also be influenced in the long term. The present randomised controlled trial investigates the feasibility, acceptance and efficacy of this impulsivity-focused group intervention in patients with BED. We compare 39 patients with BED in the experimental group to 39 patients with BED in the control group at three appointments: before and after the group intervention and in a 3-month follow-up. Patients with BED in the experimental group receive 8 weekly sessions of the impulsivity-focused group intervention with 5-6 patients per group. Patients with BED in the control group receive no group intervention. The primary outcome is the binge eating frequency over the past 4\u2005weeks. Secondary outcomes comprise further eating pathology, general impulsivity and food-related impulsivity assessed by eye tracking methodology, and body weight. Additionally, we assess binge eating and other impulsive behaviour weekly in process analyses during the time period of the group intervention. This study has been approved by the ethics committee of the medical faculty of Eberhard Karls University T\u00fcbingen and the University Hospital T\u00fcbingen.

    "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a serious psychiatric illness associated with significant medical and psychiatric morbidity, psychosocial impairment, increased risk of death, and chronicity. Given the severity of the disorder, the establishment of safe and effective treatments is necessary. Several treatments have been tried in AN, but few favorable results have emerged. This paper reviews randomized controlled trials in AN, and provides a synthesis of existing data regarding the efficacy, safety, and adherence associated with pharmacologic and psychological interventions. Randomized controlled trials for the treatment of AN published in peer-reviewed journals were identified by electronic and manual searches. Overall, pharmacotherapy has limited benefits in the treatment of AN, with some promising preliminary findings associated with olanzapine, an antipsychotic agent. No single psychological intervention has demonstrated clear superiority in treating adults with AN. In adolescents with AN, the evidence base is strongest for the use of family therapy over alternative individual psychotherapies. Results highlight challenges in both treating individuals with AN and in studying the effects of those treatments, and further emphasize the importance of continued efforts to develop novel interventions. Treatment trials currently underway and areas for future research are discussed.",

    "abstract": "The benefits of breastfeeding for improved health and developmental outcomes in mothers and their infants have been widely recognized. The purpose of the present study was to assess whether feeding modes influence maternal blood pressure at one month postpartum. The pregnancy charts of 407 women who delivered at a birthing center in rural Japan between August 1998 and September 2007 were analyzed. The criteria for inclusion were low-risk, full-term pregnancy (duration, 37\u201342 weeks) resulting in spontaneous vaginal deliveries, intrapartum hemorrhage < 500 mL, and a healthy infant (Apgar score \u2265 8 at one minute). The subjects were classified into three groups based on feeding modes. The proportion of each mode was 28.3% in the breastfeeding group, 56.5% in the mixed-feeding group, and 15.2% in the formula-feeding group. The systolic blood pressure (SBP) in mothers at one month postpartum for each feeding mode was 118.4 \u00b1 8.7 mmHg in the breastfeeding group, 120.6 \u00b1 9.3 mmHg in the mixed-feeding group, and 122.0 \u00b1 9.9 mmHg in the formula-feeding group. SBP at one month postpartum in the breastfeeding group was significantly lower than that in the other groups. No significant differences were observed in diastolic blood pressure in the three groups at one month postpartum. Breastfeeding resulted in lower SBP in mothers at one month postpartum compared with those using other feeding modes, thus indicating an effect of breastfeeding on maternal blood pressure.",

Studies comparing the effects of parenteral nutrition (PN) and enteral feeding (EF) on the post-surgical correction of CHD are not available. We compared the effects of PN with EF on the nutritional status of children post-cardiac surgery. A retrospective cohort study was conducted with 72 children aged \u22646 years who had at least one heart surgery between 2010 and 2016. Malnutrition was defined as a weight for height Z-score (WHZ) below \u22122. The primary endpoint was the change in the mean WHZ Z-score from the baseline. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 21.0 [Release 21.0.0.0, IBM, USA]. The sample size realized as 72 ( n = 72). The overall prevalence of malnutrition was 48%. The change in height of the PN group was significantly higher than the EF group (14.2 \u00b1 7.6 cm vs. 7.4 \u00b1 6.3, P = 0.010), but the weight change was not significantly different ( P = 0.28). The post-surgery Z-scores were significantly lower in the PN group and the Z-score change was marginally smaller ( P = 0.086), indicating lower growth levels post-surgery. The PN group had a significantly higher incidence of post-surgical malnutrition ( P = 0.046). Patients who received PN had significantly less improvement (more negative change) in the Z-score levels compared to the EF group (PE = \u22121.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [\u22122.48, \u22120.35]; P = 0.011).

This is an observational pilot study in which all subjects were treated with phentermine for 8 weeks and appetite and eating behaviors were measured at baseline and week 8. Outcomes were compared in subjects with \u22655% vs <5% weight loss, and linear regression was used to identify predictors of percent weight loss. 27 subjects (37 \u00b1 4.5 yrs, 93.8 \u00b1 12.1 kg, BMI 33.8 \u00b1 3.1 kg/m 2 ) completed the study, with mean weight loss of -5.4 \u00b1 3.3 kg (-5.7 \u00b1 3.2%). Subjects with \u22655% weight loss had higher baseline pre-breakfast hunger (p=0.017), desire to eat (p=0.003), and prospective food consumption (0.006), and lower baseline cognitive restraint (p=0.01). In addition, higher baseline home prospective food consumption (p=0.002) and lower baseline cognitive restraint (p<0.001) were found to be predictors of weight loss. These results suggest that individuals reporting greater hunger and less restraint are more likely to achieve significant weight loss with phentermine. This information can be used clinically to determine who might benefit most from phentermine treatment.",

However, it should be noted that disorders resulting in severe malnutrition, such as anorexia nervosa (AN), can precipitate nonalcoholic WE. AN is a life threatening psychological and eating disorder defined by inappropriate weight loss from food restriction due to the fear of gaining weight and immoderate desire to be thin. Treatment of those suffering with AN can often be complicated by severe electrolyte derangements after caloric intake termed refeeding syndrome. Although extremely rare, severe cardiomyopathy and ultimately death may occur in patients from AN. Herein describes the case of a 20-year-old female with AN induced WE complicated by refeeding syndrome and hemodynamic compromise in the setting of findings consistent with takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She required ventilatory and hemodynamic support with aggressive intravenous thiamine and phosphorus repletion. Nutritional supplementation was imperative and carefully administered throughout her hospitalization. Her symptoms improved over the course of a few weeks with an ultimate reversal of her cardiomyopathy. Given the morbidity surrounding AN, practitioners should exhibit caution when caring for those with severe nutritional deficiencies. Clinicians must monitor for severe electrolyte abnormalities and offer aggressive repletion. In addition to electrolyte derangements, severe cardiomyopathy may result as a rare sequela of the aforementioned complications associated with AN. Moreover, it is imperative to understand that patients with AN have the highest mortality of any psychiatric disorder and early intervention is necessary for survival in this vulnerable patient population.",

    "abstract": "There is very little information on what is considered an adequate energy intake for mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients. The purpose of the present study was to determine this energy requirement by making use of patients' nutritional status. The study was conducted in a multidisciplinary intensive care unit of Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taiwan. Patients were hemodynamically stable and not comatose, and were requiring at least 7 days of mechanical ventilation. Fifty-four patients successfully completed this study. The resting energy expenditure was measured using indirect calorimetry. The total energy requirement was considered 120% of the measured energy expenditure. The daily nutrient intake was recorded. Nutritional status was assessed using single and multiple parameters, nitrogen balance, and medical records, and was performed within 24 hours of admission and after 7 days in the intensive care unit. Fifteen patients were being underfed (<90% of total energy requirement), 20 patients were in the appropriate feeding (AF) group (within \u00b1 10% of total energy requirement), and 19 patients received overfeeding (>110% of total energy requirement). Patients in the underfeeding group received only 68.3% of their energy requirement, while the overfeeding group patients received up to 136.5% of their required calories. Only patients in the AF group had a positive nitrogen balance (0.04 \u00b1 5.1) on day 7. AF group patients had a significantly higher Nutritional Risk Index value at day 7 than at day 1. AF patients had more improvement in nutritional status than patients in the other feeding groups. To provide at least 120% of the resting energy expenditure seemed adequate to meet the caloric energy needs of hemodynamically stable, mechanically ventilated, critically ill patients.",

    "abstract": "Paraventricular nucleus (PVN) neurons expressing the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) integrate hormonal and neuronal information concerning energy availability and engage neural circuitry controlling feeding, metabolism, and neuroendocrine function in response to changes in body weight and stored energy. Thereby, the dynamic activity of PVN MC4R neurons may serve as a neural representation of body weight \u201cset point.\u201d Here, we demonstrate that PVN MC4R neuronal activity is bidirectionally regulated by changes in energy state, as neuronal activity is gradually suppressed during fasting and increased in response to refeeding. Together, these findings provide a framework for understanding how hunger and satiety are controlled within critical neurons involved in energy homeostasis. Mutations in the melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) result in hyperphagia and obesity and are the most common cause of monogenic obesity in humans. Preclinical rodent studies have determined that the critical role of the MC4R in controlling feeding can be mapped in part to its expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (paraventricular nucleus [PVN]), where it regulates the activity of anorexic neural circuits. Despite the critical role of PVN MC4R neurons in regulating feeding, the in vivo neuronal activity of these cells remains largely unstudied, and the network activity of PVN MC4R neurons has not been determined. Here, we utilize in vivo single-cell endomicroscopic and mathematical approaches to determine the activity and network dynamics of PVN MC4R neurons in response to changes in energy state and pharmacological manipulation of central melanocortin receptors. We determine that PVN MC4R neurons exhibit both quantitative and qualitative changes in response to fasting and refeeding. Pharmacological stimulation of MC4R with the therapeutic MC4R agonist setmelanotide rapidly increases basal PVN MC4R activity, while stimulation of melanocortin 3 receptor (MC3R) inhibits PVN MC4R activity. Finally, we find that distinct PVN MC4R neuronal ensembles encode energy deficit and energy surfeit and that energy surfeit is associated with enhanced network connections within PVN MC4R neurons. These findings provide valuable insight into the neural dynamics underlying hunger and energy surfeit.",

Alterations in Nts have recently been described in individuals with obesity or eating disorders, suggesting that disrupted Nts signaling may contribute to body weight disturbance. Curiously, Nts mediates seemingly opposing regulation of body weight via different tissues. Peripherally acting Nts promotes fat absorption and weight gain, whereas central Nts signaling suppresses feeding and weight gain. Thus, because Nts is pleiotropic, a location-based approach must be used to understand its contributions to disordered body weight and whether the Nts system might be leveraged to improve metabolic health. Here we review the role of Nts signaling in the brain to understand the sites, receptors, and mechanisms by which Nts can promote behaviors that modify body weight. New techniques permitting site-specific modulation of Nts and Nts receptor\u2013expressing cells suggest that, even in the brain, not all Nts circuitry exerts the same function. Intriguingly, there may be dedicated brain regions and circuits via which Nts specifically suppresses feeding behavior and weight gain vs other Nts-attributed physiology. Defining the central mechanisms by which Nts signaling modifies body weight may suggest strategies to correct disrupted energy balance, as needed to address overweight, obesity, and eating disorders.",

    "abstract": "The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block with its wide application has shown to be an analgesic effective for use in abdominal surgeries, including for cesarean section. However, the bupivacaine delivered in the TAP block comes with the risk of toxicity, both central nerve system (CNS) and cardiovascular system, and has been shown in some instances to reach maximum serum concentrations in excess of the 2 \u03bcg/mL associated with the lower end of CNS toxicity. There is a specific concern with cesarean section TAP blocks of the anesthetic passage to the neonate via maternal breast milk and whether this poses a toxicity risk. Bupivacaine has been shown to pass into maternal milk at concentrations 0.34 times the maternal serum concentration. Preliminary statistical analyses suggest that the bupivacaine delivered in breast milk is not in concentrations high enough to cause neonatal toxicity, but further studies would be useful in identifying what the toxicity risk is, if any, to the neonates' breastfeeding after the delivery and TAP block.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to perform the Creating Opportunities for Parent Empowerment (COPE) program for Iranian mothers and evaluate its effectiveness on stress, anxiety, and participation of mothers who have premature infants hospitalized in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). A randomized clinical trial was conducted with 90 mothers of premature infants hospitalized in the educational neonatal NICUs of state hospitals affiliated to Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. For measuring the variables, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Parental Stressor Scale: Neonatal Intensive Care, and The Index of Parental Participation/Hospitalized Infant were used. Intervention group received two phases of COPE program. This program consisted of information and behavioral activities about the characteristics of premature infants. Sessions\u2019 interval was from 2 to 4 days. Stress and anxiety were measured three times (before each phase and 2-4 days after the second phase). Mothers\u2019 participation was evaluated 2-4 days after the second phase. The t -test, \u03c7 2 , Mann-Whitney U test, and repeated measurement test were used for data analysis. Mothers in the intervention group reported significantly less anxiety and less stress in the NICU after performing each phase of the COPE program ( P < 0.001), whereas at this time, the level of stress in the comparison group increased. Also, COPE mothers participated in their infants\u2019 care rather than the mothers in the comparison group ( P < 0.001). COPE program was effective for Iranian mothers. This study shows that irrespective of any culture, giving early and comprehensible educational-behavioral information may have positive effect on maternal psychological condition and maternal\u2013infant interaction.",

This study aims to determine factors associated with exclusive breastfeeding. Design and Methods: The cluster random sampling method was used to obtain data from a total of 273 babies in the first 1000 days of life i.e. aged 6-24 months and analyzed using linear regression at \u03b1= 0.05. The data obtained were based on exclusive breastfeeding using maternal age, education, family income, frequency of antenatal care, nutritional status before pregnancy, place and mode of delivery, gestational age at delivery. Results: The result showed that exclusive breastfeeding was significantly affected by nutritional status before pregnancy based on MUAC (P=0.15) and BMI (P=0.047), family income (P=0.047) and initiation of early breastfeeding (P=0.001). Conclusions: In conclusion, nutritional status before pregnancy tends to benefit the family income, therefore, initiating early breastfeeding need to be improved for successful exclusive breastfeeding. Significance for public health Overcoming barriers to exclusive breastfeeding helps to determine the effectiveness of successful breastfeeding program.

This report presents a case of severe CP with mental retardation, which resulted in anorexia and condylar fracture of the femur following a surgery for bilateral lower limb joint contracture. Case report: A 14-year-old male was diagnosed with CP having severity of Gross Motor Functional Classification System Level V, and severe mental retardation. Due to bilateral spasticity in hip adduction, knee flexion, and valgus of the feet, tenotomies of the adductors of both hips, bilateral lengthening of the hamstrings and bilateral tenotomy of the peroneal tendons were performed. At 4 weeks postoperatively, knee casts were used; thereafter, knee extension braces were attached for 12 weeks. After surgery, he showed severe anorexia for 8 weeks and weight loss of 8.8 kg (from 35.2 kg to 26.4 kg) during the 4 months of hospitalization. Six months postoperatively, he was diagnosed with supracondylar fracture of the right femur. Discussion: Severe CP with mental retardation requires attention to the physical symptoms caused by stress related to the hospitalization, surgery, fixation by casts, and braces. Moreover, care must be taken not to increase the risk of fracture by fixation or immobility of the postoperative cast, because it can lead to the progression of low bone mineral density.",

Our objective was to examine the influence of breast feeding on child IQ at 5 years of age while taking maternal IQ and other relevant factors into account. Prospective observational study. Population-based birth cohort in Denmark. We used data from The Lifestyle During Pregnancy Study 1782 mother\u2013child pairs sampled from the Danish National Birth Cohort (n=101\u2009042). Child IQ was assessed at age 5 years by the Wechsler Primary and Preschool Scales of Intelligence-Revised. On the same occasion maternal intelligence was assessed by Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale and Raven\u2019s Standard Progressive Matrices. Exposure data on duration of breast feeding (n=1385) were extracted from telephone interviews conducted when the child was 6 and 18 months, and analyses were weighted by relevant sampling fractions. In multivariable linear regression analyses adjusted for potential confounders breast feeding was associated with child IQ at 5 years (categorical \u03c7 2 test for overall association p=0.03). Compared with children who were breast fed \u22641\u2009month, children breast fed for 2\u20133, 4\u20136, 7\u20139 and 10 or more months had 3.06 (95% CI 0.39 to 5.72), 2.03 (95% CI \u22120.38 to 4.44), 3.53 (95% CI 1.18 to 5.87) and 3.28 (95% CI 0.88 to 5.67) points higher IQ after adjustment for core confounders, respectively. There was no dose\u2013response relation and further analyses indicated that the main difference in IQ was between breast feeding \u22641\u2009month versus >1\u2009month. Breastfeeding duration of 1\u2009month or shorter compared with longer periods was associated with approximately three points lower IQ, but there was no evidence of a dose\u2013response relation in this prospective birth cohort, where we were able to adjust for some of the most critical confounders, including maternal intelligence.",

All offspring consisted of 12-year old mono- or dizygotic twins and this made it possible to study the effect of breastfeeding on mean cognition scores as well as the moderating effects of breastfeeding on the heritability of variation in cognition. Information on breastfeeding and cognitive ability was available for 6,569 children. Breastfeeding status was prospectively assessed in the first years after birth of the children. Maternal education is positively associated with performance on a standardized test for cognitive ability in offspring. A significant effect of breastfeeding on cognition was also observed. The effect was similar for offspring with mothers with a high, middle, and low educational level. Breast-fed children of highly educated mothers score on average 7.6 point higher on a standardized test of cognitive abilities (CITO test; range 500\u2013550; effects size\u00a0=\u00a0.936) than formula-fed children of mothers with a low education. Individual differences in cognition scores are largely accounted for by additive genetic factors (80%) and breastfeeding does not modify the effect of genetic factors in any of the three strata of maternal education. Heritability was slightly lower in children with a mother with a middle-level education.",

Hence, we examine their shared genetic background using a cross-disorder GWAS meta-analysis of 3,495 AN cases, 2,688 OCD cases and 18,013 controls. We confirmed a high genetic correlation between AN and OCD (r g = 0.49 \u00b1 0.13, p = 9.07\u00d710 \u22127 ) and a sizable SNP heritability (SNP h 2 = 0.21 \u00b1 0.02) for the cross-disorder phenotype. Although no individual loci reached genome-wide significance, the cross-disorder phenotype showed strong positive genetic correlations with other psychiatric phenotypes (e.g., r g = 0.36 with bipolar disorder and 0.34 with neuroticism) and negative correlations with metabolic phenotypes (e.g., r g = \u22120.25 with BMI and \u22120.20 with triglycerides). Follow-up analyses revealed that although AN and OCD overlap heavily in their shared risk with other psychiatric phenotypes, the relationship with metabolic and anthropometric traits is markedly stronger for AN than for OCD. We further tested whether shared genetic risk for AN/OCD was associated with particular tissue or cell-type gene expression patterns and found that the basal ganglia and medium spiny neurons were most enriched for AN/OCD risk, consistent with neurobiological findings for both disorders. Our results confirm and extend genetic epidemiological findings of shared risk between AN and OCD and suggest that larger GWASs are warranted.",

Although studies have implicated a central role of the striatum in these dysfunctions, there have been no direct investigations on striatal functional connectivity in bulimia nervosa from a network perspective. We calculated the functional connectivity of striatal subregions based on the resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging data of 51 bulimia nervosa patients and 53 healthy women. Compared with the healthy women, bulimia nervosa patients showed increased positive functional connectivity in bilateral striatal nuclei and thalamus for nearly all of the striatal subregions, and increased negative functional connectivity in bilateral primary sensorimotor cortex and occipital areas for both ventral striatum and putamen subregions. Only for the putamen subregions, we observed reduced negative functional connectivity in the prefrontal (bilateral superior and middle frontal gyri) and parietal (right inferior parietal lobe and precuneus) areas. Several striatal connectivities with occipital and primary sensorimotor cortex significantly correlated with the severity of bulimia. The findings indicate bulimia nervosa-related alterations in striatal functional connectivity with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex supporting self-regulation, the subcortical striatum and thalamus involved in taste reward, as well as the visual occipital and sensorimotor regions mediating body image, which contribute to our understanding of neural circuitry of bulimia nervosa and encourage future therapeutic developments for bulimia nervosa by modulating striatal pathway.",

    "abstract": "The consumption of alcohol among young people and young adults has undergone, in recent decades, a sharp upsurge with the increasingly frequent intake of large quantities of alcohol. The aim of our study was to investigate socio-demographic, economic and behavioural factors that have a major impact on the voluntary alcohol habit in young people. The survey was conducted via administration of an anonymous questionnaire based on \u201cthe WHO Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test\u201d, disseminated on-line, to young people and young adults (aged 18 to 35). We examined a sample of 365 subjects. Consumption of wine and beer were predominant followed by super-alcohol mixes. We found correlations between alcohol use and the following variables: marital status (p < 0.001), parental education (mother p < 0.05; father p < 0.001), income level (p < 0.05), physical activity (p < 0.05) and voluptuous habits (smoke and coffee: p < 0.001.The 5% of men and 1% of women had car accidents during the previous year due to alcohol use and 15% said they did not remember what happened in an alcoholic evening once or twice a month. The phenomenon of alcohol consummation is deeply ingrained in our reality, with dangerous episodes of binge drinking in young adults with a higher prevalence in the female sex.",

    "abstract": "Excessive binge alcohol drinking has acute cardiac arrhythmogenic effects, including promotion of atrial fibrillation (AF), which underlies \u201cHoliday Heart Syndrome.\u201d The mechanism that couples binge alcohol abuse with AF susceptibility remains unclear. We previously reported stress-activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling contributes to AF development. This is interesting because JNK is implicated in alcohol-caused organ malfunction beyond the heart. The purpose of this study was to detail how JNK promotes binge alcohol-evoked susceptibility to AF. The authors found binge alcohol-exposure leads to activated JNK, specifically JNK2. Furthermore, binge alcohol induces AF (24- vs. 1.8-Hz burst pacing-induced episodes per attempt per animal), higher incidence of diastolic intracellular Ca 2+ activity (Ca 2+ waves, sarcoplasmic reticulum [SR] Ca 2+ leakage), and membrane voltage (V m ) and systolic Ca 2+ release spatiotemporal heterogeneity (\u0394t Vm-Ca ). These changes were completely eliminated by JNK inhibition both in vivo and in vitro. calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) is a proarrhythmic molecule known to drive SR Ca 2+ mishandling. The authors report for the first time that binge alcohol activates JNK2, which subsequently phosphorylates the CaMKII protein, enhancing CaMKII-driven SR Ca 2+ mishandling. CaMKII inhibition eliminates binge alcohol-evoked arrhythmic activities. Our studies demonstrate that binge alcohol exposure activates JNK2 in atria, which then drives CaMKII activation, prompting aberrant Ca 2+ waves and, thus, enhanced susceptibility to atrial arrhythmia. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized form of alcohol-driven kinase-on-kinase proarrhythmic crosstalk. Atrial JNK2 function represents a potential novel therapeutic target to treat and/or prevent AF.",

In order to promote appropriate infant feeding, the government has explored implementation of the Baby Friendly Community Initiative (BFCI). This study assessed maternal knowledge of attributes of complementary feeding following implementation of BFCI in Koibatek, Kenya. A randomized control study composed of 270 mother\u2013infant pairs previously enrolled in a BFCI programme in Koibatek was conducted. The study found that a significantly greater number of mothers in the intervention group were more knowledgeable about proper breastfeeding and complementary feeding aspects compared with controls ( P \u2264 0.001). About half (53%) of mothers in the intervention group had high knowledge scores in comparison with 20% of mothers in the control group. When the relationship between mothers' knowledge and complementary feeding practices (minimum meal frequency, minimum dietary diversity and minimum acceptable diet) was assessed, significant associations were observed ( P = 0.010, P \u2264 0.001 and P \u2264 0.001, respectively). The odds of having a high knowledge score regarding complementary feeding practices were significantly higher for the intervention group compared with the control group (odds ratio [OR]: 25.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] 13.62\u201349.55, P \u2264 0.001).

Problems include simplistic understandings of ethnicity and the role of culture in women\u2019s lives, and stereotypes held by health practitioners.  Objective To explore the extent to which cultural context makes a difference to experiences of breast\u2010feeding support for women of Bangladeshi origin and to consider the implications for the provision of culturally appropriate care.  Methods The study comprised individual interviews with 23 women of Bangladeshi origin and four health service managers, and focus group discussions with 28 health practitioners between February and December 2008. Participants were recruited from four localities in northern England.  Results Women\u2019s rich descriptions of various facets of their identities were in contrast to practitioners\u2019 representations of women of Bangladeshi origin as homogenous. Practitioners did not recognize when the needs of women of Bangladeshi origin were similar to those of the majority white population, or where cultural context made a difference to their experiences of breast\u2010feeding and breast\u2010feeding support. Some practitioners used cultural stereotypes which, combined with organizational constraints, resulted in services not meeting many of the women\u2019s needs.

In this article, we review recent findings on the role of epigenetic factors in eating disorders, address methodological issues that need to be considered when interpreting research findings, and comment on possible clinical applications. Evidence suggests that eating disorders implicate alterations of methylation in genes involved in the mental status, metabolism, anthropometric features and immunity. Furthermore, some research in individuals with anorexia nervosa suggests the presence of reversible, malnutrition-induced epigenetic alterations that \u2018reset\u2019 as patients recover. Epigenetic studies in the eating disorders corroborate the idea that eating disorder cause is multifactorial, and identify markers that could help inform our understanding of illness staging and subtyping that may explain the commonly progressive course of these disorders, and that may provide insights towards the development of novel interventions. Already, there is evidence to suggest that, in people with eating disorders, epigenetically informed interventions help reduce stigma and shame, and increase self-acceptance and hopes of recovery.

There is interest in monitoring the effects of interventions on plasma inflammatory and coagulation elements in people with HIV, as they have been linked to risk for morbid outcomes and HIV persistence. Understanding the effects of feeding and time of specimen acquisition is important for the correct scheduling of clinical sampling. We examined the effects of feeding on plasma inflammatory, coagulation and homeostatic indices among 24 non-diabetic people with HIV, with controlled viraemia and on antiretroviral therapy after fasting and then 1, 3 and 6 hours after ingesting a fatty meal, and also approximately 1 week later after fasting and after an isocaloric non-fatty meal. Plasma levels of IL-6, IL-7, IP-10, sCD14, sCD163, sTNFrII and D-dimer were monitored by immunoassay. Fasting levels of all markers obtained approximately 1 week apart were significantly correlated ( P <0.001). Mild alterations in plasma concentrations of inflammatory markers were observed after feeding but geometric means varied more than 10% from baseline for only IL-6 and IL-7. Meal type was differentially associated with changes in plasma levels for IL-7 only. Antiretroviral treatment regimen, body mass index and changes in plasma triglyceride levels were not linked to post-feeding changes in these biomarkers. These plasma inflammatory, coagulation and homeostatic indices are relatively stable at fasting and are only minimally affected by feeding or time of day. These findings will aid in the monitoring of inflammatory and homeostatic indices that may contribute to control of HIV expression and its persistence.",

Remitted patients showed higher sOB-R concentrations but no difference in FLI compared with the control group. Leptin and FLI were lower in the acutely ill patients compared with the control subjects, who showed no differences in Zn concentrations. Zn concentrations were not correlated with leptin, sOB-R or FLI concentrations in any of the three investigated subgroups.

The BSES-SF was translated into Hindi using a back and forth translation process to ensure linguistic validity. We enrolled a total of 210 married women who were mothers of infants at an urban primary health center in Delhi, India. The Cronbach's alpha for the Hindi translation of the BSES-SF was 0.87 with all except one correlation coefficient <0.3. We conducted an exploratory factor analysis using principal component analysis that revealed a two-component solution, which explained 47.9% and 16.7% of the total variance, respectively. Mothers perceiving higher social support registered significantly higher mean BSES-SF scores, indicating a greater confidence in their breastfeeding abilities ( P = 0.01). However, breastfeeding self-efficacy was unrelated to the mother's age, parity, and education. The women planning to breastfeed partially had lower BSES-SF scores compared to the woman adhering to EBF norms ( P < 0.001). The Hindi version of the BSES-SF demonstrates good reliability and validity and can also explain previous and planned breastfeeding behavior in mothers of infants.",

No consensus-based clinical practice guidelines have been established for patients with anorexia nervosa referred to a nephrologist. Patients with anorexia nervosa\u2013associated kidney disease diagnosed were analyzed retrospectively. Kidney outcomes were defined as doubling of serum creatinine level and/or progression to end-stage kidney disease. Patients with a history of anorexia nervosa with kidney disease, including electrolyte abnormalities, who were referred to our hospital between 1992 and 2017 were included. 14 female patients were included. The time from anorexia nervosa onset to the initial visit with a nephrologist was 17.8 years. At the first visit, median body mass index was 13.4\u00a0kg/m 2 , median serum creatinine level was 1.9\u00a0mg/dL, and median serum potassium level was 2.7\u00a0mmol/L. All patients showed hypokalemia and addictive vomiting or diuretic/laxative abuse. During the median observation period of 3.1 years, kidney outcomes occurred in 9 patients, and 2 died due to their anorexia nervosa. 4 patients underwent kidney biopsy. The kidney biopsy findings of these patients included hypertrophy of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, advanced glomerular collapse, and interstitial fibrosis, consistent with ischemic kidney injury and hypokalemic nephropathy. The sample size was small, and kidney function was assessed based on serum creatinine levels in patients with anorexia nervosa with low muscle mass. Most patients with anorexia nervosa referred to nephrologists had kidney disease at the time of the first visit. Improving kidney outcomes of patients with anorexia nervosa may require earlier collaboration between psychiatrists and nephrologists.",

    "abstract": "Optimal complementary feeding practices, a critical component of infant and young child feeding, has been demonstrated to prevent micronutrient deficiencies, stunting, overweight, and obesity. In Kenya, while impressive gains have been made in exclusive breastfeeding, progress in complementary feeding has been slow, and the country has failed to meet targets. Recent 2014 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey reveal that only 22% of Kenyan children, 6\u201323 months, met criteria for a minimum acceptable diet. This case study describes key actions for complementary feeding put in place by the Kenya Ministry of Health as well as approaches for improving and monitoring complementary feeding within existing health platforms. Experience from USAID's Maternal and Child Survival Program and Ministry of Health on development of 23 complementary feeding recipes through application of a national guide for recipe development and Trials of Improved Practices is described. Challenges in how to prepare, modify, and cook foods, including meat, for young children 6\u201323 months of age was relayed by mothers. Addressing cultural beliefs around complementary feeding meant providing reassurance to mothers that young children are developmentally able to digest fruit and vegetables and ready to consume animal\u2010source protein. Through the Baby Friendly Community Initiative platform, cooking demonstrations and key hygiene actions were integrated with complementary feeding messages. Future programming for complementary feeding should consider development of context specific counselling messages on consumption of animal source foods, strengthen production and use of local foods through agriculture\u2010nutrition linkages, and include complementary indicators through routine health monitoring systems to track progress.",

    "abstract": "Oral health is vital to the general well being and is a time-tested indicator of the systemic health of an individual. Oral cavity may be the primary site affected in endocrine disorders, renal disorders, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hematological, autoimmune cutaneous disorders, and psychosomatic disorders. Eating disorders (primarily Anorexia nervosa and bulimia) are psychosomatic disorders having multifaceted etiology, and characterized by abnormal eating patterns. In many cases, the oral cavity may be the only site of the manifestations of eating disorders. An oral physician may often unveil the mystery of this underlying systemic pathology by a vigilant and meticulous examination of the oral cavity. This not only helps in nabbing the disease in its early course but also prevents the patients from the appalling consequences due to the disease. This article aims to highlight the etiopathogenesis and various oral features in eating disorders. The oral physician should be familiar with the bizarre oral features of eating disorders and should work in close connection with other healthcare physicians to prevent the psychosomatic and systemic consequences.",

    "abstract": "Despite the enormous benefits of breastfeeding, working mothers face more challenges to meet the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations regarding successful breastfeeding practices. Little research has been done to understand the breastfeeding practices among working mothers in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and factors associated with delayed initiation and cessation of breastfeeding among working mothers with children under the age of two years in Abu Dhabi, the UAE. A cross-sectional multicenter study was conducted from March to September 2017. The study included both Emirati and non-Emirati mothers of children below the age of two years. The data were collected from seven government health care centers in Abu Dhabi as well as from the community. Mothers with young children attending the centers during the study days were approached by trained research assistants, who provided oral and written information about the study. Among the 1610 mother\u2013child pairs with complete data who were included in this study, 606 were working mothers giving an employment rate of 37.6%. The mean (standard deviation) of maternal age and children\u2019s age were 30.9 (5.1) years and 8.6 (6.1) months, respectively. Of the 606 mothers, 217 (35.8%) delayed initiation of breastfeeding, and 359 (59.2%) ceased breastfeeding. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, factors associated with delayed breastfeeding initiation among working mothers were older mother age (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI]1.01, 1.08), being of non-Arab nationality (AOR 2.24, 95% CI 1.53, 3.27), caesarean section (AOR 2.70, 95% CI 1.84, 3.96), non-rooming-in (AOR 3.85, 95% CI 1.56, 9.51) and mothers with low birth weight children (AOR 2.47, 95% CI 1.23, 4.94). The main factors associated with cessation of breastfeeding were being of non-Arab nationality (AOR 1.59, 95% CI 1.09, 2.31) and mother with high-income rating (AOR 2.79, 95% CI 1.36, 5.75). The study highlighted the need for urgent actions to improve the working mothers\u2019 conditions in order to promote optimal breastfeeding practices, including both early initiation and continuation of breastfeeding among all mothers in the UAE regardless of employment status. Policies to improve EBF rates among professional working mothers should include maternity leave extension to enable mothers to continue breastfeeding.",

    "abstract": "Breast milk is the only food for the neonate with vast benefits. Although breastfeeding process is natural but extensive research has revealed that mother requires active support for establishing and sustaining appropriate breast feeding practices. Due to high patient load, effective counselling of all pregnant ladies becomes a huge task. Video-assisted counselling has been tried for establishing and sustaining breastfeeding practices as it helps mothers to understand the procedure and process better as the video image is animated with a narrative voice. The objective is to study the effectiveness of video assisted breast feeding counselling in establishing and sustaining breast feeding practices. A Quasi experimental study was done in Obstetrics and Gynaecology department of BRD Medical College Gorakhpur from September 2019 to February 2020. Study subjects were pregnant ladies admitted in labour room for delivery. A total of 60 study subjects were allocated in Video-assisted breast feeding counselling group and same number in routine counselling group. Video-assisted counselling group breast feeding counselling was done with use of two videos (Video 1 is of 5 minute and 34 seconds duration and Video 2 is of 2 minutes and 50 seconds duration) demonstrations in labour room and post natal ward. Routine breast feeding counselling group received routine counselling as done by resident or consultants during their care. After the delivery the study participants were interviewed regarding their profile and breast feeding knowledge, motivation and behaviour and a scoring was done with Min. -0 to Max. 20 score. Higher proportion of early initiation of breast feeding was observed in the video assisted counselling group as compared with the routine counselling group. The mean knowledge score of the subjects\u2019 video-assisted counselling group the mean knowledge score was significantly higher. Motivation of mother for breast feeding and improvement in their behaviour and skill in video-assisted counselling group was higher in comparison to routine counselling group. Video-assisted counselling was found effective in successful initiation and establishment of breast feeding.",

A total of 197 young adult frequent drinkers (48.7% women, mean age\u00a0=\u00a020.8).

    "abstract": "Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most common tumors of the central nervous system, which is the most lethal brain cancer. GBM treatment is based primarily on surgical resection, combined with radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Despite the positive treatment, progression free survival and overall survival were not significantly prolonged because GBM almost always recurs. We are always looking forward to some new and effective treatments. In recent years, a novel treatment method called tumor treating fields (TTFields) for cancer treatment has been proposed. TTFields devices were approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for adjuvant treatment of recurrent and newly diagnosed GBMs in 2011 and 2015, respectively. This became the first breakthrough treatment for GBM in the past 10 years after the FDA approved bevacizumab for patients with relapsed GBM in 2009. This paper summarized the research results of TTFields in recent years and elaborated the mechanism of action of TTFields on GBM, including cell and animal experimental research, clinical application and social benefits.",

    "abstract": "Turnover of cardiac pacemaker cells may occur during the lifetime of the body, and we recently raised the hypothesis that specialized cardiac cells have in common the potential to generate cardiomyocytes from fibroblasts. To examine this hypothesis, we analyzed the ability of atrioventricular node cells (AVNCs) to generate functional cardiomyocytes in long-term culture. AVNCs were isolated from adult guinea pig hearts and cultured for up to three weeks. Under phase-contrast microscopic observation over time, it was found that within a week, a number of fibroblasts gathered around the AVNCs and formed cell clusters, and thereafter the cell clusters started to beat spontaneously. The nascent cell clusters expanded their area gradually by three weeks in culture and expressed specific cardiac genes and proteins. Maturation of newly formed cardiomyocytes seems to be slow in cultures of AVNCs compared with those of sinoatrial node cells. Stimulation of muscarinic receptors with acetylcholine induced a beating rate decrease which was blocked by atropine, and activation of adenylate cyclase activity with forskolin increased the beat rate, while stimulation of beta adrenoceptors by isoproterenol had no effect. These results indicate that AVNCs form a cluster of cells with properties of functional cardiomyocytes and provide evidence to support the hypothesis. \u2022 Atrioventricular node cells formed spontaneously beating cell clusters in culture. \u2022 The cell clusters expressed specific cardiac genes and proteins. \u2022 The properties of the cell clusters depended on their spontaneous beating rate. \u2022 Specialized cardiac cells may in common have the ability to generate cardiomyocytes.

    "abstract": "Social subordination in macaque females is a known chronic stressor and previous studies have shown that socially subordinate female rhesus monkeys consume fewer kilocalories than dominant animals when a typical laboratory chow diet is available. However, in a rich dietary environment that provides access to chow in combination with a more palatable diet (i.e. high in fat and refined sugar), subordinate animals consume significantly more daily kilocalories than dominant conspecifics. Substantial literature is available supporting the role of stress hormone signals in shaping dietary preferences and promoting the consumption of palatable, energy-dense foods. The present study was conducted using stable groups of adult female rhesus monkeys to test the hypothesis that pharmacological treatment with a brain penetrable corticotrophin-releasing factor type 1 receptor (CRF 1 ) antagonist would attenuate the stress-induced consumption of a palatable diet among subordinate animals in a rich dietary environment but would be without effect in dominant females. The results show that administration of the CRF 1 receptor antagonist significantly reduced daily caloric intake of both available diets among subordinate females compared to dominant females. Importantly, multiple regression analyses showed that the attenuation in caloric intake in response to Antalarmin (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) was significantly predicted by the frequency of submissive and aggressive behaviour emitted by females, independent of social status. Taken together, the findings support the involvement of activation of CRF 1 receptors in the stress-induced consumption of excess calories in a rich dietary environment and also support the growing literature concerning the importance of CRF for sustaining emotional feeding.",

We examined the clinical utility of the Diabetes Eating Problem Survey\u2010Revised (DEPS\u2010R), a brief self\u2010report questionnaire developed for patients with T1D, to identify at\u2010risk adolescents. We aimed to determine whether a positive DEPS\u2010R screen was predictive of a formal diagnosis of an eating disorder as per the DSM\u2010V. In addition, we assessed whether other variables including psychosocial characteristics and diabetes conflict were associated with an abnormal DEPS\u2010R screen. Cross\u2010sectional study of 116 T1D adolescents aged 12\u201017\u00a0years. All participants completed the DEPS\u2010R screening; both participants and parents completed a questionnaire addressing psychosocial characteristics/conflict around diabetes management. Clinical variables were obtained from participant charts. Differences were examined between positive and negative DEPS\u2010R groups. Adolescents who screened positive were offered a referral to a specialized eating disorder team for further assessment. From 116 participants (mean age\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD\u00a0=\u00a014.6\u00a0years\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.56), 21% (24/116) scored positive for DEPS\u2010R More females than males had abnormal DEPS\u2010R (75% vs 25%, P =\u00a00.001). Those with positive DEPS\u2010R score had higher HbA1c% (mean\u00a0=\u00a09.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3 vs 8.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.2, P =\u00a00.001).

Methods : We conducted a retrospective case-control study from March 2008 to April 2017 at the Children\u2019s Hospital of Zhejiang University, Zhejiang province, P. R. of China, which reviewed 958 children who had been diagnosed with leukemia in case group and 785 healthy children in control group. Data were obtained from medical records, and if the medical records were incomplete, we called mothers of children by phone to complete the data. Results : Breastfeeding reduces the risk of childhood leukemia; the effect is greater, if feeding continued for 7\u20139\u00a0months ( p =\u00a00.002). In addition, we suggest that some factors such as maternal age, smoking during pregnancy, abortion history, genetic factors, parents use of hair dye, and the history of using birth control pills before pregnancy can increase the risk of childhood leukemia. Conclusions : This study indicates that promoting breastfeeding for 7\u20139\u00a0months may help lower the childhood leukemia incidence.

Six distinct EPG waveforms characterizing the feeding behavior of the tea green leafhopper, categorized as waveforms A, C, E, S, F, and R, were obtained during the investigation. Duration of passive ingestion, possibly of phloem (E), was the longest among all the probing waveforms on susceptible cultivars, whereas durations of the salivation (S) waveform and stylet work waveform (F) became longer on resistant cultivars. The durations of waveforms S and F on the resistant cultivar Jiandecha were slightly longer than those on the less resistant cultivar Yunguidaye , and both were significantly longer than those on the susceptible cultivars Hangzhoudaye and Zhushan-1 . Waveform E was shorter on the resistant cultivar Jiandecha than on the less resistant cultivars Yunguidaye and was significantly shorter than on the susceptible cultivars ( Hangzhoudaye and Zhushan-1 ). It is suggested that E, S, and F are the important waveforms related to leafhopper feeding behavior and tea plant resistance. Based on the results, the resistance levels of tea cultivars against the tea leafhopper can be evaluated quickly by direct current EPG.",

While recent guidelines recommend involving fathers, grandmothers and other family members in maternal and child nutrition, we lack a comprehensive review of interventions that have engaged them. This scoping review aimed to address this gap by describing social and behavioural interventions to engage family members in maternal and child nutrition in low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries. We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Global Health and CINAHL for peer\u2010reviewed studies meeting inclusion criteria. We screened 6,570 abstracts, evaluated 179 full\u2010text articles, and included 87 articles from 63 studies. Studies reported a broad range of approaches to engage fathers, grandmothers and other family members to support maternal nutrition ( n =\u20096); breastfeeding ( n =\u200932); complementary feeding ( n =\u20096) and multiple maternal and child nutrition practices ( n =\u200919). Interventions were facility and community based; included individual and group\u2010based interpersonal communication, community mobilization, mass media and mHealth; and reached mothers and family members together or separately. Most interventions were located within the health sector; rare exceptions included nutrition\u2010sensitive agriculture, social protection, early child development and community development interventions. Few interventions addressed gender norms, decision\u2010making, and family dynamics or described formative research or theories informing intervention design. These diverse studies can shed light on innovative programme approaches to increase family support for maternal and child nutrition.",

We tested the hypothesis that RYGB has weight loss-independent effects on taste perception which influence eating behavior and contribute to the greater weight loss.

We evaluated: taste sensitivity for sweet, salty and savory stimuli; sucrose and monosodium glutamate (MSG) preferences; sweetness palatability; eating behavior; and expression of taste-related genes in biopsies of fungiform papillae. Weight loss induced by both procedures caused the same decrease in: preferred sucrose concentration (\u221212\u00b110%), perceived sweetness of sucrose (\u22127\u00b15%), cravings for sweets and fast-foods (\u221222 \u00b15%), influence of emotions (\u221227\u00b15%) and external food cues (\u221230\u00b14%) on eating behavior, and expression of \u03b1-gustducin in fungiform papillae (all P-values <0.05). RYGB, but not LAGB, shifted sweetness palatability from pleasant to unpleasant when repetitively tasting sucrose (P=0.05). Neither procedure affected taste detection thresholds or MSG preferences. LAGB and RYGB cause similar alterations in eating behaviors, when weight loss is matched. These changes in eating behavior were not associated with changes in taste sensitivity, suggesting other, as yet unknown, mechanisms are involved.",

Materials and Methods: We conducted a 23-week intervention with 100 mothers in rural Guatemala in 2013 and 2014. In group 1 ( n =\u200924), participants received health-promoting text messages. In group 2 ( n =\u200932), peer-to-peer groups were formed. In group 3 ( n =\u200930), peer-to-peer groups were formed, a health professional participated in the discussions, and participants received health-promoting messages. In the control group ( n =\u200914), participants were simply given a mobile phone. We measured changes in knowledge and self-reported behavior. Four focus groups in 2015 showed the perceptions of 44 additional women and the potential of the previously tested interventions in other marginalized areas.  Results: Significant relationships were found between group membership and changes in knowledge ( P <\u2009.001), and between changes in knowledge and self-reported behavior ( P =\u2009.010). Within peer-to-peer groups, 3665 text messages were shared; discussions covered topics such as breastfeeding practices, health concerns, and emotional issues. Focus groups revealed a deficit of support for mothers, a precariousness of public services, different cultural barriers affecting access to care, and the potential for scaling up.  Discussion: The complementarity of structural arrangements of mHealth interventions can play an important role in helping to encourage recommended breastfeeding attitudes along with providing rich information about challenges in rural areas.  Conclusion: A mixed-methods study was appropriate to compare the effects and assess the potential of mHealth strategies in a complex rural setting.",

Alcohol users were classified as dependent drinkers (using the DSM-IV criteria), binge drinkers (using criteria of the USA National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism) or low-risk drinkers (following recommendations of the Scientific board of trustees of the German Health Ministry). The final sample (n\u202f=\u202f94) consisted of 36 low-risk alcohol users, 37 binge drinkers and 21 abstinent alcohol dependent patients. Participants were administered a probabilistic implicit reward learning task and an explicit reward- and punishment-based trial-and-error-learning task. Alcohol dependent patients showed a lower performance in implicit and explicit reward learning than low risk drinkers. Binge drinkers learned less than low-risk drinkers in the implicit learning task. The results support the assumption that binge drinking and alcohol dependence are related to a chronic reward deficit. Binge drinking accompanied by implicit reward learning deficits could increase the risk for the development of an alcohol dependence. \u2022 Alcohol dependent patients were impaired in implicit and explicit reward learning. \u2022 Alcohol dependence may lead to implicit and explicit reward learning deficits. \u2022 Binge drinkers learned less than low-risk drinkers in the implicit learning task. \u2022 Binge drinking is related to implicit reward learning deficits.

The purpose of this study is to examine this online support forum to understand the information seeking and sharing practices of its users. We extracted a total of 258 original posts and 1,445 corresponding comments from http://Babycenter.com 's breastfeeding forum posted over a 10\u2010day period. Using content analysis, we coded the posts into 15 categories reflective of the types of information users were seeking. We then randomly selected 45 conversation threads across the most popular categories to further understand how users were sharing information. The most popular breastfeeding topics for which users sought out information included feeding challenges, supply issues, feeding schedule and duration, pumping, physical health, excretion issues, storing milk, nipple issues, and general breastfeeding questions. Participants elicited information from others using interviewing questions and built consensus around issues by agreeing with previous posts. They shared their knowledge and personal breastfeeding experiences and also provided encouragement to continue breastfeeding and overcome challenges. Online support forums are actively being used by breastfeeding mothers seeking information from others with similar experiences. This presents an important resource for breastfeeding mothers and may, therefore, be an important component of future breastfeeding interventions.",

    "abstract": "Triceratops developed complex dental morphology, allowing it to become a dominant herbivore in the late Mesozoic era. Herbivorous reptiles rarely evolve occluding dentitions that allow for the mastication (chewing) of plant matter. Conversely, most herbivorous mammals have occluding teeth with complex tissue architectures that self-wear to complex morphologies for orally processing plants. Dinosaurs stand out among reptiles in that several lineages acquired the capacity to masticate. In particular, the horned ceratopsian dinosaurs, among the most successful Late Cretaceous dinosaurian lineages, evolved slicing dentitions for the exploitation of tough, bulky plant matter. We show how Triceratops , a 9-m-long ceratopsian, and its relatives evolved teeth that wore during feeding to create fullers (recessed central regions on cutting blades) on the chewing surfaces. This unique morphology served to reduce friction during feeding. It was achieved through the evolution of a complex suite of osseous dental tissues rivaling the complexity of mammalian dentitions. Tribological (wear) properties of the tissues are preserved in ~66-million-year-old teeth, allowing the creation of a sophisticated three-dimensional biomechanical wear model that reveals how the complexes synergistically wore to create these implements. These findings, along with similar discoveries in hadrosaurids (duck-billed dinosaurs), suggest that tissue-mediated changes in dental morphology may have played a major role in the remarkable ecological diversification of these clades and perhaps other dinosaurian clades capable of mastication.",

Identifying the predicting elements in different behaviors is one of the most effective ways that can be considered in prevention programs in different communities, particularly in developing countries. The purpose of was to determine the perceived efficacy, benefits and barriers related to a healthy nutrition pattern and the relation of these variables with a healthy diet in male and female high school students in Izeh city. In this cross-sectional descriptive and analytic study conducted throughout high schools in Izeh City, the subjects were 500 students (300 girls and 200 boys) from the 1390-91 school years who were selected through the multistage random sampling method; the acquired data was then studied and analyzed. The data for this study was gathered through a multi-sectional questionnaire (that included demographic characteristics, self-efficacy, perceived benefits and barriers). The Independent t-test, Spearman's Correlation, Pearson's Correlation Coefficient and Linear Regression were used to interpret and analyze the data. Data analysis showed that the mean age of male participants was 15.67 \u00b1 0.95 years and females 15.86 \u00b1 1.16 years. The mean score for healthy eating patterns in male students was 46.83 \u00b1 14.86 and in female students 44.20 \u00b1 14.16 respectively. The mean score for perceived benefits of healthy eating in girls was significantly higher than that in boys. There was a direct meaningful relationship between the mean score of benefits and perceived self-efficacy with the healthy eating behaviors in the two sexes, ( P < 0.001). The results of the multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the most important predictive factors in the students\u2019 healthy eating behavior are self-efficacy and perceived benefits respectively and that perceived barriers is not an influencing predictor in healthy eating patterns. The results of this study showed that many factors influence students\u2019 diet pattern and undeniably the role of these factors are not alike in the two sexes. The results also showed that perceived self-efficacy and benefits of healthy nutrition strengthens healthy eating behavior in students and thus these factors should be considered by health authorities in the country in any future programming.",

Children and adolescents with ASD are more likely to present feeding problems than their typically developing peers are. The present narrative review of literature aims to highlight the most recent evidence about epidemiology and presentations of eating and mealtime behavioral abnormalities in ASD from infancy to adolescence. Abnormalities in breastfeeding and acceptance of complementary foods have been described by most of the studies evaluating ASD early feeding history. Among the various eating and mealtime behaviors identified in ASD children and adolescents, the most common was food selectivity. The present review also provides brief overviews of the various aspects of food that may influence food acceptance by ASD patients and of the correlation between eating problems and ASD core symptoms, as well as with cognitive level, language skills, and family environment. However, studies evaluating eating problems in ASD children and adolescents are very heterogeneous and they show methodological differences. Moreover, the absence of unique definitions of eating and mealtime behaviors in ASD further limits the comparability of studies.",

    "abstract": "The ability of health-care professionals to understand the lived experiences of their patients has become increasingly important but has been a difficult topic to investigate empirically because it involves two distinctive research strands: interpretative phenomenological analysis and patient\u2013provider communication. While interpretative phenomenological analysis focuses on experiences and illness narratives of patients, but not on therapist\u2019s understanding of those, patient\u2013provider communication surveys focus primarily on effective forms of communication without addressing the actual illness experiences of patients. There is a need for empirical research that combines both strands to investigate not only the experiences of patients but also whether professionals are able to understand these. This study combined both strands by means of a novel research method called the Imitation Game (combined with other qualitative methods). This sociological method was developed to investigate what different social groups know of each other\u2019s lifeworld. It focused on the important domain of eating disorder treatment to investigate whether therapists were able to understand the experiences of their patients and vice versa. This study provides insights into the domains in which therapists and patients were able to develop insights into each other\u2019s experiential knowledge (and where they had difficulties in doing so). The findings also implicate the high potential of the Imitation Game as an interdisciplinary research method. We propose that the Imitation Game may be particularly valuable as a \u2018can opener\u2019 that enables the development of in-depth, qualitative insights into the substantive themes that matter in the lifeworlds of patients and therapists.",

    "abstract": "Food-based dietary guidelines (FBDGs) are used to promote and maintain healthy eating in a population, by providing country-specific guidance. However, many African countries like Ethiopia do not have FBDGs. This paper describes the methodology for the development of Ethiopian FBDGs and for creating and evaluating a Healthy Eating Index and a scoring tool that can be used to monitor the adherence of the population to FBDGs. A multidisciplinary technical working group will be tasked to develop FBDGs for the general population above 2 years of age based on identification of priority diet-related public health problems and risk factors, and a systematic review of dietary patterns in relation to the identified priority health outcomes, following a multistep process. FBDGs will be translated into daily food choices for specific subpopulations by applying linear programming using data from the National Food Consumption Survey (NFCS) of 2011. FBDGs will be evaluated for cultural appropriateness, acceptability, consumer understanding and practicality. A dietary gap assessment will be conducted by comparing the national food supply with the country\u2019s food demand. In addition an Ethiopian Healthy Eating Index (EHEI) will be developed based on the FBDGs using the NFCS data. The EHEI will be evaluated by comparing the EHEI Score based on 24 hours diet recall with that of the EHEI Score based on a Food Frequency Questionnaire, by analysing the association of the EHEI Score with population characteristics and micronutrient intake with or without additional adjustment for energy intake. Finally, a brief Food Quality Screening tool scoring for the important EHEI components will be developed to enable evaluation for counselling. Ethical approval is received from the Scientific and Ethical Review Office of the Ethiopian Public Health Institute. The findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications.A dissemination workshop will be organised with key implementing sectors of the food system for a healthier diet ( http://a4nh.cgiar.org/our-research/research-flagships/ ) and with key public and private partners.

We sought to determine the association between neonatal perioperative brain injury and postnatal brain maturation with feeding\u2010tube dependency in patients with SVP at neonatal discharge and just before the stage\u20102 palliation. We evaluated a cohort of 48 term neonates with SVP who underwent pre\u2010 and postoperative brain magnetic resonance imaging. Perioperative brain injury and microstructural brain development were measured with diffusion tensor imaging including fractional anisotropy in white matter and apparent diffusion coefficient in gray matter. The primary outcome was defined as being 100% orally fed (binary). Of the patients 79% (38/48) were tube fed at hospital discharge, and 27% (12/45) were tube fed before stage\u20102 palliation. Perioperative brain injury did not differ by group. Orally fed patients had a faster rate of decrease in apparent diffusion coefficient (3%, 95% CI 1.7% to 4.6%, P <0.001) at discharge and a faster rate of increase in fractional anisotropy (1.4%, 95% CI 0.6% to 2.2%, P =0.001) at the time of stage\u20102 palliation compared with tube\u2010fed patients, denoting more robust brain development. Slower rate of postnatal brain maturation but not perioperative brain injury is associated with feeding modality in infancy. These results support the importance of brain health in optimizing feeding outcomes in patients with SVP .",

Using chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSLs), previous studies identified a QTL cluster of genes for rice eating and cooking quality in the interval R727\u2013G1149 on chromosome 8. In this study we report two QTLs for viscosity parameters, respectively controlling setback viscosity (SBV) and consistency viscosity (CSV), located in the same interval using rapid viscosity analyzer (RVA) profile as an indicator of eating quality. Previously reported QTL for AC was dissected into two components with opposite genetic effects. Of four QTLs, qCSV-8 and qAC-8-2 had stable genetic effects across three and four environments, respectively. qSBV-8 , qCSV-8 and qAC-8-1 partly overlapped, but were separated from qAC-8-2 . Based on data from an Affymetrix rice GeneChip, two genes related to starch biosynthesis at the qAC-8-2 locus were chosen for further quantitative expression analysis. Both genes showed enhanced expression in sub-CSSLs carrying the target qAC-8-2 allele, but not in sub-CSSLs without the target qAC-8-2 allele, indicating their possible role in rice quality determination. Molecular markers closely linked to the two stable QTL provide the opportunity for marker-assisted selection (MAS) in breeding high quality rice.",

We used fMRI to study the preoptic area of human volunteers. Subjects lay in a 3T MRI scanner and were subjected to whole body heating by a water-perfused suit, to a level that resulted in a low rate of discrete sweating events (measured by finger skin resistance). Control scans were taken under thermoneutral conditions in another group. A discrete cluster of voxels in the preoptic area showed activity that was significantly correlated with thermal sweating events. We then used this cluster as a seed to investigate whether other brain areas had activity correlated with its signal, and whether that correlation depended on thermal state. Several brain regions including the dorsal cingulate cortex, anterior insula and midbrain showed ongoing activity that was correlated with that of the preoptic seed more strongly during heating than during thermoneutrality. These data provide the first imaging evidence for a thermoregulatory role of the human preoptic area. They further suggest that during thermal stress, the preoptic area communicates to several other brain regions with known relevance to the control of autonomic effectors.",

This descriptive cross sectional study was conducted in selected primary health facilities in Ijebu-Ode. Multi stage sampling technique was employed to select 283 mother-child pairs. Data was collected using a pre-tested interviewer administered questionnaire which included the World Health Organization Infant and Young Child Feeding Indicators (WHO IYCF) and the Infant and Child Feeding Index (ICFI). Of the total 283 mother-child pairs studied, 33.6% met minimum meal frequency, 14.5% received minimum dietary diversity (\u22654 food groups) and 9.2% received minimum acceptable diet when assessed using the WHO IYCF indicators. Overall, appropriate complementary feeding was low (4.2%) and associated (p<0.05) with factors such as antenatal care visits, child welfare clinic attendance and mother\u2019s workplace. On the other hand, the ICFI categorized respondents into low (11.7%), medium (24.7%) and high (63.6%) ICFI scores and were associated (p<0.05) with mother\u2019s education and household size. This study revealed a high prevalence of inappropriate complementary feeding practices. The use of composite indices reflected these practices and their associated factors holistically as they revealed different dimensions of complementary feeding. This may be useful for monitoring, evaluation, research and the required advocacy for complementary feeding.",

Due to the spur of interest in zebrafish research, the need to establish and maintain a productive zebrafish housing facility is also increasing. Although literature is available for the maintenance of a zebrafish laboratory, a concise video protocol is lacking. This video illustrates the protocol for regular housing, feeding, breeding and raising of zebrafish larvae. This process will help researchers to understand the natural behaviour and optimal conditions of zebrafish husbandry and hence troubleshoot experimental issues that originate from the fish husbandry conditions.

    "abstract": "This study evaluated changes in ginsenoside compositions and antioxidant activities in hydroponic-cultured ginseng roots (HGR) and leaves (HGL) with heating temperature. Heat treatment was performed at temperatures of 90\u00b0C, 110\u00b0C, 130\u00b0C, and 150\u00b0C for 2 hours. The ginsenoside content varied significantly with heating temperature. The levels of ginsenosides Rg1 and Re in HGR decreased with increasing heating temperature. Ginsenosides F2, F4, Rk3, Rh4, Rg3 (S form), Rg3 (R form), Rk1, and Rg5, which were absent in the raw ginseng, were formed after heat treatment. The levels of ginsenosides Rg1, Re, Rf, and Rb1 in HGL decreased with increasing heating temperature. Conversely, ginsenosides Rk3, Rh4, Rg3 (R form), Rk1, and Rg5 increased with increasing heating temperature. In addition, ginsenoside contents of heated HGL were slightly higher than those of HGR. The highest extraction yield was 14.39% at 130\u00b0C, whereas the lowest value was 10.30% at 150\u00b0C. After heating, polyphenol contents of HGR and HGL increased from 0.43\u00a0mg gallic acid equivalent/g (mg\u00a0GAE eq/g) and 0.74\u00a0mg GAE eq/g to 6.16\u00a0mg GAE eq/g and 2.86\u00a0mg GAE eq/g, respectively. Antioxidant activities of HGR and HGL, measured by 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl and 2,2-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid radical scavenging ability, increased with increasing heating temperature. These results may aid in improving the biological activity and quality of ginseng subjected to heat treatments.",

A 35-year-old woman presented complaining of blurring in the Left Eye 15\u201330 minutes following breastfeeding at night hours. On clinical examination, the uncorrected visual acuity was 20/20 in both eyes and slit-lamp examination demonstrated cells in the anterior chamber (26\u201350\u00a0cells in field/3+ SUN working group grading) whereas the examination of the right eye was unremarkable. Dilated examination revealed a thin pigmented strand of iris in the Left Eye spanning from one edge of the iris to the other (1st to 8th h). This strand was connected at a single point to the anterior capsule of the lens and from the point of connection red blood cells flowed in a linear configuration that ended at the lower part of the anterior chamber. In this case report a patient with persistent pupillary membrane in the form of an individual iris strand connected to the anterior lens capsule presented with episodes of monocular vision loss. This occurred due to red blood cell dispersion from the iris strand during mesopic light conditions and pupil dilation while breastfeeding. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report in the literature.",

Ninety serum samples collected from 30 teenage female patients during the acute stage of AN and 30 healthy persons (CONTR) were subjected to biochemical analysis; patients with AN were examined at the beginning of the study (AN-I) and after hospitalization (AN-II), as a result of which partial stabilization of anthropometric measurements was achieved (an increase of body mass index (BMI) by 3.5 kg/m 2 ). Vaspin levels dropped at the end of the hospitalization (compared to AN-I, p < 0.05), achieving values comparable to the CONTR; moreover there was a positive correlation between VASP level and the achieved body weight in AN-II ( p < 0.05). Positive correlations were also noted with regard to VASP vs. NPB in AN-I ( p < 0.02) (and AN-II, p < 0.013), as well as in the case of VASP vs. NPW in the same groups ( p < 0.02 and p < 0.015, respectively). NPB concentration was higher in AN-I ( p < 0.05) and AN-II ( p < 0.018) than in CONTR, whereas there were no differences ( p > 0.05) with regard to levels of VASP, NPW, or TAS. The high level of NPB despite treatment and normalization of VASP level may suggest that there are chronic neuroendocrine disorders at play in anorexia nervosa.",

    "abstract": "Breastfeeding is an optimum, healthy, and economical mode of feeding an infant. However, many preventable obstacles hinder exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months of life. We aimed to assess the social-, maternal- and infant-related factors disturbing exclusive breastfeeding in the first six months of life. It is a retrospective study included 827 dyads of mothers and infants older than 6 months (411 exclusively breastfed, 311 artificially-fed and 105 mixed feds). Mothers were interviewed to obtain sociodemographic information, maternal medical history and perinatal history and a detailed history of infant feeding. Many factors were found to support the decision for artificial feeding rather than exclusive breastfeeding, including maternal age < 25 years (OR = 2.252), child birth order > 3rd (OR = 2.436), being a primi-para (OR = 1.878), single marital status (OR = 2.762), preterm infant (OR = 3.287) and complicated labor (OR = 1.841). Factors in favor of mixed feeding included cesarean section (OR = 2.004) and admission to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (OR = 1.925). Although it isn\u2019t a community-based study and its results can\u2019t be generalised, plans to improve health and development of children are preferable to include the following: health education and awareness programs about the importance of exclusive breastfeeding should be directed for young and first-time mothers.

This study aimed to assess the psychometric properties of the Brazilian Food Cravings Questionnaire-Trait-reduced (FCQ-T-r), a short version of the most widely used measure of this behavior. Undergraduate students (n=505) completed the full version of the FCQ-T and the Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire. Respondents\u2019 height and weight were also measured. Exploratory factor analyses were performed. The FCQ-T-r exhibited a single-factor structure and satisfactory internal consistency (\u03b1 > 0.80). A positive correlation was observed between FCQ-T-r scores and those of the original version. Furthermore, FCQ-T-r scores correlated positively with uncontrolled eating and emotional eating behaviors. No correlation was found between body mass index and FCQ-T-r scores. Considering our sample characteristics, we suggested specific FCQ-T-r cutoff points for males and females in the Brazilian population. Our results support the structure of the Brazilian adaptation of the FCQ-T-r, which seems to be a viable instrument to investigate food cravings, particularly in time-constrained settings. Further studies are needed to verify these findings in other age ranges and clinical samples.",

Dubreuil\u2019s argument proceeds in two steps. First, he identifies two behavioral traits that are supposed to be indicative of the presence of a capacity for inhibition and goal maintenance: cooperative feeding and cooperative breeding. Next, he tries to show that these behavioral traits most likely emerged in Homo heidelbergensis . In this paper, I show that neither of these steps are warranted in light of current scientific evidence, and thus, that the evolutionary background of human executive functions, such as inhibition and goal maintenance, remains obscure. Nonetheless, I suggest that cooperative breeding might mark a crucial step in the evolution of our species: its early emergence in Homo erectus might have favored a social intelligence that was required to get modernity really off the ground in Homo sapiens .",

The aim of the study was to understand the influence of seat selection on educational achievement. The seating positions of the medical students were recorded on an architectural plan during each class session and the means and standard deviations of the students\u2019 locations were calculated in X and Y orientations. The locations of the students in the class were analyzed based on three architectural classifications: interactional zone, distance from the board, and access to the aisles. Final exam scores were used to measure the students\u2019 educational achievement. Our results demonstrate that there is a statistically significant relationship between the student's locations in the class and their attendance and educational achievements. Two factors may effect on educational achievement: student seating in the high interactional zone and minimal changes in seating location. Seating in the high interaction zone was directly associated with higher performance and inversely correlated with the percentage of absences. This observation is consistent with the view that students in the front of the classroom are likely more motivated and interact with the lecturer more than their classmates.",

    "abstract": "Other than being a physiological process, pregnancy is a condition characterized by major adaptations of maternal endocrine and metabolic homeostasis that are necessary to accommodate the fetoplacental unit. Unfortunately, all these systemic, cellular, and molecular changes in maternal physiology also make the mother and the fetus more prone to adverse outcomes, including numerous alterations arising from viral infections. Common infections during pregnancy that have long been recognized as congenitally and perinatally transmissible to newborns include toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex viruses (originally coined as ToRCH infections). In addition, enterovirus, parvovirus B19, hepatitis virus, varicella-zoster virus, human immunodeficiency virus, Zika and Dengue virus, and, more recently, coronavirus infections including Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) infections (especially the novel SARS-CoV-2 responsible for the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), constitute relevant targets for current research on maternal-fetal interactions in viral infections during pregnancy. Appropriate maternal education from preconception to the early postnatal period is crucial to promote healthy pregnancies in general and to prevent and/or reduce the impact of viral infections in particular. Specifically, an adequate lifestyle based on proper nutrition plans and feeding interventions, whenever possible, might be crucial to reduce the risk of virus-related gestational diseases and accompanying complications in later life. Here we aim to provide an overview of the emerging literature addressing the impact of nutrition in the context of potentially harmful viral infections during pregnancy. Unlabelled Image",

To inform future research and policy, the objectives of our study were to identify risk factors for infant u6m SAM and describe the clinical and anthropometric outcomes of treatment with current management strategies. We conducted a prospective cohort study in infants u6m in Barisal district, Bangladesh. One group of 77 infants had SAM (weight\u2010for\u2010length Z\u2010score [WLZ] <\u22123 and/or bipedal oedema); 77 others were \u201cnon\u2010SAM\u201d (WLZ \u2265\u22122 to <+2, no oedema, mid\u2010upper\u2010arm circumference \u2265125\u00a0mm). All were enrolled at 4\u20138\u00a0weeks of age and followed up at 6\u00a0months. Maternal education and satisfaction with breastfeeding were among factors associated with SAM. Duration of exclusive breastfeeding was shorter at enrolment (3\u00b79\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1 vs. 5.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.2\u00a0weeks, P <\u00a00.0001) and at age 6\u00a0months (13.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.9 vs. 17.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.9\u00a0weeks; P =\u00a00.003) among SAM infants. Despite referral, only 13 (17%) reported for inpatient care, and at 6\u00a0months, 18 (23%) infants with SAM still had SAM, and 3 (3.9%) died. In the non\u2010SAM group, one child developed SAM, and none died. We conclude that current treatment strategies have limited practical effectiveness: poor uptake of inpatient referral being the main reason. World Health Organization recommendations and other intervention strategies of outpatient\u2010focused care for malnourished but clinically stable infants u6m need to be tested. Breastfeeding support is likely central to future treatment strategies but may be insufficient alone. Better case definitions of nutritionally at\u2010risk infants are also needed.",

    "abstract": "Breastfeeding is optimal for infant health, but more than 66% of mothers cease exclusive breastfeeding within three months after giving birth. Evaluating infants\u2019 sucking effort provides valuable diagnosis to mothers encountering barriers with breastfeeding. Sucking microstructure is defined as an array of metrics that comprehensively capture infants\u2019 ability to create a sealed latch onto mother\u2019s nipple and regulate feeding, including number of sucks, sucks per burst, number of bursts, intra suck interval, and maximal sucking pressure. In this paper, we proposed a breastfeeding diagnostic device (BDD) which allows convenient and objective measurement of infants\u2019 sucking microstructure in both home and clinical settings. BDD utilizes an air-based pressure transducer to measure infants\u2019 sucking behavior. We conducted pilot clinical studies on six dyads of mother and infant to test the feasibility of the BDD system. To facilitate comparison, both breastfeeding and bottle-feeding were conducted on the six dyads using the BDD in home settings, and the outcomes are comparable with prior recordings in research or clinical settings. By offering a convenient and objective measurement of the sucking microstructure, the BDD will provide clinically meaningful guidance and diagnosis to mothers struggling with breastfeeding. BDD will also serve as an objective metric useful in research areas relevant to infant behaviors, assessment of neurodevelopment, and potentially a screening tool for developmental disabilities.",

This study examined the significance of overvaluation of weight/shape among post-bariatric surgery patients with loss-of-control (LOC) eating. Participants were 145 individuals who underwent sleeve gastrectomy within the previous six months and reported regular LOC eating. Overvaluation of weight/shape, LOC eating, and eating-disorder psychopathology were assessed using the Eating Disorder Examination (EDE)-Bariatric-Surgery-Version interview; depressive symptoms and disability were assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), respectively. Overvaluation of weight/shape, examined continuously, was correlated significantly with higher levels of eating-disorder psychopathology (EDE), depression (BDI-II) and disability (SDS). Categorically, using established clinical cut-points, relative to the Subclinical Overvaluation group ( n =70, 48.3%), the Clinical Overvaluation group ( n =75, 51.7%) reported significantly greater frequency of LOC eating episodes and higher EDE, BDI-II, and SDS scores. The two groups did not differ significantly in current BMI or percent weight-loss following surgery. Our findings, which highlight the clinical significance of overvaluation of weight/shape among patients with LOC eating following bariatric surgery, are similar to those previously reported for binge-eating disorder.

Ten newly diagnosed and recurrent GBM patients in Germany (median age: 52.9\u2009years [31-79]) were prospectively monitored over the first month of transitioning from the first-generation to the second-generation Optune system. Questionnaires using a numerical analog scale assessed feedback at baseline (first generation) and after 1\u2009month of second-generation use. After transitioning to the second-generation system, compliance improved by more than 10% in four patients, was maintained in five patients and decreased by more than 10% in one patient. Following transition, eight out of nine patients reported a reduction in the triggering of malfunction alarms. Self-reported patient feedback showed improved handling and portability (weight, mobility) of the second- versus the first-generation Optune system. This patient user survey suggests that patient satisfaction with the second-generation Optune system is improved versus the first-generation system. Improved features of the new system help patients achieve and maintain a higher rate of treatment compliance.",

    "abstract": "Some studies suggest that hormonal contraception, pregnancy, and/or breastfeeding may influence rates of HIV disease progression. From 1994 to 2012, HIV discordant couples recruited at couples' voluntary HIV counseling and testing centers in Lusaka were followed 3-monthly. Multivariate survival analyses explored associations between time-varying contraception, pregnancy, and breastfeeding and 2 outcomes among HIV-positive women: (1) time to death and (2) time to antiretroviral treatment (ART) initiation. Among 1656 female seropositive, male seronegative couples followed for 3359 person-years (PY), 224 women died [6.7/100 PY; 95% confidence interval (CI): 5.8 to 7.6]. After 2003, 290 women initiated ART (14.5/100 PY; 95% CI: 12.9 to 16.2). In a multivariate model of time to death, hormonal implant [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 0.30; 95% CI: 0.10 to 0.98] and injectable (aHR = 0.59; 95% CI: 0.36 to 0.97) were significantly protective relative to nonhormonal method use, whereas oral contraceptive pill (OCP) use was not (aHR = 1.08; 95% CI: 0.74 to 1.57) controlling for baseline HIV disease stage, time-varying pregnancy, time-varying breastfeeding, and year of enrollment. In a multivariate model of time-to-ART initiation, implant was significantly protective (aHR = 0.54; 95% CI: 0.31 to 0.95), whereas OCP (aHR = 0.70; 95% CI: 0.44 to 1.10) and injectable (aHR = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.55 to 1.32) were not relative to nonhormonal method use controlling for variables above, woman's age, and literacy. Pregnancy was not significantly associated with death (aHR = 1.07; 95% CI: 0.68 to 1.66) or ART initiation (aHR = 1.24; 95% CI: 0.83 to 1.86), whereas breastfeeding was protective for death (aHR = 0.34; 95% CI: 0.19 to 0.62) and ART initiation (aHR = 0.49; 95% CI: 0.29 to 0.85). Hormonal implants and injectables significantly predicted lower mortality; implants were protective for ART initiation. OCPs and pregnancy were not associated with death or ART initiation, whereas breastfeeding was protective for both. Findings from this 18-year cohort study suggest that (1) HIV-positive women desiring pregnancy can be counseled to do so and breastfeed and (2) all effective contraceptive methods, including injectables and implants, should be promoted to prevent unintended pregnancy.",

    "abstract": "Night Eating Syndrome (NES) is a unique disorder characterized by a delayed pattern of food intake in which recurrent episodes of nocturnal eating and/or excessive food consumption occur after the evening meal. NES is a clinically important disorder due to its relationship to obesity, its association with other psychiatric disorders, and problems concerning sleep. However, NES often goes unrecognized by both health professionals and patients. The lack of knowledge regarding NES in clinical settings may lead to inadequate diagnoses and inappropriate treatment approaches. Therefore, the proper diagnosis of NES is the most important issue when identifying NES and providing treatment for this disorder. Clinical assessment tools such as the Night Eating Questionnaire may help health professionals working with populations vulnerable to NES. Although NES treatment studies are still in their infancy, antidepressant treatments and psychological therapies can be used for optimal management of patients with NES. Other treatment options such as melatonergic medications, light therapy, and the anticonvulsant topiramate also hold promise as future treatment options. The purpose of this review is to provide a summary of NES, including its diagnosis, comorbidities, and treatment approaches. Possible challenges addressing patients with NES and management options are also discussed.",

Cancerous cell lines plated on coverslips at the bottom of the ceramic Petri dishes are subjected to TTFields delivered in two orthogonal directions at various frequencies to facilitate treatment outcome tests, such as cell counts and clonogenic assays. The results presented in this report demonstrate that the optimal frequency of the TTFields with respect to both cell counts and clonogenic assays is 200 kHz for both ovarian and glioma cells.",

The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of different intestinal parasites on white adipose tissue hormones. Eighty-one children infected by different parasites and 35 apparently healthy children were enrolled in this study. All patients and controls were subjected to clinical examination, measurement of body mass index (BMI) and laboratory examination. For BMI percentiles, there was a significant increase in serum leptin level ( p = 0.042) and a significant decrease in serum adiponectin level ( p = 0.039) in uninfected children, whereas there were no significant changes in the infected group ( p = 0.068 and 0.082 respectively). A significant increase in leptin and decrease in adiponectin levels were observed for E. histolytica , Strongyloides and E. histolytica and Giardia infections compared to the control group ( p = 0.047, 0.035 and 0.019 for leptin, and p = 0.025, 0.038 and 0.041 for adiponectin, respectively). The infection by some intestinal parasites may deregulate the secretion of leptin and adiponectin and also affect the absorption of some nutrients which can disturb the BMI and cause anorexia.",

Despite availability of individual data on impact of multiple endocrinal, reproductive and even metabolic factors in PCOS individuals, the data on the co-existence of BED and depression in PCOS patients with its relationship on the quality of life in Saudi Arabian females is not found. Hence this study is aimed to elucidate the implication of PCOS on eating behaviour, induction of depression and general health quality in Saudi Arabian population of Riyadh. This is a cross-sectional study carried out in multiple health facilities of Riyadh from January to March 2019. The study samples (494) were recruited by convenience sampling and administered validated questionnaire by trained research participants. The data obtained was analysed by binary logistic regression using SPSS-IBM 25. Of the total 494 women participated in the study, 23.48% (116) were PCOS individuals. The odds of developing abnormal health related quality of (HRQ) in patients with PCOS was significantly (P\u00a0=\u00a00.000, OR\u00a0=\u00a03.472) high when compared to non-PCOS participants. The odds of showing high binge eating disorder (BED, P\u00a0=\u00a00.007, OR\u00a0=\u00a02.856) and depression (P\u00a0=\u00a00.000, OR\u00a0=\u00a02.497) scores in PCOS participants were significantly more than patients who were not having PCOS. Out of the three parameters studied, abnormal health related quality of life possessed a higher influence of PCOS compared to depression and abnormal eating behavior. In conclusion, the present study shows that women with PCOS are at a significant risk for depressive disorders, disorganized eating behavior and impaired quality of life. Therefore, necessary care and screening is required to minimize the impact of PCOS on already burdened individuals.",

Current understanding of eating behaviours in the workplace and their association with overweight, obesity and binge eating disorder (BED) is limited. Workplace eating behaviours and weight\u2010related self\u2010efficacy were examined in a sample of 98 individuals with overweight or obesity, with or without BED. Participants completed the Weight Efficacy Lifestyle Questionnaire, Work and Social Adjustment Scale, Worker's Perception of Environmental Factors, and a Workplace Questionnaire. Eating unplanned food occurred on average 2.43 times per week ( SD =\u00a03.37), and eating unplanned food even when meals were brought from home occurred on average 1.28 times per week ( SD =\u00a01.84). Individuals with BED purchased lunch even when they brought food from home significantly more frequently than did individuals without BED. Those with BED also reported significantly poorer work and social adjustment related to binge eating as compared with those without BED. The most significant barriers to healthy eating in the workplace were coworker influence, eating more food in general and more junk food in response to stress, eating unplanned food at work and time constraints. These factors may be important to target in weight\u2010loss treatment to increase individuals' weight loss success. As individuals with BED may be the most vulnerable to eating unplanned foods, clinicians may want to focus on this potential barrier in BED treatment.",

We compared the cost-effectiveness of 4 specialized nutritious foods to prevent stunting and wasting in children aged 6\u201323 mo in Burkina Faso. Four geographic regions were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 intervention arms: Corn-Soy Blend Plus (CSB+) programmed with separate fortified vegetable oil (the reference food), Corn-Soy-Whey Blend (CSWB; a new formulation) with oil, SuperCereal Plus (SC+), and ready-to-use supplementary food (RUSF). We compared the effects of each intervention arm on growth (length-for-age z score (LAZ), weight-for-length z score (WLZ), end-line stunting (LAZ < \u22122), and total monthly measurements of wasting (WLZ < \u22122). Rations were \u223c500\u00a0kcal/d, distributed monthly. Children were enrolled in the blanket supplementary feeding program at age \u223c6 mo and measured monthly for \u223c18 mo. Average costs per child reached were linked with effectiveness to compare the cost-effectiveness of each arm with CSB+ with oil. In our sample of 6112 children (CSB+, n =\u00a01519; CSWB, n =\u00a01503; SC+, n =\u00a01564; RUSF, n =\u00a01526), none of the foods prevented declines in growth. Children in the SC+ and RUSF arms were not significantly different than those in the CSB+ with oil arm. Children in the CSWB with oil arm experienced higher end-line (measurement at age 22.9\u201323.9 mo) stunting (OR: 2.07; 95% CI: 1.46, 2.94) and more months of wasting (incidence rate ratio: 1.29; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.51). CSB+ with oil was the least-expensive ration in all costing scenarios ($113\u2013131 2018 US dollars/enrolled child) and similar in effectiveness to SC+ and RUSF, and thus the most cost-effective product for the defined purposes.

Iodine need is higher during lactation; hence, mothers and children are at risk of iodine deficiency. We aimed to explore maternal iodine and thyroidal status during lactation. Pregnant women were recruited in Gothenburg, southwest Sweden. Maternal urine and serum were collected at pregnancy week 35\u201037 (n\u00a0=\u00a084) and 0.5, 4, and 12\u00a0months postpartum. Seventy mothers provided breast milk at 0.5\u00a0months. Median (interquartile range) breast\u2010milk iodine concentration was 90 (66\u2010116) \u03bcg/L. About 58% had breast\u2010milk iodine concentration <100\u00a0\u03bcg/L.

However, enteral feeding often leads to deficiency, when the actual intake of the patient is lower than the target demand, which seriously affects the recovery of patients. To implement the best practice for preventing and managing underfeeding during enteral nutrition, and to improve the nutritional status of patients with gastric cancer. The current study was conducted following the Joanna Briggs Institute Practical Application of Clinical Evidence System program. Phase one referred to the development of the project, consisting of the generation of the best evidence, mainly based on literature review and discussions within a panel of experts. Phase two was the implementation of the project, including baseline audit, training of enteral nutrition and change of clinical practice. Phase three was a postimplementation reaudit. The intake of enteral nutrition was observed in the first 3 days, and feeding intolerance of enteral nutrition was observed within the first week of enteral nutrition. Data were collected using self-designed questionnaires. The nutritional status of patients was measured using Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) at admission, and 1 week after surgery. A total of 60 patients with gastric cancer and 10 registered nurses were enrolled in this study. The compliance rate for all audit criteria increased postimplementation. The feeding rate of enteral nutrition postimplementation was higher than the baseline audit on the third day, 54.29% (\u00b112.01) vs. 42.89% (\u00b110.63), and the incidence of underfeeding was lower (30%, n =\u200a30) than the baseline audit (76.67%, n =\u200a30). Furthermore, the feeding intolerance postimplementation (26.67%, n =\u200a30) was lower than the baseline audit (76.67%, n =\u200a30) within 1 week of enteral nutrition. The PG-SGA scores were not significantly different between the baseline audit and postimplementation on the day of admission, while the scores were lower postimplementation (12.90\u200a\u00b1\u200a1.47) compared with the baseline audit (14.00\u200a\u00b1\u200a1.82). In this study, we performed an audit of the clinical nursing quality, which can guide nurses to accurately identify obstacles to the implementation of enteral nutrition, and standardize the implementation and management process, thereby improving the quality of nursing and the nutritional status of patients. The evidence-based practice might optimize the enteral nutrition process, enhance the efficacy of enteral nutrition, and improve the nutritional status of patients. Medical staff should develop an individualized nutritional support protocol for patients based on the results of nutritional status assessments.",

Participants were 100 athletes of mean age 28.3 years (18\u201362), of which there were 67 males and 35 females. The sample consisted of competitive and amateur athletes who participated in individual and group sports. They filled in the Exercise Addiction Inventory, Body Shape Questionnaire, a questionnaire assessing Eating Attitudes Test, Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Ratings of exercise addiction were positively correlated with BDI scores across the study sample. Exercise addiction ratings were associated with abnormal eating attitudes, but not with trait or state anxiety. Athletes engaging in individual sports scored marginally higher on depression scores than group athletes but there was no difference in depression scores between competitive and amateur athletes. Multiple regression analysis revealed that abnormal eating attitudes contributed significantly to ratings of exercise addiction and explained 7.7% of the variance. According to the Sobel test, the difference in the association between exercise addiction and eating disorder was significant. Therefore, body shape was a mediating factor between eating disorder and exercise addiction. This study extends our preliminary findings of an association between exercise addiction and depression. Second, abnormal eating attitudes may explain most of the variance of exercise addiction. This is a further support for previous evidence of comorbidity between exercise addiction and eating disorders.",

Shortwave diathermy (SWD) and microwave diathermy (MWD) are frequently used by physical therapists to treat musculoskeletal conditions. The therapeutic benefits are usually associated with an increase in tissue temperature; however, there is no consensus on the changes in blood flow. 1) To evaluate the behavior of temperature and arterial blood flow after the application of SWD and MWD to the lower limb of healthy women aged 18\u201330 and 2) to assess whether changes in limb positioning can influence SWD response. Among the subjects analyzed, 40 women were eligible to participate in the trial and were randomly allocated to the SWD group or the MWD group. Each group received 20\u00a0min of diathermy. After receiving the interventions, all patients crossed over to the other group, but the devices were detuned (sham). SWD was applied to the posterior compartment of the thigh and leg, with the knee in 0\u00b0 and 90\u00b0 of flexion, and the MWD applied to the posterior thigh. Skin temperature evaluation (digital infrared thermography) and assessment of blood flow velocity (Doppler ultrasound) were performed immediately before and 10 and 20\u00a0min after the application. Arterial blood flow increased after SWD diathermy (vs. Sham), but not after MWD diathermy. SWD promoted skin heating at the end of therapy in all areas analyzed, remaining above baseline even 20\u00a0min after the end of the application. MWD diathermy promoted skin heating in the posterior thigh, reflecting a rise in the temperature of the popliteal fossa area that remained for 10\u00a0min after the end of the application. The increase in arterial blood flow velocity depends on the size of the heating area, since it was only observed in the application of the SWD. However, after 20\u00a0min of application, the position of the lower leg did not affect the heating.",

Materials and methods: Facility based cross sectional study was conducted. The study used all the study population as source of data since they are small in number hence sample size calculation was not needed. This study was conducted at health institutions which provide ART and PMTCT service at Shashemene town. Structured questionnaires were developed by reviewing different literatures. Data collectors were trained and data were collected from February to March 2018. The data were analyzed using statistical package for social science (SPSS) version 20, descriptive statistics as well as bivariate and multivariate analysis were computed to identify the independent predictor of infant feeding practice and to control effect of confounders.  Results: On this study majority 175 (90.7%) of respondent breast feed their infants. Regarding feeding option about 154 (79.8%) chose EBF followed by complementary feeding. Concerning feeding practice majority of respondent 172 (89.1%) utilize safe feeding practice. On multivariate analysis only Counseling provided by health professional on infant feeding option was found as independent predictors of infant feeding practice with [AOR = 4.538 (CI = 1.099, 18.736)].  Conclusion: Higher proportion of HIV positive mothers follow safe infant feeding practice. Counseling by health professional was found as independent predictors of infant feeding practice. Further counseling by health professional needed to discourage mixed feeding practice.",

    "abstract": "Background Infant-feeding patterns may influence lifelong health. This study tested the hypothesis that longer duration of breastfeeding and later introduction of complementary foods in infancy are associated with reduced adult cardiovascular risk. Methods Data were pooled from 10\u2009912 subjects in the age range of 15\u201341\u2009years from five prospective birth-cohort studies in low-/middle-income countries (Brazil, Guatemala, India, Philippines and South Africa). Associations were examined between infant feeding (duration of breastfeeding and age at introduction of complementary foods) and adult blood pressure (BP), plasma glucose concentration and adiposity (skinfolds, waist circumference, percentage body fat and overweight/obesity). Analyses were adjusted for maternal socio-economic status, education, age, smoking, race and urban/rural residence and infant birth weight. Results There were no differences in outcomes between adults who were ever breastfed compared with those who were never breastfed. Duration of breastfeeding was not associated with adult diabetes prevalence or adiposity. There were U-shaped associations between duration of breastfeeding and systolic BP and hypertension; however, these were weak and inconsistent among the cohorts. Later introduction of complementary foods was associated with lower adult adiposity. Body mass index changed by \u22120.19\u2009kg/m 2 [95% confidence interval (CI) \u22120.37 to \u22120.01] and waist circumference by \u22120.45\u2009cm (95% CI \u22120.88 to \u22120.02) per 3-month increase in age at introduction of complementary foods. Conclusions There was no evidence that longer duration of breastfeeding is protective against adult hypertension, diabetes or overweight/adiposity in these low-/middle-income populations. Further research is required to determine whether \u2018exclusive\u2019 breastfeeding may be protective. Delaying complementary foods until 6 months, as recommended by the World Health Organization, may reduce the risk of adult overweight/adiposity, but the effect is likely to be small.",

Parents often limit their childrens' intake of these sweet foods using controlling feeding practices, such as restriction; yet, restrictive feeding practices are counterproductive for childrens' self\u2010regulation of energy intake. This study developed a family\u2010based behavioural intervention that taught parents alternatives to restrictive feeding practices and encouraged children to consume candy in moderation. Using the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST), parent\u2013child dyads ( N = 37) were randomized into one of eight conditions that included a combination of intervention components delivered over 4 weeks: home supply, parent shared decision making, child mindfulness and child attention control strategies. Retention rate at follow\u2010up was high (95%). Among parents who received parent shared decision making, 86.4% reported the structured\u2010based candy routine they set with their child was easy to follow. Most children reported child mindfulness (95%) and attention control (89.5%) strategies were easy to play. Children recalled 4.1 \u00b1 1.8 of the six mindfulness strategies and 2.7 \u00b1 1.6 of the five attention control strategies at follow\u2010up. Eating in the absence of hunger tended to be lower for children who received parent shared decision making and child mindfulness components. This intervention was feasible and well\u2010implemented in the home environment. Findings will inform future, larger interventions designed to test similar strategies on childrens; eating behaviours and self\u2010regulation.",

Breeders were fed Control ( CON ); CON\u00a0+\u00a01% microalgae ( DMA : Aurantiochytrium limacinum ) as the source of docosahexaenoic acid; and CON\u00a0+\u00a02.6% of a co-extruded mixture of full-fat flaxseed ( FFF ) and pulses mixture as source of \u03b1-linolenic acid. Test diets (DMA and FFF) were balanced for total n-3 FA and n-6: n-3 FA ratio. Samples of day-old progeny were euthanized for bone mineral content ( BMC ) and tibia collagen type II. The remaining pullets were fed posthatch treatments as follows: from breeder CON: CON ( CON-CON ), DMA ( CON-DMA ), and FFF ( CON-FFF ), from breeder DMA: CON ( DMA-CON ) and DMA ( DMA-DMA ) and from breeder FFF: CON ( FFF-CON ) and FFF ( FFF-FFF ). A total of 60 pullets per posthatch diets were reared in cages (12 pullets/cage, n = 5) with free access to feed and water, bled at 6, 12, and 18\u00a0wk of age ( WOA ) for bone turnover markers and necropsied at 18 WOA for tibia and femur samples. Day-old pullets from breeder fed CON had greater BMC ( P <\u00a00.001) relative to those from breeders fed other diets. There was strain and diet interaction ( P \u2264\u00a00.024) on tibia breaking strength ( TBS ) and tibia cortical ash concentration at 18 WOA such that diet responses were only observed in Shaver white pullets. In this context, TBS of DMA-DMA and FFF-FFF was greater than for pullets originating from CON breeder, and the cortical ash weight of DMA-DMA and FFF-FFF pullets was 23.8 and 20.2%, respectively, higher than for CON-CON pullets. In conclusions, the strain effects were strong on tibia attributes on 18-week-old pullets. Breeder feeding of n-3 FA was more effective when concomitant with posthatch feeding of n-3 FA in supporting the skeletal strength and cortical bone development in Shaver white pullets.

    "abstract": "This observational study done during April\u2013December 2020 at a tertiary-care hospital in Haryana (India) enrolled 152 SARS-CoV-2-exposed neonates. Among them, 150 neonates had perinatal SARS-CoV-2 exposure and 2 neonates had late postnatal exposure. Stable infant-mother dyads were roomed-in with precautions to support breastfeeding. Nasopharyngeal swabs collected from neonates were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. There was a high incidence of prematurity (23%), low birth weight (31%), intrauterine fetal distress (16%), perinatal asphyxia (6%), admission to neonatal intensive care unit (24%), and mortality (1.3%) among neonates with perinatal SARS-CoV-2 exposure. In this sub-group, 20 neonates tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swab sample(s). A recent official publication by the World Health Organization emphasizes that the perinatal SARS-CoV-2-exposed neonates found RT-PCR positive once in upper respiratory (non-sterile) sample must document viral persistence in another non-sterile sample for confirmation of mother-to-child virus transmission. With this approach, only one neonate was confirmed intrapartum transmission. A telephonic follow-up in discharged neonates at 1\u00a0month of age or 1\u00a0month postexposure recorded them all to be asymptomatic and doing well. Conclusion : Neonates with perinatal SARS-CoV-2 exposure constitute a high-risk group and it is not uncommon to get a positive RT-PCR report in upper respiratory sample(s) from these babies. Majority of them do not demonstrate viral persistence. Clinical outcomes are favorable in breastfed infants roomed-in with their asymptomatic-mild symptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected mothers following appropriate safety protocols. What is Known: \u2022Neonates with perinatal exposure suffer a high burden of morbidities and mortality. \u2022Still, an uncertainty exists about rooming-in and breastfeeding among neonates born to SARS-CoV-2 positive mothers. What is New: \u2022With the policy of mother-infant rooming-in and supporting breastfeeding, none of the neonate suffered clinical illness compatible with postnatal SARS-CoV-2 transmission and infection. \u2022Around 13% perinatal exposed neonates demonstrated SARS-CoV-2 RNA in nasopharyngeal swab samples but the majority of them did not demonstrate viral persistence.

    "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe psychiatric disorder that is difficult to treat and is associated with frequent relapses and high mortality rates. Psychiatric symptomatology (eg, depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder/behaviors) are common comorbidities. This review provides current information about safety and efficacy of antidepressant therapy for management of AN in adults. A literature review of randomized controlled trials, open-label studies, and case reports with adults or adults/adolescents was conducted. PubMed and Medline were searched using anorexia management and treatment, antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), fluoxetine, sertraline, citalopram, and mirtazapine in AN, relapse prevention in AN, and psychotropic medications in AN. The role and utility of antidepressants in AN were published in double-blind, placebo-controlled studies; open-label trials; and a retrospective study. Antidepressants should not be used as sole therapy for AN although their use for confounding symptomatology makes discerning efficacy difficult as they are given together with other therapies. Neurobiological changes due to starvation and AN itself complicate results interpretation. For safety, tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors are not recommended, and bupropion is contraindicated. Use of SSRIs during acute treatment lacks efficacy. Use of SSRIs\u2014primarily fluoxetine and to some extent citalopram, sertraline, or mirtazapine\u2014may aid in relapse prevention and improvement of psychiatric symptomatology in weight-restored anorexic patients. Health care professionals should use clinical judgment regarding fluoxetine or possibly citalopram, sertraline or mirtazapine as adjunctive treatment to psychotherapy for relapse prevention, improvement of depressive and anxiety symptoms, and/or obsessive-compulsive behaviors unresolved with nutritional rehabilitation and psychotherapy.",

The purpose of the present study was to examine the possible links between college students\u2019 passion for academic activities and problematic health behaviors including smoking, excessive drinking, exercise addiction, disordered eating, and sleepiness, which is a possible indicator of sleep deprivation. Participants (n = 502) completed a survey gauging passion type and health behaviors.

Rats were preconditioned with DK juice before administration of sucrose beverage continuously for 1-month. Blood glucose tolerance test and glutathione (GSH) homeostasis pathways in kidney were analyzed in different group of animals at the end of the study. DK juice diffused ( P < 0.001) hypertriglyceridemia inducing effect of sucrose and arrested sucrose induced weight gain. It improved glucose tolerance ability by significantly reducing ( P < 0.05) first-hour glycemic excursion and decreasing 2 h glycemic load ( P < 0.05) following oral glucose tolerance test in sucrose fed animals. Furthermore, disturbances in antioxidant defense mechanisms in terms of GSH homeostasis in kidney were restored due to juice feeding. DK juice administration checked reduction in GSH-S-transferase and glyoxalase-I activity, thus, significantly mitigated lipid peroxidation ( P < 0.05), and formation of advanced glycation end-products ( P < 0.001) in kidney and serum ( P < 0.01). Quantitative analysis of juice found it a rich source of protein and polyphenols. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis revealed the presence of multiple protein bands in whole fruit juice. Therefore, SDS-PAGE protein fingerprint of DK juice may serve as a quality control tool for standardization of juice. The whole fruit juice of DK may become cost-effective, affordable health beverage in extenuating ill-health effects of sugar consumption. This is the first report identifying DK juice in preventing development dysglycemia, dyslipidemia, and oxidative stress induced due to chronic sucrose feeding in rats.

The statistical population of the research comprised of male and female undergraduate students at Tabriz and Sarab branches of Payam- e- Noor University, Tabriz Islamic University and Azarbaijan Shahid Madani university in the academic year 2012 - 2013. A group of 640 university students, using the stratified random sampling method were screened by the obsessive compulsive inventory and the eating attitude test, then a group of 143 participants with high obsessive compulsive traits with another 137 participants with high eating disorder characteristics were selected and assessed with the Perfectionism Inventory. Data were analyzed using one way analysis of variance. The results showed that perfectionism and related negative dimension are more commonly found in people with high obsessive-compulsive traits than eating disorder characteristics (P < 0.02). The results showed the highest contribution of maladaptive perfectionism in predicting obsessive-compulsive features and pathological eating attitude. Also, no difference was found between the two groups in terms of negative perfectionism. The greater association of perfectionism with symptoms of obsessive-compulsive is consistent with its phenomenological feature. Fear of failure may motivate the behavioral components of perfectionism that aim to focus on careful checking, reassurance seeking and excessive consideration before making a decision.",

    "abstract": "Childhood obesity preventive interventions should promote a healthy diet and physical activity at home and school. This study aims to describe a school-based childhood obesity preventive programme (POIBA Project) targeting 8-to-12- year-olds. Evaluation study of a school-based intervention with a pre-post quasi-experimental design and a comparison group. Schools from disadvantaged neighbourhoods are oversampled. The intervention consists of 9 sessions, including 58 activities of a total duration between 9 and 13 hours, and the booster intervention of 2 sessions with 8 activities lasting 3 or 4 hours. They are multilevel (individual, family and school) and multicomponent (classroom, physical activity and family). Data are collected through anthropometric measurements, physical fitness tests and lifestyle surveys before and after the intervention and the booster intervention. In the intervention group, families complete two questionnaires about their children\u2019s eating habits and physical activity. The outcome variable is the cumulative incidence rate of obesity, obtained from body mass index values and body fat assessed by triceps skinfold thickness. The independent variables are socio-demographic, contextual, eating habits, food frequency, intensity of physical activity and use of new technologies. It is essential to implement preventive interventions at early ages and to follow its effects over time. Interventions involving diet and physical activity are the most common, being the most effective setting the school. The POIBA Project intervenes in both the school and family setting and focuses on the most disadvantaged groups, in which obesity is most pronounced and difficult to prevent. Significance for public health Overweight and obesity are a major public health concern that predispose affected individuals to the development of chronic diseases. Of importance, obesity is more common among disadvantaged neighbourhoods and it is precisely these environments that have the lowest involvement in preventive interventions. Consequently, it is very important to target these populations when designing an intervention. This study will provide an evaluated childhood obesity intervention which includes the perspective of gender and social inequalities. In addition, a sustainability plan has been developed for the intervention. It is planned that, in the near future, the intervention and its reinforcement are part of the set of health educational programmes offered by the Ag\u00e8ncia de Salut P\u00fablica de Barcelona (Spain) to schools, with funding both the cost of the training and the materials borne by the Ag\u00e8ncia.

    "abstract": "Recently, nanoparticles have been demonstrated to have tremendous merit in terms of improving the treatment specificity and thermal ablation effect on tumors. However, the potential toxicity and long-term side effects caused by the introduced nanoparticles and by expelling them out of the body following surgery remain a significant challenge. Here, we propose for the first time to directly adopt magnesium nanoparticles as the heating enhancer in laser thermal ablation to avoid these problems by making full use of the perfect biodegradable properties of this specific material. To better understand the new nano \u201cgreen\u201d hyperthermia modality, we evaluated the effects of magnesium nanoparticles on the temperature transients inside the human body subject to laser interstitial heating. Further, we experimentally investigated the heating enhancement effects of magnesium nanoparticles on a group of biological samples: oil, egg white, egg yolk, in vitro pig tissues, and the in vivo hind leg of rabbit when subjected to laser irradiation. Both the theoretical simulations and experimental measurements demonstrated that the target tissues injected with magnesium nanoparticles reached much higher temperatures than tissues without magnesium nanoparticles. This revealed the enhancing behavior of the new nanohyperthermia method. Given the unique features of magnesium nanoparticles \u2013 their complete biological safety and ability to enhance heating \u2013 which most other advanced metal nanoparticles do not possess, the use of magnesium nanoparticles in hyperthermia therapy offers an important \u201cgreen\u201d nanomedicine modality for treating tumors. This method has the potential to be used in clinics in the near future.",

This study aimed to examine the effect of husband participation on self-efficacy of breastfeeding in postpartum period.  Methods: This study was a single-blind clinical trial (IRCT2014012115163N2) conducted on 66 pregnant women who referred to health centers of Urmia in 2014. Convenience sampling method was used to select the participants and then they were randomly allocated to control and intervention groups using RANDBETWEEN function in Excel. Participants in the intervention group had 2 training sessions with 4-week interval. They could also use telephone counseling over study time. Those in the control group received the routine pregnancy care, and their breastfeeding self-efficacy was compared 1 month after delivery using Dennis Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy questionnaire. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 20. Chi square, independent and paired samples t test were used.  Results: In this study, the mean score of breastfeeding self-efficacy in the intervention and control groups after intervention was 50.36\u00b18.65 and 44.12\u00b110.41, respectively, which showed a statistically significant difference (p=0.017).  Conclusion: According to the results, one of the considerable strategies to enhance self-efficacy of breastfeeding is to involve husbands in prenatal care, which should be considered by the authorities and health professionals, including doctors, nurses, and midwives.",

    "abstract": "Piperine, the main alkaloid of black pepper ( Piper nigrum ), has been suggested to display several pharmacological properties, including pain relief, anticonvulsant, antidepressant-like, antianxiety, sedative, and anti-inflammatory effects. This study was designed to investigate the effect of piperine on learning in mice and the interaction of the effect with caffeine and diazepam. Piperine (100 mg/kg intraperitoneally) was injected into the mouse mothers or nursing dams during breastfeeding for 25 days at five-day intervals. After feeding the newborn mice, their learning was evaluated using a step-through passive avoidance task. Mouse learning was assessed 1 hr and 24 hr and 1 week after a training session. Piperine increased learning in the first (1 hr: 243.33 s vs 55.17 s, P = 0.002) and third assessments (1 week: 226 s vs 97 s, P < 0.05) post-training, but no significant change was seen at the second (24 hr) assessment. Piperine improved the effect of a low dose of caffeine (25 mg/kg intraperitoneally after a shock of 2 s duration) in a first assessment (295.17 s vs 149.17 s, P = 0.026) compared to a higher dose of caffeine. Piperine reversed diazepam (1 mg/kg intraperitoneally) suppression of learning 24 hours after training by a 4 s shock (298 s vs 135.67 s, P = 0.03). According to the results, piperine alone significantly increased learning 1 hour and 1 week after training assessments, and learning can be improved in the short term when followed by piperine administration. It was also shown that piperine can potentiate the effect of a low dose of caffeine and can reverse the effect of diazepam.",

A total of twenty-eight crossbred (Yorkshire \u00d7 Landrace) sows were distributed into four treatments as a 2 \u00d7 2 factorial arrangement. Sows in the FF group showed lower body weight and backfat loss ( p < 0.05) compared with the CF group. Backfat loss during lactation was lower ( p < 0.05) in sows fed HE diet than in that fed LE diet. There were no significant differences in litter survival rate and weaning to estrus interval, but the litter weight at weaning was improved ( p < 0.05) in FF and HE sows. Hence, it is concluded that using the free-feeding system or increased dietary energy density leads to improved sow performance during hot ambient temperature.",

    "abstract": "Recently, there has been an increased interest in the importance of family meals on children's health and nutrition. This study aims to examine if the eating habits and eating behaviors of children are different according to the frequency of family dinners. The subjects were third-grade students from 70 elementary schools in 17 cities nationwide. A two-stage stratified cluster sampling was employed. The survey questionnaire was composed of items that examined the general characteristics, family meals, eating habits, eating behaviors, and environmental influence on children's eating. The subjects responded to a self-reported questionnaire. Excluding the incomplete responses, the data (n = 3,435) were analyzed using \u03c7 2 -test or t-test. The group that had more frequent family dinners (\u2265 5 days/week, 63.4%), compared to those that had less (\u2264 4 days/week, 36.6%), showed better eating habits, such as eating meals regularly, performing desirable behaviors during meals, having breakfast frequently, having breakfast with family members ( P < 0.001), and not eating only what he or she likes ( P < 0.05). Those who had more frequent family dinners also consumed healthy foods with more frequency, including protein foods, dairy products, grains, vegetables, seaweeds ( P < 0.001), and fruits ( P < 0.01). However, unhealthy eating behaviors (e.g., eating fatty foods, salty foods, sweets, etc.) were not significantly different by the frequency of family dinners. Having dinner frequently with family members was associated with more desirable eating habits and with healthy eating behaviors in young children. Thus nutrition education might be planned to promote family dinners, by emphasizing the benefits of having family meals on children's health and nutrition and making more opportunities for family meals.",

The patients were stratified by the presence/absence of anorexia and of pre-treatment weight loss, which generated a measure composed of four categories, which were the independent variables. Among the 552 patients included in the study, anorexia and pre-treatment weight loss were present in 39.1% and 70.1%, respectively. After adjusting for age, male gender, and Karnofsky performance status, we found that anorexia and tumor size were significantly associated with pre-treatment weight loss. In a Cox multivariate analysis, adjusted for age, male gender and low Karnofsky performance status were found to be independent predictors of worse survival, as was concomitance of anorexia and weight loss. Anorexia and pre-treatment weight loss appear to be relevant problems in the follow-up of patients with advanced (stage IV) lung cancer Specific interventions are of crucial importance in individualized treatment plans, even within the context of palliative care.",

    "abstract": "The incidence of pancreatic cancer is increasing worldwide and characterized by a particularly low survival rate. Studies have reported weak and inconsistent evidence for associations among reproductive factors, use of exogenous hormones, and pancreatic cancer incidence in women. To investigate relationships between reproductive factors, exogenous hormones, and the rate of pancreatic cancer incidence in a large population-based prospective cohort of women in Norway. We used data from the Norwegian Women and Cancer study on 588 incident cases of pancreatic cancer diagnosed among 165,419 women, with mean follow-up of 18.7 years. Cox proportional-hazard models were used to estimate HRs and 95% CIs for associations of interest. Cumulative breastfeeding duration >24 months was associated with 63% decreased incidence of pancreatic cancer compared to no breastfeeding. We observed an inverse linear dose\u2013response trend between cumulative breastfeeding duration and pancreatic cancer incidence, which was confirmed in parous women and ever-smokers. Higher age at first birth and menopause were inversely associated with pancreatic cancer incidence, though with less precise effect estimates. Current use of oral contraceptives was associated with a doubling of pancreatic cancer incidence, but the analysis was hampered by a small number of cases. There was no evidence of any associations between age at menarche, parity or use of menopausal hormone therapy, and incidence of pancreatic cancer. Our results suggest a potential protective effect of breastfeeding duration against pancreatic cancer incidence. Inconsistent results for the other reproductive factors suggested no important role of estrogens in pancreatic cancer etiology.",

Aims : The objectives of this study were to evaluate the impact of a healthy eating intervention for children in after-school programs and to use photovoice to document change in eating behavior. Methods : Forty-two children in three after-school programs participated. Children participated in lessons from an existing program to learn about healthy eating. A mixed methods study was conducted, using surveys to assess parent and child perceptions, and photovoice to capture children\u2019s perceptions of how they and their family changed eating habits. Member-checking was used to verify themes in the data. Twenty parents completed surveys evaluating the program. Results : Findings indicated that children learned program information, were interested in eating healthier (more fruits and vegetables), and quantitative data revealed there was a pre-post trend for eating more fruits at home. They reported that using the photovoice method helped them to monitor their behavior and helped them improve personal and family eating habits. Member checking confirmed themes. A majority of parents were satisfied with the program and reported that their children were discussing what they learned at home. Conclusions : Findings suggested that the photovoice methodology helped children to change in a positive way, increasing their agency in improving their own health and that of their family. Assessing longitudinal change in attitudes about healthy eating and eating behaviors will provide information about whether children maintain gains in knowledge and healthy eating over time.",

Data were analyzed using Epi info and Fischer exact test and chi-square test were applied in the baseline data. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered significant. Effect of the BCC package is given in terms of relative risk. BCC package increased 1.76 times higher number of deliveries conducted by trained dais in intervention group. There was significant improvement in using sterile cord tie ( P = 0.01), applied nothing to the cord ( P < 0.0001) and giving bath to their baby within 6 h of birth ( P = 0.02) in intervention group as compared to nonintervention group. Significant difference was found between the two groups with regard to breastfeeding practices of baby. Harmful practices were reduced in the intervention group. Significant improvement was found in intervention group as compared to nonintervention group with regard to knowledge of danger signals, physiological variants, management of breastfeeding-related problems, and awareness of skin-to-skin technique for the management of hypothermic baby. Inadequate knowledge and adverse practices regarding neonatal care among mothers in study areas were found.

At age 22 and 26, the Eating Disorder Diagnostic Scale was used to assess the level of eating pathology. Higher negative affectivity in preadolescence was associated with higher BMI and eating pathology in young adulthood. Lower effortful control in preadolescence was found to be a risk factor for the development of obesity in young adulthood.

To determine whether eating slower can enhance satiety and reduce intake when rate of eating is manipulated and not manipulated in a kitchen setting using a sample of participants who exhibit high dietary restraint (HDR). Two samples of college students who exhibit HDR, which is a group likely to use behavioral strategies to manage intake, were selected in a prescreening session. Participants were told how fast or slow to eat (Variation 1) or allowed to eat at their own pace (Variation 2). Self-reported satiety during the meal and amount consumed was recorded. The types of foods, macronutrient intakes, weights of foods, order of food intakes, and the dimensions of foods were held constant between groups to control for group differences in the sensory and hedonic qualities of the meals. Eating slower enhanced mid-meal satiety ratings, but only when instructions were given to eat fast or slow (Variation 1). In both variations, eating slower did not reduce amount consumed in the meal, although each variation had sufficient power to detect differences. Eating slower is not likely to be an effective strategy to control intake in a meal among those exhibiting HDR.",

    "abstract": "Bloodfeeding is employed by many parasitic animals and requires specific innovations for efficient feeding. Some of these innovations are molecular features that are related to the inhibition of hemostasis. For example, bloodfeeding insects, bats, and leeches release proteins with anticoagulatory activity through their salivary secretions. The antistasin-like protein family, composed of serine protease inhibitors with one or more antistasin-like domains, is tightly linked to inhibition of hemostasis in leeches. However, this protein family has been recorded also in non-bloodfeeding invertebrates, such as cnidarians, mollusks, polychaetes, and oligochaetes. The present study aims to 1) root the antistasin-like gene tree and delimit the major orthologous groups, 2) identify potential independent origins of salivary proteins secreted by leeches, and 3) identify major changes in domain and/or motif structure within each orthologous group. Five clades containing leech antistasin-like proteins are distinguishable through rigorous phylogenetic analyses based on nine new transcriptomes and a diverse set of comparative data: the trypsin + leukocyte elastase inhibitors clade, the antistasin clade, the therostasin clade, and two additional, unnamed clades. The antistasin-like gene tree supports multiple origins of leech antistasin-like proteins due to the presence of both leech and non-leech sequences in one of the unnamed clades, but a single origin of factor Xa and trypsin + leukocyte elastase inhibitors. This is further supported by three sequence motifs that are exclusive to antistasins, the trypsin + leukocyte elastase inhibitor clade, and the therostasin clade, respectively. We discuss the implications of our findings for the evolution of this diverse family of leech anticoagulants.",

This study utilized the trials of improved practices ( TIPs ) methodology to gain an understanding of the cultural beliefs and perceptions related to feeding practices of infants and young children 0\u201323 months of age and used this information to work in tandem with 150 mothers to implement feasible solutions to feeding problems in L ower and U pper E gypt. The study triangulated in\u2010depth interviews ( IDIs ) with mothers participating in TIPs , with IDIs with 40 health providers, 40 fathers and 40 grandmothers to gain an understanding of the influence and importance of the role of other caretakers and health providers in supporting these feeding practices. Study findings reveal high consumption of junk foods among toddlers, increasing in age and peaking at 12\u201323 months of age. Sponge cakes and sugary biscuits are not perceived as harmful and considered \u2018ideal\u2019 common complementary foods. Junk foods and beverages often compensate for trivial amounts of food given. Mothers are cautious about introducing nutritious foods to young children because of fears of illness and inability to digest food. Although challenges in feeding nutritious foods exist, mothers were able to substitute junk foods with locally available and affordable foods. Future programming should build upon cultural considerations learned in TIPs to address sustainable, meaningful changes in infant and young child feeding to reduce junk foods and increase dietary quality, quantity and frequency.",

    "abstract": "Single ventricle (SV) physiology is associated with growth retardation in children. The nutritional status of pediatric patients with SV undergoing a bidirectional Glenn (BDG) procedure vitally affects the feasibility of the next operation stages. To explore the nutritional status and to identify specific anthropometric parameters relevant to short-term surgical outcomes in children with SV after the BDG procedure, this study included 151 patients who underwent the BDG procedure. Anthropometric assessments and Infant and Child Feeding Index (ICFI) scores were used to evaluate nutritional status. There was a significant statistical correlation between ICFI and malnutrition in both the height-for-age Z -score (HAZ) and weight-for-age Z -score (WAZ) groups ( P <\u20090.05). The clinical data, including ventilation time, nosocomial infection presence, pressure injury presence, peritoneal dialysis status, and total intensive care unit days, after BDG surgery were significantly different among the HAZ groups ( P <\u20090.05), while nosocomial infection was different among the WAZ groups ( P <\u20090.05). Children after BDG procedure had a high incidence of malnutrition, in addition to disease factors, the type and frequency of dietary intake were also important factors leading to worse clinical outcomes during hospitalization. Therefore, it is vital to maintain an optimal nutritional status in infants with SV who are undergoing a series of surgical procedures.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to assess the effects of energy-restricted feeding during rearing on the sexual maturation and reproductive performance of Rugao layer breeders. A total of 2,400 8-wk-old Rugao layer breeders were randomly assigned to one of 5 groups (480 pullets per group) with eight replicates and were fed one of 5 diets that were nutritionally similar with the exception of apparent metabolizable energy corrected for nitrogen ( AME n ) content (2,850, 2,750, 2,650, 2,550, and 2,450 kcal AME n /kg) from 8 to 18 wks of age. The daily amount of feed was restricted to the absolute quantity of the diet consumed by laying hens fed 2,850 kcal AME n per kg diet ad libitum (control). From 18 to 52 wks of age, all hens were fed basal diets ad libitum. The body weight of layer breeders at 18 wks of age decreased linearly with increasing energy restriction ( P < 0.001), but caught up within 3 wks of ad libitum feeding ( P =\u00a00.290). The coefficient of variation of the body weight of the hens at 18, 21, and 24 wks of age decreased linearly ( P =\u00a00.010, 0.025, and 0.041, respectively) with increasing energy restriction during rearing. Energy-restricted feeding delayed sexual organ development at 18, 20, and 22 wks of age, including the number of large yellow follicles, oviduct length, oviduct length index, oviduct index, and ovary stroma index ( P < 0.05), and delayed sexual maturity, including the age at laying the first egg and the age at 5% and 50% egg production ( P =\u00a00.042, 0.004, and 0.029, respectively). Consequently, egg number from 5% to 50% egg production decreased linearly as the degree of energy restriction increased ( P =\u00a00.001) and egg production of hens in the energy-restricted feeding groups was lower than that of hens in the ad libitum feeding group (6.36, 6.43, 6.4, and 4.61% vs. 14.29%; P < 0.05) from 18 to 20 wks of age. Furthermore, egg weight increased linearly as energy restriction increased ( P < 0.001) and laying hens in the most severe energy-restricted feeding group had more setting eggs (normal eggs weighing >40 g) than hens in the ad libitum feeding and lighter energy-restricted feeding groups (149.57 vs. 144.34, 142.66, 143.63, and 141.78; P < 0.05). No significant differences were observed in fertility, hatchability of fertile eggs, and hatchability of setting eggs ( P =\u00a00.381, 0.790, and 0.605, respectively). In conclusion, moderate energy restriction (85.97%, 2,450 vs. 2,850 kcal AME n /kg) from 8 to 18 wks of age increased egg weight as well as the production of setting eggs in native layer breeders throughout the laying period, without adverse effects on productive performance from 18 to 52 wks of age, or fertility and hatchability at 52 wks of age.",

    "abstract": "Breastfeeding is an unequalled way of providing ideal food for the infants. The benefits of breastfeeding practices to infants and mothers are well documented. However, information on breastfeeding practices and its effect on body mass index (BMI) of mothers are scarce, particularly in Ekiti State of Nigeria. Therefore, the present study is designed to assess breastfeeding practices and its association with BMI of mothers. A descriptive and cross-sectional study was conducted among breastfeeding mothers that attended postnatal clinic of the state specialist hospitals and maternity centers in the study location. The specialist hospital and two-third of the nine maternity centers were purposively selected because of their health facilities and personnel. The mother-child pairs (200 respondents) were randomly selected from the study locations. Information on demographic characteristic, socio-economic parameters, nutritional knowledge of breastfeeding and dietary intakes of mothers were collected using questionnaires. BMI of mothers was determined as described by World Health Organization. Age distribution of mothers was between 25-34 years; and almost half of respondents had good educational background and were engaged in different occupations. The respondent monthly income ranged between = N = 3500 - 26000 ($26.92 - $200); and their dietary intakes varied between starchy and protein-based food. The result also showed that the respondent consumed enough nutrients to meet up the recommended daily allowance for protein, carbohydrate, fat, zinc, magnesium, sodium and phosphorous requirements. The BMI classifications showed that over three-fifth of respondents were normal, while the remaining were underweight (6%) and overweight/obese (26.5%). Also, large proportion of respondents engaged in exclusive breastfeeding and with good knowledge of breastfeeding practices. Statistically, exclusive breastfeeding practices had no correlation between the BMI and frequency of breastfeeding. The study, therefore, concluded that mothers had good knowledge of breastfeeding practice; and that there was no association between breastfeeding practices and BMI.",

    "abstract": " Objectives To explore African American women\u2019s breastfeeding thoughts, attitudes, and experiences with healthcare professionals and subsequent influences on their breastfeeding interest and behavior. Insight was also sought about the most effective practices to provide breastfeeding support to African American women. Methods Thirty-eight pregnant or lactating African American women and racially diverse health professionals were recruited and participated in one of six membership specific focus groups in the metro Detroit area. An experienced focus group facilitator who was African American woman served as the primary group facilitator, using a semi-structured guide to discussions. Focus groups explored perceptions of personal and professional roles and behaviors that support African American women\u2019s breastfeeding behavior. Discussions were digitally recorded and audiotapes were transcribed. Thematic content analysis was conducted in combination with a review of field notes. Results Participants generally agreed that breastfeeding is the healthier feeding method but perceived that healthcare providers were not always fully supportive and sometimes discouraged breastfeeding. Non-breastfeeding mothers often expressed distrust of the information and recommendations given by healthcare providers and relied more on peers and relatives. Health professionals lacked information and skills to successfully engage African American women around breastfeeding. Conclusions for Practice Breastfeeding initiation and duration among African American mothers may increase when postpartum breastfeeding interventions address social and cultural challenges and when hospital breastfeeding support with the right professional lactation support, is void of unconscious bias and bridges hospital, community, peers, and family support. Professional lactation training for healthcare professionals who are in contact with expectant and new mothers and an increase in the number of IBCLC of color could help.",

    "abstract": "We assessed India's readiness to deliver infant and young child feeding (IYCF) interventions by examining elements related to policy, implementation, financing, and evidence. We based our analysis on review of (a) nutrition policy guidance and program platforms, (b) published literature on interventions to improve IYCF in India, and (c) IYCF program models implemented between 2007 and 2012. We find that Indian policies are well aligned with global technical guidance on counselling interventions. However, guidelines for complementary food supplements (CFS) need to be reexamined. Two national programs with the operational infrastructure to deliver IYCF interventions offer great potential for scale, but more operational guidance, capacity, and monitoring are needed to actively support delivery of IYCF counselling at scale by available frontline workers. Many IYCF implementation efforts to date have experimented with approaches to improve breastfeeding and initiation of complementary feeding but not with improving diet diversity or the quality of food supplements. Financing is currently inadequate to deliver CFS at scale, and governance issues affect the quality and reach of CFS. Available evidence from Indian studies supports the use of counselling strategies to improve breastfeeding practices and initiation of complementary feeding, but limited evidence exists on improving full spectrum of IYCF practices and the impact and operational aspects of CFS in India. We conclude that India is well positioned to support the full spectrum of IYCF using existing policies and delivery platforms, but capacity, financing, and evidence gaps on critical areas of programming can limit impact at scale.",

This study aimed to evaluate lifestyle, specifically eating habits and physical activity, in 5\u201315-year-olds in Spain and their health status (anthropometry). This cross-sectional population study with two time points (2006 and 2013) was conducted by compiling data from the Spanish National Health Survey. We used the minor survey, specifically the data from the Health Determinants module, which included 5\u201315-year-olds. Compiled information was obtained from parents or guardians. The overall overweight and obesity prevalence in Spain (2013) in 5- to 15-year-olds is 24.3%. A drop of 8.2% in meat consumption was found, while overall intake was high. Daily intake of plant-based food (fruit, vegetables, pulses) was low, especially vegetables (32.9%). Increased sedentary lifestyle was observed, probably because the use of communication technologies has increased in recent years ( P <0.001). Moreover, watching TV rose to 19.3% for 1 hour/day watching TV on weekdays and to 23.5% at weekends. When comparing the two time points (2006 and 2013), we observed that lifestyle, eating habits and physical activity strongly associated with the Spanish infant-juvenile population\u2019s anthropometry. Mediterranean diet patterns seem to be abandoned and physical activity is practiced less, which will have a negative impact on future quality of life.",

Questionnaires about stress responses and lifestyle were completed by 3,017 workers in a financial enterprise (41.5% men, 58.5% women). Data were collected in Japan in August 2011. Participants were classified into stress and nonstress groups. Relationships between stress responses and lifestyle were investigated using logistic regression analysis with stress response as a dependent variable. There were 254 (8.4%) participants in the stress group and 2,763 (91.6%) in the nonstress group. The results showed that sleeping for shorter periods [odds ratio (OR)\u00a0=\u00a02.97, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.58\u20135.60] was associated with stress responses in women, whereas we found no relationship between stress responses and lifestyle among men. However, working overtime was associated with stress responses in men (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.71, 95% CI: 1.43\u20135.15).

We assessed breastfeeding indicators of women with children <24 months according to The World Health Organization recommendations. Logistic regressions models of pooled data were used to estimate trends and associations with biological and sociodemographic characteristics. Between 2006 and 2018, the prevalence of ever breastfed increased from 91.8% to 94.2% ( p < 0.001), whereas early initiation of breastfeeding increased from 40.8% to 59.7% ( p < 0.001), with similar increments by urban/rural level. Between 2009 and 2018, the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding in children <6 months increased from 13.0% to 20.7% ( p < 0.001). The largest increase was seen in Mexico City, in nonindigenous women and those with a high socio\u2010economic status, whereas indigenous women and those from the South had the lowest or no improvements. Breastfeeding education during pregnancy [odds ratio (OR) 1.3; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1\u20131.5] was positively associated with exclusive breastfeeding, whereas being employed (OR 0.8; 95% CI 0.6\u20130.9) was negatively associated.

The study was also conducted to apply the information on the differences in major dish items and food groups found in this study to development of a brief food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) for children's obesity-related eating behaviors. Finally, the developed FFQ was evaluated for reliability. A total of 290, 24-hour dietary recall data from 9-11 year-old normal or obese participants in the 2001 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) were reviewed to identify dish items and food groups showing outstanding differences between the normal and obese groups. Based on the level of intake amount between the two groups, a total of 7 items, including ddeokbokggi, spaghetti, ham roast, pork cutlet, dairy products & ices, kimchi, and fruits, were selected to be included in the FFQ. The former 5 items were seen to be consumed more in the obese group, while the latter 2 items were so in the normal group. The questionnaire was formatted into a frequency response section of a seven-category option and reference period of the last 7 days. Test-retest reliability of the developed FFQ was examined by administering it to 153, 9-11 year-old children at a public elementary school in Seoul twice at a month interval. The level of reliability was found to be reasonably high. In conclusion, this study suggests that high consumption of several high-calorie dish items and low consumption of kimchi and fruits may be important eating behaviors in relation to obesity risk among 9-11 year-old children who need nutrition educators' attention. The current study also implies that a simple FFQ can be utilized to reliably assess 9-11 year-old children's diets.",

    "abstract": "Different camouflages work best with some background matching colour. Our understanding of the evolution of skin colour is based mainly on the genetics of pigmentation (\u201cbackground matching\u201d), with little known about the evolution of the neuroendocrine systems that facilitate \u201cbackground adaptation\u201d through colour phenotypic plasticity. To address the latter, we studied the evolution in vertebrates of three genes, pomc , pmch and pmchl , that code for \u03b1\u2010MSH and two melanin\u2010concentrating hormones (MCH and MCHL). These hormones induce either dispersion/aggregation or the synthesis of pigments. We find that \u03b1\u2010MSH is highly conserved during evolution, as is its role in dispersing/synthesizing pigments. Also conserved is the three\u2010exon pmch gene that encodes MCH, which participates in feeding behaviours. In contrast, pmchl (known previously as pmch ), is a teleost\u2010specific intron\u2010less gene. Our data indicate that in zebrafish, pmchl \u2010expressing neurons extend axons to the pituitary, supportive of an MCHL hormonal role, whereas zebrafish and Xenopus pmch+ neurons send axons dorsally in the brain. The evolution of these genes and acquisition of hormonal status for MCHL explain different mechanisms used by vertebrates to background\u2010adapt.",

    "abstract": "A divergent selection experiment of Muscovy sires based on the residual feed intake (RFI) of their male mule progeny was initiated in 2009. Using electronic feeders, the aim of this study was to establish whether 3 generations of selection for RFI had an impact on feeding behavior traits and general behavior, and to examine its effect on liver and meat quality. Eighty mule ducks, issued from 8 Muscovy drakes per line with extreme RFI, were tested in a pen equipped with 4 electronic feeders. Feeding behaviors were recorded from 3 to 7 wk after hatching under ad libitum feeding conditions. Then animals were prepared for overfeeding with a 3-week period of restricted feeding, and overfed during 12 d before slaughter. The RFI was significantly lower in the low RFI line than in the high RFI line (\u22125.4\u00a0g/d, P =\u00a00.0005) and daily feed intake was reduced both over the entire test period (\u22125\u00a0g/d, P = 0.049) and on a weekly basis ( P =\u00a00.006). Weekly and total feed conversion ratios were also significantly lower (\u22120.08, P = 0.03 and \u22120.06, P = 0.01, respectively). Low RFI ducks had more frequent meals, spent as much time eating as high RFI ducks, and their feeding rate was lower when analyzed at the wk level only. Additionally no significant correlation between feed efficiency and feeding behavior traits was evidenced, indicating only limited relationships between RFI and feeding patterns. Some differences in behavioral responses to stressors (open field test combined with a test measuring the response to human presence) suggested that a lower RFI is associated with less fearfulness. Selection for RFI had no effect on liver weight and quality and a slightly deleterious impact on meat quality (decreased drip loss and L*). Finally, low RFI animals had higher body weights after restricted feeding from wk 10 to wk 12 and after overfeeding than high RFI ducks. This suggests that selection for reduced RFI until 7 wk of age increases the feed efficiency up to slaughter.",

    "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa ( AN ) is a life\u2010threatening mental health condition. A core feature is a disturbance of body image, such that sufferers see themselves as fatter than they actually are. We tested the effectiveness of a novel training programme to recalibrate our participants\u2019 perception of body size. In a novel adaptation of a cognitive bias training programme, participants judged the body size of a series of female bodies and were given feedback to improve their accuracy over four daily training sessions. In Study 1, we recruited young women with high concerns about their body size for a randomized controlled study. In Study 2, we then applied the training programme to a case series of women with atypical AN . In Study 1, the training programme significantly improved the body size judgements of women with high body concerns compared to controls. We also found evidence of improved body image and reduced eating concerns in this group. In Study 2, the programme again recalibrated the body size judgements of women with atypical AN . We also saw evidence of a clinically meaningful reduction in their body size and eating\u2010disordered concerns. This training has the potential to be a valuable treatment used together with more traditional talking therapies.  Statement of contribution  What is already known on this subject?  A core feature of anorexia nervosa (AN) is an overestimation of body size; sufferers believe themselves to be larger than they are in reality. This study shows that an individual's perceptual boundary between what they classify as a fat versus a thin body is not immutable; it can be changed through a cognitive bias training programme.  What does this study add?   This means that body size overestimation may now be treatable. Critically, as well as improving the accuracy of body size judgements, we also found a clinically significant improvement in participants\u2019 eating\u2010disordered concerns. This demonstrates that a targeted behavioural training regime can change body perception, and the central role that body overestimation has in eating\u2010disordered beliefs.

This exploratory study focused on the reported heating issues that lithium-ion battery-powered pumps may have during charging compared with battery-operated pumps. It was found that pump temperature increased by 6.4\u00b0C during a long charging cycle of a lithiumion battery-operated pump under ambient temperatures. In an environmental-chamber kept at 35\u00b0C, the pump temperature increased by 4.4\u00b0C, which indicates that the pump temperature was above that of the recommended safety limit for insulin storage of 37\u00b0C. When designing new pumps, and when using currently available rechargeable pumps in warmer climates, the implications of these temperature increases should be taken into consideration. Future studies should also further examine insulin quality after charging.",

    "abstract": "The physiological functions of insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBPs) in mammals have been evaluated in several studies. However, the physiological roles of IGFBPs in chickens have not yet been elucidated. In this study, we examined the effects of short-term (6 h) fasting and refeeding on the mRNA levels of IGFBPs in chick liver and brain. Eighteen 8-day-old chicks were weighed and allocated to three groups on the basis of body weight, and subjected to ad libitum feeding, 6 h of fasting, or 6 h of fasting followed by 6 h of refeeding. After the chicks were euthanized by decapitation, the liver and brain were excised, and the brain was dissected into six segments (telencephalon, optic lobes, cerebellum, rostral part of the brainstem, middle part of the brainstem, and caudal part of the brainstem). IGFBP mRNA levels were determined by qRT-PCR. Fasting significantly increased the mRNA levels of IGFBP-1 and -2 in the chick liver, and these changes were reversed by 6 h of refeeding. The mRNA levels of IGFBP-3 in the middle part of the brainstem and IGFBP-5 in the optic lobes were decreased by 6 h of fasting and were not reversed after 6 h of refeeding. These findings suggest that IGFBP-1 and -2 in the liver, IGFBP-3 in the middle part of the brainstem, and IGFBP-5 in the optic lobes may play physiological roles in response to short-term changes in the nutritional status of chicks.",

    "abstract": "The effects of dietary additives and holding time on resistance and resilience of broiler chickens to Clostridium perfringens challenge were investigated by offering four dietary treatments. These were a negative control (basal), a positive control (Zn-bacitracin) and two dietary additives, mannanoligosaccharides (MOS), and acidifier. Two holding times included (a) immediate access to feed and water post hatch (FED) and (b) access to both feed and water 48 h post hatch (HELD). Chicks fed Zn-bacitracin had no intestinal lesions attributed to necrotic enteritis (NE), whereas chicks fed both MOS or acidifier showed signs of NE related lesions. All dietary treatments were effective in reducing the numbers of C. perfringens in the ileum post challenge. The FED chicks had heavier body weight and numerically lower mortality. The FED chicks also showed stronger immune responses to NE challenge, showing enhanced (p<0.05) proliferation of T-cells. Early feeding of the MOS supplemented diet increased (p<0.05) IL-6 production. The relative bursa weight of the FED chicks was heavier at d 21 (p<0.05). All the additives increased the relative spleen weight of the HELD chicks at d 14 (p<0.05). The FED chicks had increased villus height and reduced crypt depth, and hence an increased villus/crypt ratio, especially in the jejunum at d 14 (p<0.05). The same was true for the HELD chicks given dietary additives (p<0.05). It may be concluded that the chicks with early access to dietary additives showed enhanced immune response and gut development, under C. perfringens challenge. The findings of this study shed light on managerial and nutritional strategies that could be used to prevent NE in the broiler industry without the use of in-feed antibiotics.",

WHO, UNICEF, and OECD report the breastfeeding rate (BR) and exclusive breastfeeding rate (EBR) at 3, 4, and 6 months of age for the international comparison. This article investigates the nationwide changes in BR and EBR in Korea from 1994 to 2012. EBR declined from 1994 to 2000, however progressively increased untill 2012. The latest data in 2012 revealed EBRs at 3, 4, and 6 months were 50.0%, 40.5%, and 11.4% respectively. The exclusive formula feeding rate (EFR) was highest in 2000 and gradually declined thereafter. In 2012, the EFRs at 3, 4 and 6 months were 21.7%, 26.5%, and 10.1%. In 2009, the EBRs at 3 and 6 months in the United States were 36.0% and 16.3% compared to 50.0% and 11.4% in Korea. In England, the EBRs were 17% and 12% in 2010. Amongst OECD countries, Hungary ranked highest EBRwith 95%, and Iceland, Norway, Slovak Republic, Australia, New Zealand followed. In conclusion, BRs were lowest in 2000, and there have been remarkable increases in BRs over the past 10 yr in Korea. Although BRs have been increasing, further efforts to increase BRs should be made continuously.",

The precise mechanism of EDs is still unclear and the disorders cause remarkable agony for the patients and their families. Although there are many available treatment methods for EDs today, such as family therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, medication, psychotherapy, and so on, almost half of the patients are refractory to all current medical treatment and never fully recover. For treatment-refractory EDs, stereotactic surgery may be an alternative therapy. This review discusses the history of stereotactic surgery, the modern procedures, and the mostly used targets of stereotactic surgery in EDs. In spite of the limited application of stereotactic surgery in ED nowadays, stereotactic lesion and deep brain stimulation (DBS) are promising treatments with the development of modern functional imaging techniques and the increasing understanding of its mechanism in the future.",

There is now a growing evidence that breastfeeding has short- and long-term health benefits for mothers with GDM. Mothers with GDM who breastfeed have improved lipid and glucose metabolic profiles for the first 3 months after birth. However, women with GDM are less likely to breastfeed and, if they do, breastfeeding is usually continued for a shorter duration compared with women without GDM. One long-term prospective study followed women with GDM from delivery for up to 19 years postpartum, and found that breastfeeding for \u22653 months reduced the risk of T2DM and delayed the development of T2DM by a further 10 years compared with breastfeeding for <3 months. However, the physiological mechanisms underlying the protective effects of breastfeeding are still unknown, even though it is important to gain a full understanding of the pathways involved in these effects. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the recent developments in the field of GDM and breastfeeding.

Although several measures have been taken to comply with the WHO guidelines, newborn feeding malpractices are widely seen in Ethiopia. To assess the prevalence and determinant of early days of newborn feeding malpractices among recently delivered women in Mizan-Aman Town, southwestern Ethiopia, 2020. A community-based cross-sectional study of recently delivered women was conducted between March 5/2020 and April 8/2020. A total of 487 mother-to-child (<12month) pairs were selected using a multi-stage randomized sampling technique and the data were collected through a face-to-face interview using a structured questionnaire. The result was analyzed via SPSS version 26. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the determinant of newborn feeding malpractices and a p<0.05 was deemed to be significant. Prevalence of prelacteal feeding, delayed initiation of breastfeeding and colostrum avoidance was approximately 21.9%, 35.5% and 15.5%, respectively. The most common prelacteal food was Rue/\u201cTenadam\u201d/49 (10.1%). The key reasons for this were: 49 (10.1%) Cultural activity followed by 45 (9.3%) intestinal/ghost/birth clean-ups. Determinants of prelacteal feeding were found to be: mothers who recognize the risks of prelactate feeding, multipara mothers, had \u22654 children and infants birth order between 4 and 6. Likewise, exposure to infant formula advertising, absence of home-to-home health education, multipara mothers and spontaneous vaginal birth were the determinants of colostrum avoidance. The study found that one in four and one-third of newborns had experience with prelacteal and delayed breastfeeding, respectively. This makes the newborn feeding practice suboptimal in the city. As a result, behavioral modification programs on the prevention of prelacteal feeding and enhancement of early initiation of colostrum feeding practices are recommended.",

Antidepressants were the most commonly prescribed psychotropic medication. New ED presentations in primary care are reducing. Understanding the cause of this decrease (coding behaviours, changes in help-seeking or a genuine reduction in new cases) is important to plan services, allocate resources and deliver effective care.",

    "abstract": "Binge-watching (i.e.,\u00a0watching multiple episodes of a TV series in one session) has recently become standard practice among TV series viewers; this expansion generates concerns regarding the potential negative outcomes associated with this habit. However, the investigation of its psychological correlates remains fragmentary, with few initial studies a priori conceptualizing this behavior as a new addictive disorder. This study explored these psychological correlates using cluster analysis of binge-watching behavior based on three key psychological factors: motivations, impulsivity, and emotional reactivity. An online survey was completed by 4,039 TV series viewers. Data were analyzed using hierarchical and non-hierarchical cluster analyses, the validity of the clusters being finally determined through mutual comparisons with a selection of external correlates. Four clusters were identified: recreational TV series viewers (presenting low involvement in binge-watching), regulated binge-watchers (moderately involved), avid binge-watchers (presenting elevated but non-problematic involvement), and unregulated binge-watchers (presenting potentially problematic involvement associated with negative outcomes). This study underlines the heterogeneous and multidetermined nature of binge-watching. Our findings suggest that high engagement in binge-watching is distinct from problematic binge-watching, thus reinforcing the notion that conceptualizing binge-watching as an addictive disorder is of low relevance and might actually lead to the overpathologization of this highly popular leisure activity.",

The prognosis of patients with SER treated with surgical intervention or the traditional \u201cthree-tube\u201d method is controversial. Thus, the aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy, feasibility, and safety of a new \u201ctwo-tube\u201d method involving a trans-fistula drainage tube and a three-lumen jejunal feeding tube for the treatment of SER without concomitant pleural rupture. From January 2007 to June 2016, patients with SER and managed with the \u201ctwo-tube\u201d method or other methods were retrospectively analyzed. Data collected included initial presentation, procedure time, duration of treatment, numbers of patients with eventual healing of leaks, and complications. The average procedure time for the \u201ctwo-tube\u201d method was 22.1\u2009\u00b1\u20095.5 minutes. In comparison with the control method, the \u201ctwo-tube\u201d method had a similar diagnosis time (3.6\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4 vs. 3.4\u2009\u00b1\u20091.4 days) but a significantly higher successful closure rate (94.4% vs. 63.6%) and shorter treatment time (38.2\u2009\u00b1\u20095.6 vs. 53.6\u2009\u00b1\u200916.9 days). No complications associated with performance of the \u201ctwo-tube\u201d method occurred. The \u201ctwo-tube\u201d method is an effective and safe approach for patients with SER.",

Nonetheless, how crossbreds with different fractional genetic proportions respond to such circumstances is of interest. A study to examine the physiological responses to cutaneous evaporative heat loss, also lactation period and milk yield, were conducted in Sahiwal ( Bos indicus , n = 10, 444\u00b164.8 kg, 9\u00b12.9 years), Holstein Friesian ( Bos taurus , HF100% (n = 10, 488\u00b197.9 kg, 6\u00b12.8 years)) and the following crossbreds: HF50% (n = 10, 355\u00b140.7 kg, 2\u00b10 years) and HF87.5% (n = 10, 489\u00b176.8 kg, 7\u00b11.8 years). They were allocated so as to determine the physiological responses of sweating rate (SR), respiration rate (RR), rectal temperature (RT), and skin temperature (ST) with and without hair from 06:00 h am to 15:00 h pm. And milk yield during 180 days were collected at days from 30 to 180. The ambient temperature-humidity-index (THI) increased from less than 80 in the early morning to more than 90 in the late afternoon. The interaction of THI and breed were highly affected on SR, RR, RT, and ST (p<0.01). The SR was highest in Sahiwal (595 g/m 2 /h) compared to HF100% (227 g/m 2 /h), and their crossbreds both HF50% (335 g/m 2 /h) and HF87.5% (299 g/m 2 /h). On the other hand, RR was higher in HF87.5% (54 bpm) and both HF100% (48 bpm) and HF50% (42 bpm) than Sahiwal (25 bpm) (p<0.01). The RT showed no significant differences as a result of breed (p>0.05) but did change over time. The ST with and without hair were similar, and was higher in HF100% (37.4\u00b0C; 38.0\u00b0C) and their crossbred HF50% (35.5\u00b0C; 35.5\u00b0C) and HF87.5% (37.1\u00b0C; 37.9\u00b0C) than Sahiwal (34.8\u00b0C; 34.8\u00b0C) (p<0.01). Moreover, the early lactation were higher at HF100% (25 kg) and 87.5% (25 kg) than HF50% (23 kg) which were higher than Sahiwal (18 kg) while the peak period of lactation was higher at HF100% (35 kg) than crossbreds both HF87.5% and HF50% (32 kg) which was higher than Sahiwal (26 kg) (p<0.05). In conclusion, sweating and respiration were the main vehicle for dissipating excess body heat for Sahiwal, HF and crossbreds, respectively. The THI at 76 to 80 were the critical points where the physiological responses to elevated temperature displayed change.",

Anxiety, depression and ED symptoms were measured at four time points: first/second trimester, third trimester, 8\u2009weeks and 6\u2009months postpartum. Linear mixed effects models were used to test for group differences. Women with C-ED and P-ED, in all diagnostic categories, had significantly higher levels of psychopathology at all time points. ED symptoms decreased in the C-ED group, compared with an overall increase in the other two groups but subsequently increased after pregnancy. Overall, depression and state and trait anxiety scores decreased in the C-ED group compared with the HC group throughout the antenatal and postnatal periods. High levels of psychopathology are common throughout the antenatal and postnatal periods among women with current and past ED, and despite some overall reductions, symptoms remain clinically significant. \u00a9 2014 The Authors.

We describe herein a case in which the development of zolpidem-induced sleep-related eating disorder (SRED) and SRCB was strongly suspected. A 71-year-old Korean male was admitted to the Department of Psychiatry due to his repetitive SRED and SRCB with anterograde amnesia, which he reported as having occurred since taking zolpidem. The patient also had restless legs syndrome (RLS) and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). His baseline serum iron level was low at admission. Zolpidem discontinuation resulted in the immediate disappearance of his SRED, but did not affect his RLS symptoms. These symptoms rapidly improved after adding a single i.v. iron injection once daily, and so he was discharged to day-clinic treatment. These findings indicate that zolpidem can induce SRCB. Although the pathophysiology of zolpidem-induced SRED and other SRCB remains unclear, clinicians should carefully monitor for the potential induction of complex behaviors associated with zolpidem in patients with comorbid RLS or OSA.",

Despite the fact that a huge body of research has carefully examined the possible risk factors associated with the eating disorders, they have failed not only to uncover the exact etiology of eating disorders, but also to understand the interaction between different causes of eating disorders. This failure may be due complexities of eating disorders, limitations of the studies or combination of two factors.

The underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown but may include the epigenetic disruption of gene activity during development. Alcohol directly activates the neurotransmitter dopamine, which plays an essential role in neurodevelopment. To investigate whether antenatal and early postnatal alcohol consumption were associated with differential dopamine receptor DRD4 promoter methylation in infants ( n =  844). Data were drawn from the large population based Triple B pregnancy cohort study, with detailed information on maternal alcohol consumption in each trimester of pregnancy and early postpartum. DNA was extracted from infant buccal swabs collected at 8-weeks. DRD4 promoter DNA methylation was analysed by Sequenom MassARRAY. No strong evidence was found for an association between alcohol consumption during pregnancy and infant DRD4 methylation at 8-weeks postpartum. However, maternal alcohol consumption assessed contemporaneously at 8-weeks postpartum was associated with increased methylation at 13 of 19 CpG units examined (largest \u0394\u2009+\u20093.20%, 95%Confidence Interval:1.66,4.75%, P =\u20090.0001 at CpG.6).

    "abstract": "Regulation of feeding is essential for animal survival. The pharyngeal sense organs can act as a second checkpoint of food quality, due to their position between external taste organs such as the labellum which initially assess food quality, and the digestive tract. Growing evidence provides support that the pharyngeal sensory neurons regulate feeding, but much is still unknown. We found that a pair of gustatory receptor neurons in the LSO, a Drosophila adult pharyngeal organ which expresses four gustatory receptors, is involved in feeding inhibition in response to high concentrations of sodium ions. RNAi experiments and mutant analysis showed that the gustatory receptor Gr2a is necessary for this process. This feeding preference determined by whether a food source is perceived as appetizing or not is influenced by nutritional conditions, such that when the animal is hungry, the need for energy dominates over how appealing the food source is. Our results provide experimental evidence that factors involved in feeding function in a context-dependent manner.",

In a retrospective analysis, challenges were noticed in the form of delayed first milk expression and frequency of expression, which was limited to 2\u20133 times a day. A quality improvement initiative was designed to increase the exclusive breast milk feeding rates in admitted preterm babies. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the proportion of preterm neonates receiving mother's own milk by day 7 of life after such an initiative. The quality improvement initiative was conducted at a level 3 neonatal intensive care unit from May 10, 2018, to August 10, 2018. Inborn preterm neonates <34 weeks with a minimum hospital stay of 7 days were included. Neonates of critically sick mothers and neonates having major congenital malformations were excluded. Mothers were given structured antenatal counseling regarding expressing breast milk (EBM). Postnatal visits were conducted to provide information through a video and a leaflet and formation of breastfeeding support group. A total of 30 babies were recruited during a period of 3 months and compared to historical controls. The median age of the first EBM improved from 2.5 days to 1.16 days, and the amount of EBM on the first day improved from 0.24\u202fml to 2.6\u202fml ( p =\u202f.002). The proportion of babies receiving EBM on the first day improved from 24% to 80% ( p =\u202f.0001), and at the end of 7 days, it increased to 73% from 46% ( p =\u202f.02). The factors time to reach full enteral feeds, time to regain birth weight, rate of necrotizing enterocolitis, rate of sepsis, and proportion of babies on exclusive mother's milk during discharge appear comparable in both the groups. A simple quality improvement approach through the formation of breastfeeding support group, antenatal counseling, and postnatal support for breast milk expression has made a significant improvement in milk expression from mothers delivered prematurely. It reflects on a team approach using the available resources.",

A representative sample of 1943 adolescents living in Victoria in 1992. Teen drinking was assessed at 6 monthly intervals (5 waves) between mean ages 14.9 and 17.4\u2005years and summarised across waves as none, one, or two or more waves of: (1) frequent drinking (3+ days in the past week), (2) loss of control over drinking (difficulty stopping, amnesia), (3) binge drinking (5+ standard drinks in a day) and (4) heavy binge drinking (20+ and 11+ standard drinks in a day for males and females, respectively). Young Adult Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) was assessed at 3 yearly intervals (3 waves) across the 20s (mean ages 20.7 through 29.1\u2005years). We show that patterns of teen drinking characterised by loss of control increase risk for AUD across young adulthood: loss of control over drinking (one wave OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.8; two or more waves OR 1.9, CI 1.4 to 2.7); binge drinking (one wave OR 1.7, CI 1.3 to 2.3; two or more waves OR 2.0, CI 1.5 to 2.6), and heavy binge drinking (one wave OR 2.0, CI 1.4 to 2.8; two or more waves OR 2.3, CI 1.6 to 3.4). This is not so for frequent drinking, which was unrelated to later AUD. Although drinking was more common in males, there was no evidence of sex differences in risk relationships. Our results extend previous work by showing that patterns of drinking that represent loss of control over alcohol consumption (however expressed) are important targets for intervention. In addition to current policies that may reduce overall consumption, emphasising prevention of more extreme teenage bouts of alcohol consumption appears warranted.",

A total of 83 gilts (Yorkshire\u00d7Landrace) were housed into individual stalls to be artificially inseminated. Gilts confirmed pregnant were introduced to their treatment, conventional stalls (ST) or groups with the ESF system. All gilts were taken to the farrowing crates one week prior to their expected farrowing date. In the gestation period, there were no significant differences between gilts allocated to ST and ESF on growth performance. However, backfat thickness gain (p = 0.08) and body condition score (BCS) at 110 days of gestation (p = 0.10) tended to be higher in ESF gilts than ST. Likewise, gilts housed in group showed significantly higher estimated body muscle contents at 110 days of gestation (p = 0.02) and body muscle change during gestation (p = 0.01). There was a trend for a shorter parturition time in ESF gilts (p = 0.07). In the lactation period, group housed gilts showed a tendency to increased BCS changes (p = 0.06). Reproductive performance did not differ with the exception of piglet mortality (ST = 0.2 no. of piglets vs ESF = 0.4 no. of piglets; p = 0.01). In blood profiles, ST gilts showed a higher cortisol level at 110 days of gestation (p = 0.01). Weaning to estrus interval was shorter in gilts housed in ESF than ST (p = 0.01). In locomotory behaviors, ESF gilts recorded a tendency to elevate locomotion score at 36, 70, and 110 days of gestation (p = 0.07, p = 0.06, and p = 0.06, respectively).

Moreover, farrowing rates were higher in stall treatment (97.6%) compare to group housing treatment (95.2%). In conclusion, while group housed gilts with ESF system positively affected welfare status in combination with less physiologically stressful environments and activity, it negatively effects piglet mortality, farrowing rates and injuries of gilts.",

Moreover, women who reported higher level of restraint or regular binge eating episodes obtained higher score on the CIA than women who did not have such behaviors across the same period. This study provided preliminary support for the reliability and validity of the Persian version of the EDE-Q and CIA. The obtained norms for the EDE-Q and the CIA are helpful in clinical practice and intercultural studies of eating disorders.",

The pandemic threatens millions of children and adolescents and their families currently living with or at risk for development of food insecurity. The lack of consistent access to nutritious food sources is associated with chronic physical and mental health problems and death. Studies on food insecurity and eating pathology have heightened our concern about the impact the added effect of the pandemic may have on eating behaviors of children and adolescents.

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to investigate changes in dietary intake and appetite across the menopausal transition. This was a 5-year observational, longitudinal study on the menopausal transition. The study included 94 premenopausal women at baseline (age: 49.9 \u00b1 1.9 yrs; BMI: 23.3 \u00b1 2.3 kg/m 2 ). Body composition (DXA), appetite (visual analogue scale), eating frequency, energy intake (EI) and macronutrient composition (7-day food diary and buffet-type meal) were measured annually. Repeated-measures analyses revealed that total EI and carbohydrate intake from food diary decreased significantly over time in women who became postmenopausal by year 5 ( P > 0.05) compared to women in the menopausal transition. In women who became postmenopausal by year 5, fat and protein intakes decreased across the menopausal transition (0.05 > P < 0.01). Although a decrease in % fat intake was observed during the menopausal transition ( P < 0.05), this variable was significantly increased in the postmenopausal years ( P < 0.05). Spontaneous EI and protein intake also declined over time and were higher in the years preceding menopause onset ( P < 0.05). Desire to eat, hunger and prospective food consumption increased during the menopausal transition and remained at this higher level in the postmenopausal years (0.05 > P < 0.001). Fasting fullness decreased across the menopausal transition ( P < 0.05). These results suggest that menopausal transition is accompanied with a decrease in food intake and an increase in appetite.",

We examined students\u2019 adherence to recommended guidelines, and the associations between importance of eating healthy and guidelines adherence. A total of 3271 undergraduates at 11 faculties, Assiut University, Egypt (2009\u20132010), completed a questionnaire reporting their consumption of 12 food groups; number of servings of fruits/vegetables/day; and how important it is for them to eat healthy. We employed the WHO guidelines for the Eastern Mediterranean region (WHO 2012) to compute students\u2019 adherence to dietary guidelines for the different food groups. Chi-square tested the differences for adherence to guidelines by gender, and the associations between the importance of healthy eating and guidelines adherence for the whole sample and by gender. Except for cereal products, no food group had an adherence level >45%. Gender differences were observed (men had better adherence for sweets, cake/cookies, snacks, and raw vegetables but not for fast food/canned food or cooked vegetables, P < 0.001 for each). There was a significant positive trend between the increase of subjective importance of eating healthy and adherence to guidelines ( P = 0.012\u2013< 0.001). However, this association was only for some food groups and gender dependent. Across the majority of food groups we examined, this sample exhibited low adherence levels to International Nutrition Guidelines. Healthier eating educational/intervention efforts should target foods exhibiting low adherence (most food groups, particularly salad/raw vegetables, fresh fruits, dairy/dairy products, meat/sausage products); consider gender differences (females reported lower adherence across most food groups); and note the relation between adherence and subjective importance of eating healthy by food groups and gender.",

Ten nurses and 4 babies were paired to form 40 nurse-baby pairs for the study. Forty feeding events in each groups were recorded. The median duration of feeding in the feed rail group was 18.5\u00a0min compared to 15\u00a0min in nurse-led feeding ( p =\u20090.34). Feeding rate corrected for bodyweight ranged between 0.8 and 2.3\u00a0mL/kg/min in the feed\u00a0rail group compared to 2.5 and 8.9\u00a0mL/kg/min in the control (manual gravity feed) group.

The task of scaling improved nutrition services now turns to addressing progress on the regional level. This research sought to highlight regional disparities identified in scaling nutrition services for child nutrition in Ethiopia, by identifying variations in early breastfeeding and child feeding practices and associated socio-demographic characteristics by geographic area in four regions of the country. The cross-sectional study data derived from an evaluation of nutrition services and programming and included 1299 participants, of whom 50% reported practicing recommended early breastfeeding practices. This varied from less than 8% in one zone of Afar region to 84% in a zone of Tigray, with differences also noted by socio-demographic characteristics. Among the total sample, 70% of respondents met the recommendation for minimum number of feedings per day, and 16% met the recommendation for dietary diversity. Less than 8% of families in the service population in Northwestern Tigray zone met the dietary diversity recommendation compared to 36% in South Wollo, Amhara region. Utilizing regional and zonal data will allow for government and other agencies involved in improving nutrition and health outcomes to appropriately provide services and programs for families and children over the life course.

    "abstract": "According to a recent consensus, the cachectic syndrome is defined as: \u201c\u2026 a complex metabolic syndrome associated with underlying illness and characterized by loss of muscle with or without loss of fat mass. The prominent clinical feature of cachexia is weight loss in adults (corrected for fluid retention) or growth failure in children (excluding endocrine disorders). Anorexia, inflammation, insulin resistance, and increased muscle protein breakdown are frequently associated with cachexia.\u201d Although this definition is accompanied by diagnostic criteria, it does not consider the problem of staging. Stratification of patients is important when considering therapy. The very first stage of the wasting syndrome does not necessarily involve body weight loss\u2014a state known as pre-cachexia. The aim of the present score was to overcome the problem of patient staging in cancer. This score considers five main different factors: body weight and lean body mass loss; anorexia; inflammatory, immunological, and metabolic disturbances; physical performance; and quality of life. The scoring scale goes from 0 to 100: mild cachexia (less than 25), moderate (more than 26 and less than 50), severe (more than 51 and less than 75), and terminal phase (more than 76 and up to 100). The score also takes into consideration the condition known as pre-cachexia. The present score will facilitate cachexia staging and will therefore allow for a more adequate therapy.

All patients that had narrow-bore enteral feeding tubes inserted over a 2-year period (1993-1995) were included. The study required no clinical interventions. Seven hundred and forty feeding tubes were inserted during the study period. In 14 cases (2%), the feeding tube was inserted into the tracheopulmonary system. Five patients (0.7%) suffered a major complication, including two (0.3%) who died from complications directly related to the feeding tube placement. All patients had altered consciousness and 13 of the 14 had endotracheal tubes in place. Malposition of the feeding tube was not predictable from clinical signs and auscultation, but was detectable by chest roentgenogram. Inadvertent insertion of enteral feeding tubes into the tracheopulmonary system during placement is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Clinical signs at the time of insertion are not useful in identifying feeding tubes which are malpositioned. In the ICU patient, a chest roentgenogram is required after all feeding tube insertions prior to the initiation of enteral feeding. In the high-risk patient, alternatives to blind feeding tube insertion should be considered.",

    "abstract": "To examine how self-reported and behavioural impulsivity are related in anorexia nervosa (AN). Twenty-four females with AN and 25 healthy controls (HC) participant in the study. Self-reported impulsivity was assessed with the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11). The scale yields three second-order factors: Attentional, motor and non-planning. Behavioural impulsivity was investigated with the continuous performance test (CPT), a computer-based task of sustained attention in which numbers are flashed briefly on screen and participants are required to click the mouse when the same number appears consecutively. The rate of commission and omission errors can be used a measure of behavioural imulsivity. AN participants self-reported increased attentional [AN: 20.67 (3.64), HC: 13.88 (2.91), P = 0.001] and reduced motor impulsivity [AN: 11.55 (2.28), HC: 14.08 (2.78), P = 0.002]. The rate of omission or commission errors on the CPT did not differ between groups ( P > 0.05). BIS-11 and CPT measures did not significantly correlate, but attentional impulsivity was related to negative mood states in AN (depression: r = 0.52, P = 0.010, anxiety: r = 0.55, P = 0.006, stress: r = 0.57, P = 0.004). The discrepancy between self-reported and behavioural impulsivity are discussed in terms of perfectionism in AN. Furthermore, it is suggested that improving negative mood states may resolve this inconsistency in AN.",

To systematically review the available global literature on the frequency of lactational mastitis, and to summarize the evidence on risk factors for lactational mastitis. We also describe gaps in the evidence and identify priority areas for future research. We systematically searched and screened 6 databases and included 26 articles, conducted meta-analysis of disease frequency, and narratively synthesized evidence on risk factors. In 11 (42%) articles researchers reported a measure of disease frequency; 5 (19%) reported risk factors, and 10 (39%) included both. Overall, the quality of studies was low, related to suboptimal measurement of disease frequency, high risk of bias, reverse causality, and incomplete adjustment for confounding. Meta-analysis was based on 3 studies (pooled incidence between birth and Week 25 postpartum: 11.1 episodes per 1,000 breastfeeding weeks; 95% CI [10.2\u201312.0]); with high heterogeneity across contexts and highest incidence in the first four weeks postpartum. Researchers assessed 42 potential risk factors; nipple damage was the most frequently studied and strongly associated with mastitis. There was a scarcity of studies from low-resource settings. Lactational mastitis is a common condition, but the wide variability in incidence across contexts suggested that a substantial portion of this burden might be preventable. Provision of care to breastfeeding women at risk for or affected by mastitis is currently constrained due to a critical lack of high quality epidemiological evidence about its incidence and risk factors.",

Prospective cohort study. This prospective, longitudinal study was conducted from December 2013 to September 2015 at two healthcare facilities (BFHI and non-BFHI) in Riyadh Saudi Arabia. Women 36\u201340\u2005weeks gestation receiving antenatal care at the hospitals were enrolled. Questionnaires were administered prenatally, at 1, 3 and 6\u2005months postnatal and to the administrator and maternity staff. We recruited 277 women with an estimated 80% response rate. 156 (BFHI=78/139, non-BFHI=78/138, 56%) participants completed all questionnaires. Most BFHI-hospital participants (77.9%, n=8 for this question) acknowledged seeing the breast feeding policy compared to 23.5% (n=23) at the non-BFHI-hospital (p<0.01). Breast feeding education and encouragement was higher at the BFHI-hospital (93.3%) compared to the non-BFHI-hospital (48.2%; p<0.01). At postpartum discharge, 51% (n=53) of mothers in the BFHI-hospital were breast feeding exclusively versus 29.6% (n=29) at the non-BFHI-hospital. Where formula feed was introduced, women in the BFHI-hospital more often practiced mixed feeding rather than exclusive formula feeding with some switching from mixed feeding to exclusive breast feeding between 3 and 6\u2005months postpartum. Exclusive breast feeding rates declined in both hospitals at 3 and 6\u2005months postpartum with lack of community services for lactation being a major reason. Although BFHI-hospital staff (n=9) were more conversant with BFHI principles, defects in adherence to the BFHI 10 Steps were identified. This is the first study assessing the effectiveness of BFHI implementation in Saudi Arabia. Although women reported increased breast feeding rates, we identified important weaknesses that could be improved through strict compliance with BFHI practices.",

The structure of amorphous Ni material determined through the radial distribution function, the total energy, the size and the average coordination number. The phase transition and the glass transition temperature determined through the relationship between the total energy and temperature. The result shows that when the heating rate increases, the first peak's position for the radial distribution function is 2.45 \u00c5 and a constant, the first peak's height, the total energy and the size increase, the average coordination number decreases from 13 to 12. When temperature increases from 300 to 1000 K at P = 0 GPa, the position decreases from 2.45 \u00c5 to 2.40 \u00c5, the average coordination number is 13 and a constant, glass transition temperature is 631 K, the total energy increases, the size increases and happens the phase transition from the amorphous state to the liquid state. When pressure increases from 0 GPa to 5 GPa at T = 300, 621 and 900 K, the position decreases, the height increases, the total energy increases, the size decreases, the average coordination number decreases from 13 to 12, that shows with amorphous Ni material when increasing heating rate, T, P lead to structural change, phase transition of materials is significant.

    "abstract": "Breastfeeding provides an unequalled way of infant nutrition, despite that, the rate of exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months in Egypt is only 13%, and the rates of artificial feeding are rising. The current study aimed to explore the reasons for the use of artificial feeding among mothers receiving subsidised milk from formula dispensing centres in Egypt, and to detect the reasons behind the use of a formula only for infant feeding rather than mixed breastfeeding and artificial feeding. This exploratory cross-sectional study involved 197 mothers; who attended centres for dispensing subsidised artificial formula at primary health care facilities (PHC) in El-Fayom and Ismailia governorates via a purposive sampling technique. The study spanned over 6-months duration from June till December 2018. A statistically significant higher percentage of artificial feeding only was noticed in male infants (47.5% in the AF group only versus 28.7% in the mixed feeding group (p = 0.018), and infants aged 6-12 months (47.5% in the AF group only versus 28.7% in the mixed feeding group, p = 0.032). A statistically significant higher percentage of artificial feeding only was noticed among infants born to mothers who have general anaesthesia during labour (67.2% in the AF group only versus 41.9% in the mixed feeding group, p = 0.004), and among infants born to mothers who think that formula feeding is better (13.1% in the AF group only versus 0.7% in the mixed feeding group, or that formula has a similar quality to breast milk (6.6%% in the AF group only versus 4.4% in the mixed feeding group, p = 0.0004. The most common reasons for formula feeding reported by both groups were perceived breast milk insufficiency (60.9%), weak babies (50.3%), and doctors\u2019 advice (37%). Previous negative breastfeeding experience and the need for own body privacy were the two reasons which differed statistically in both groups p = 0.004 and 0.008, respectively. Antenatal care education is essential to improve mothers\u2019 knowledge and practice of breastfeeding. Baby-friendly hospital initiative implementation is essential to ensure early initiation and continuation of breastfeeding.",

The 1 + grade Hanwoo LT muscles were measured for marbling fleck morphology at the 13 th thoracic vertebrae location by using computerized image analysis. Results reveal that both marbling groups had similar proximate composition (protein, fat, moisture and collagen), color and technological quality traits (p>0.05). However, the coarse marbling group presented greater C18:2n6 and polyunsaturated fatty acids contents compared to the fine marbling group (p<0.05). Furthermore, the fine marbling group presented lower volatile basic nitrogen (VBN) and 2-thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) contents compared to the coarse marbling group after 14 d storage (p<0.05). Also, higher amounts of C18:2n6 oxidation-derived volatile compounds such as hexanal and 3-ethyl-2-methyl-1,3-hexadiene, were found in the coarse marbling group. In term of sensory aspects, the finely-marbled group received higher scores of flavor and taste compared to the coarse marbling group (p<0.05). Overall, the marbling flecks morphology partially showed its effects on the storage stability, fatty acids profile and eating quality of the 1 + grade Hanwoo beef LT muscle.",

The recognition of its functional receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), have facilitated the antivirus drugs testing and vaccines development. Due to the natural resistance of mouse model to SARS-Cov-2, there is an urgent need to find out the alternative animal model. Considering the crucial role of ACE2 in the host cell entry, we analyzed the phylogeny and expression pattern of ACE2 from various mammals. Firstly, crab-eating macaque possesses all of the 5 identical hotspot residues with human, suggesting high likelihood of interaction between ACE2 and spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 to occur. Cattle and pig show 4 identical sites. Ferret, cat and dog possess 3 identical sites. Bat and mouse only share 2 same amino acids with human. Secondly, in humans, ACE2 is widely present, with particularly high expression in adipose, thyroid, lung and colon tissues. In crab-eating macaque, liver, lung, thyroid and colon showed high expression level of ACE2. For dog, ACE2 is most highly expressed in colon with obvious differential expression level between female and male group. The results would provide clues for establishing the appropriate animal model in the research and clinical cure of COVID-19.

Identifying and addressing this disorder in patients with T2DM is a significant challenge for health-care providers. The purpose of this narrative review is to discuss current perspectives on BED in the context of T2DM with implications for screening and management of these highly comorbid conditions. BED continues to be underrecognized and underdiagnosed. However, there are established tools that providers can use to screen for BED such as the SCOFF Questionnaire and Questionnaire on Eating and Weight Patterns-5. There are several effective treatments for BED including cognitive behavioral therapy, interpersonal therapy, and lisdexamfetamine dimesylate. However, few studies have examined the effects of these treatments in patients with co-morbid T2DM and BED.",

Microplastics contamination of food webs can be approached as part of estuarine ecosystem ecology. Standard sampling designs to study estuarine ecology allow comparisons along time and across space. The proposed methods detect shifts in fish feeding habit and to demonstrate the diversity of interactions among pollutant, environment and biota. The aim was to describe a methodology developed to study the relationship among the spatio-temporal patterns of habitat utilization, feeding ecology and microplastics (MPs) contamination across the different ontogenetic phases of fishes belonging to different trophic levels and living along the riverine-estuarine-coastal food web. The Goiana Estuary\u2018s water column was examined for the seasonal and spatial variation of MPs and their quantification relative to zooplankton, demersal fish species contamination following the same sampling design. The density of MPs in the water column determines their bioavailability. Interest in studies on MPs distribution in relation to spatial and temporal variation of environmental factors and fauna are increasing in quantity and quality. If the ecological strategies presented in this study were replicated in other estuary, comparisons could be made in order to describe how ecosystems work. Standard protocols for sampling, extraction, enumeration and classification of MPs and others pollutant ingested by fishes have been developed and are presented here to encourage comparisons. Standardized and comparable sampling designs and laboratory procedures are an important strategy in order to devise and transfer managerial solutions among different sites and comparisons along time when studying the same environment.

However, one of the common unwanted effects is excessive sweating or hyperhidrosis. Oxybutynin is an anticholinergic medication which reduces sweating. The aim of this double-blind study was to examine the effect of administration of oxybutynin on subjective sweating in patients treated with sertraline. A total of 140 patients experiencing a major depressive disorder (mean age 37.69 \u00b1 10.44 years, 86 females [61.4%]) treated with sertraline (mean dose 83 mg/day) were consecutively enrolled in the study, and all reported excessive sweating as a side effect. Thereafter, the patients were randomly assigned to either an oxybutynin 5 mg/day group or to a placebo group. At the beginning and end of the 2-week trial, the patients completed questionnaires related to sweating and medication-related side effects. Over time, subjective sweating reduced significantly in the treatment group as compared with the control group. Oxybutynin-induced side effects were uncommon. Relative to male patients, female patients reported less subjective sweating. Administration of oxybutynin successfully reduced excessive sweating in patients experiencing a major depressive disorder and treated with sertraline.

The aim of this paper is to describe risk factors for ceasing breastfeeding and methods of feeding until 12\u00a0months postnatal age in mothers who breastfed their preterm infants at discharge from neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). The data come from a randomised controlled trial, which evaluated the effectiveness on exclusive breastfeeding at 8\u00a0weeks of proactive telephone support compared with reactive support offered to mothers of preterm infants following discharge from NICU. Six NICUs across Sweden randomised a total of 493 mothers. We used regression and survival analyses to assess the risk factors for ceasing breastfeeding and the long\u2010term outcomes of the intervention. The results showed that 305 (64%) of the infants were breastfed at 6\u00a0months and 49 (21%) at 12\u00a0months. Partial breastfeeding at discharge, low maternal educational level, and longer length of stay in the NICU increased the risk for ceasing breastfeeding during the first 12\u00a0months. Furthermore, the Kaplan\u2013Meier analysis showed that the proportion of mothers who ceased breastfeeding did not differ between the intervention ( n =\u00a0231) and controls ( n =\u00a0262) during the first 12\u00a0months (log\u2010rank test p =\u00a0.68). No difference was found between groups on method of feeding. More than 85% of the infants were fed directly at the breast. These findings provide important insights for health professionals who are supporting mothers of preterm infants to breastfeed long term. Registered in http://www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01806480).",

    "abstract": "As a result of intensive breeding, litter size has considerably increased in pig production over the last three decades. This has resulted in an increase in farrowing complications. Prolonged farrowing will shorten the window for suckling colostrum and reduce the chances for high-quality colostrum intake. Studies also agree that increasing litter sizes concomitantly resulted in decreased piglet birth weight and increased within-litter birth weight variations. Birth weight, however, is one of the critical factors affecting the prognosis of colostrum intake, and piglet growth, welfare, and survival. Litters of uneven birth weight distribution will suffer and lead to increased piglet mortality before weaning. The proper management is key to handle the situation. Feeding strategies before farrowing, management routines during parturition (e.g., drying and moving piglets to the udder and cross-fostering) and feeding an energy source to piglets after birth may be beneficial management tools with large litters. Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)-driven recovery from energy losses during lactation appears critical for supporting follicle development, the viability of oocytes and embryos, and, eventually, litter uniformity. This paper explores certain management routines for neonatal piglets that can lead to the optimization of their colostrum intake and thereby their survival in large litters. In addition, this paper reviews the evidence concerning nutritional factors, particularly lactation feeding that may reduce the loss of sow body reserves, affecting the growth of the next oocyte generation. In conclusion, decreasing birth weight and compromised immunity are subjects warranting investigation in the search for novel management tools. Furthermore, to increase litter uniformity, more focus should be placed on nutritional factors that affect IGF-1-driven follicle development before ovulation.",

The research sample comprised mothers (n = 250) with children less than 2 years old. Data were obtained via questionnaire and were analyzed using SPSS 20.0 package program. The Pearson \u03c7 2 or Fisher's exact tests were used for assessing relationships between categorical variables. The one-sample t-test was used for comparisons with reference values. Most mothers (97.2%) breastfed their babies immediately after birth. The mean time to breastfeeding after delivery was 47.8 \u00b1 14.8 minutes, and 40.8% of the mothers complied with the WHO recommendation. Furthermore, 59.8% of the mothers exclusively breastfed their children for 6 months (mean 5.2 \u00b1 1.5 months). The mean duration to the start of providing complementary food was 5.8 \u00b1 0.6 months, and 76.1% of mothers who complied with the WHO recommendation. Only 12.3% of mothers breastfed their children for at least 12 months (mean 7.7 \u00b1 3.3 months). On average, mothers gave cow milk to their children for the first time at 10.1 \u00b1 1.7 months and honey at 11.8 \u00b1 2.3 months. The mothers' rates of compliance with the WHO recommendations on cow milk and honey feeding were 32.0% and 71.6%, respectively. The rate of mothers who complied with the WHO minimum meal frequency recommendation was 88.3%. We suggest that the WHO recommendations on this subject will be realized more fully by emphasizing the importance of the positive effects of breastfeeding until the age of 2 years and of a timely start of complementary food provision. Such changes will affect child health over the long term.",

Unintentional weight loss in patients with pancreatic cancer is highly prevalent and contributes to low therapeutic tolerance, reduced quality of life, and overall mortality. Weight loss in pancreatic cancer can be due to anorexia, malabsorption, and/or cachexia. Proper supportive care can stabilize or reverse weight loss in patients and improve outcomes. We review the literature on supportive care relevant to pancreatic cancer patients, and offer evidence\u2010based recommendations that include expert nutritional assessment, counseling, supportive measures to ensure adequate caloric intake, pancreatic enzyme supplementation, nutritional supplement replacement, orexigenic agents, and exercise. Pancreatic Cancer Action Network\u2010supported initiatives will spearhead the dissemination and adoption of these best supportive care practices. Weight loss in pancreatic cancer patients is endemic, as 85% of pancreatic cancer patients meet the classic definition of cancer cachexia. Despite its significant prevalence and associated morbidity, there is no established approach to this disease entity. It is believed that this is due to an important knowledge gap in understanding the underlying biology and lack of optimal treatment approaches. This article reviews the literature regarding pancreas cancer\u2010associated weight loss and establishes a new framework from which to view this complex clinical problem. An improved approach and understanding will help educate clinicians, improve clinical care, and provide more clarity for future clinical investigation.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Infant feeding differences are strongly tied to socioeconomic status. The goal of this study is to compare determinants of early breastfeeding cessation incidence in socioeconomically marginalized (SEM) and socioeconomically privileged (SEP) populations, focusing on birthing parents who intended to breastfeed. Methods: This cohort study includes data from 451 birthing parents in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador who reported intention to breastfeed in the baseline prenatal survey. Multivariate logistic regression techniques were used to assess the determinants of breastfeeding cessation at 1 month in both SEM and SEP populations. Results: The analysis data included 73 SEM and 378 SEP birthing parents who reported intention to breastfeed at baseline. At 1 month, 24.7% (18/73) in the SEM group had ceased breastfeeding compared to 6.9% (26/378) in the SEP group. In the SEP population, score on the Iowa Infant Feeding Attitude Scale (IIFAS) (odds ratio [OR] 3.33, p =0.01) was the sole significant determinant. In the SEM population, three significant determinants were identified: unpartnered marital status (OR 5.10, p =0.05), <1\u2009h of skin-to-skin contact after birth (OR 11.92, p =0.02), and negative first impression of breastfeeding (OR 11.07, p =0.01). Conclusion: These results indicate that determinants of breastfeeding cessation differ between SEM and SEP populations intending to breastfeed. Interventions intended on improving the SEM population's postpartum breastfeeding experience using best practices, increasing support, and ensuring at least 1\u2009h of skin\u2013skin contact may increase breastfeeding rates.",

    "abstract": "Improving the health and nutrition of women and children is a priority for Western China, where the economy is less developed. Due to the dynamic nature of lifestyle, modern food habits and nutrition, there is a need to update our limited knowledge and understanding of maternal lifestyle and nutritional status and their impact on pregnancy and infant health outcomes. While breast milk is the preferred feeding option, infant formula use is widespread in China. It is thus necessary to examine the effects of formula consumption on growth and morbidity. This is an ongoing prospective cohort study started in 2015 in Chengdu, Sichuan Province. A sample of 1901 pregnant women at 15\u201320 weeks of gestation were recruited from four maternal and child health hospitals and are followed prospectively to 12 months post partum. Detailed information on maternal lifestyle and nutritional status, obstetric complications, pregnancy outcomes, infant feeding practices, illnesses of the mother and infant and growth trajectory is collected through personal interviews, anthropometric measures and medical records and local health management system records retrieval. Multilevel mixed regression models, adjusted for clustering, will be applied to investigate the association between various exposure variables of interest and the longitudinal outcomes, taking into account the correlated data structure and the nesting of observations. Kaplan-Meier test and Cox regression analysis will be used to analyse the time-to-event data. Ethical approval has been obtained from the ethics committee of West China School of Public Health, Sichuan University and the Human Research Ethics Committee of Curtin University. Results will be presented at national and international conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals.",

    "abstract": "The role of the gut microbiota in Anorexia Nervosa (AN) has long been neglected by researchers, although the fact that the former is known to play an important role in health, disease and weight regulation. Cycles of over-weight and underweight due to natural states of starvation and refeeding are normal in many vertebrates in their ecological niches. The aim of this review was to compare the similarities and differences of the gut microbiota in eating disorders with conditions of fasting and refeeding in other vertebrates. A systematic literature search was conducted in Pubmed and Web of Science to find all relevant studies examining the gut microbiota in eating disorders and different states of fasting in vertebrates for this narrative review. Gut microbiota appears to differ in AN versus normal-weight individuals. Induced fasting conditions in other ver-tebrates resulted in heterogeneous effects on gut microbiota with respect to their richness, diversity and community struc-tures. The findings for hibernating animals were generally consistent. A decrease in microbial richness and diversity was ob-served in the hibernating animal compared to the active animal, and the community structures were linked to these conditions. Some similarities and differences between AN and different states of fasting in other vertebrates were found. The complexity of the relationship between fasting and gut microbiota is difficult to interprete. A deeper bio-logical understanding is necessary to identify promising approaches for the modulation of the AN gut microbiota to support established psychotherapies",

    "abstract": "This study aimed to investigate and compare the bacterial safety of handmade and commercial ready-to-use enteral feeding formulas used in an Iranian teaching hospital. In this experimental study, a total number of 70 samples (21 handmade formulas sampled at two sampling times, i.e. the time of preparation and 18 h after preparation, and 28 commercial ready-to-use formulas) were studied. Total count of viable microorganisms, coliform count and Staphylococcus aureus count for all samples were conducted. Out of 42 handmade samples, 16 samples (76%) had total viable counts greater than 10 3 CFU/g in the first sampling time and 17 samples (81%) had total viable counts greater than 10 3 CFU/g in the second sampling time. Also, 11 (52%) had coliform contamination in the first sampling time which reached 76% (16 samples) in the second sampling time. Regarding contamination with S. aureus , 5 samples (24%) were contaminated in the first- and 13 samples (62%) were contaminated in the second-sampling time. Out of 28 commercial formulas, 27 samples (96%) had total viable counts greater than 10 3 CFU/g. Also, 24 samples (86%) were contaminated with S. aureus and 27 samples (96%) were contaminated with coliforms. In order to compare these two formulas, the results of Mann-Whitney test showed that contamination of ready-to-use formulas in all three microbiological samples was significantly more than that for handmade samples. The results of the present study indicate that the microbial safety of enteral feeding solutions in this hospital is much lower than standard values, demonstrating that the development of protocols for clean techniques in the preparation, handling and storage of both commercial and handmade enteral feeds is necessary.",

The testing device consists of a sieve (150 \u03bcm) attached to a sample chamber, sensors mounted on a supporting body and a main control unit containing a display panel. The sensors detect the difference in electrical resistance between air and water. A timer is automatically triggered by the sensor when the bottom of sample-loaded chamber contacts water in the petri dish. Wettability and dispersibility of commercial skim milk powders (SMPs) produced at different heating strengths (low-, medium-, and high-heat SMP) are compared using the new testing device. Wettability of the SMPs were correlated with particle size and are found to increase in the order of medium-, low-, and high-heat SMP regardless of the amount of sample tested. Dispersibility of SMPs showed the same trend and high heat-SMP which has the smallest particle size resulted in the lowest dispersibility. Unlike existing methods, the new testing device can determine both wettability and dispersibility of powders and successfully detected differences among the samples.",

For objective 1, 19 datasets from the literature containing initial BW, FR and specific growth rate (SGR; % BW increase per day) were used. For objective 2, 12 datasets from the literature (11 from objective 1) containing SGR, FR, final BW, body lipid (%), protein (%), ash (%), moisture (%), and energy (kJ/g) were used. The average rearing temperatures was 19.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.5 \u00b0C (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD). The average nutrient compositions and gross energy of the diets were 45.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.3% protein, 14.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.2% lipid, and 20.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.3\u00a0kJ/g, respectively. The logistic model was used for objectives 1 and 2 to develop a statistical relationship between SGR and FR, then an iterative technique was used to estimate OFR for each dataset. For objective 2, the statistical relationship between body lipid, energy, and moisture and FR was established. Using the OFR estimate, SGR, body lipid, energy and moisture were computed at various FR as a proportion of OFR. Finally, a nonparametric fitting procedure was used to establish relationships between SGR, body lipid, energy and moisture (responses) compared with BW (predictor) at various proportions of OFR. This allows visualization of the effect of under- or over-feeding on the various responses. When examining the differences between OFR at 100% and various proportions of OFR, SGR differences decrease and moisture differences increase as BW increases. Lipid and energy differences decrease as BW increases. To our knowledge, these are the first description of changes in nutrient compositions when white sturgeon are fed at various FR. Because physiological and behavioral properties that are unique to sturgeon, results from this study are specific to sturgeon under the conditions of this study and cannot be compared directly with salmonids even if some of the results are similar. This research provides insight to designing future nutritional studies in sturgeon.",

    "abstract": "International and national organizations recommend exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life, but many women stop earlier. Lay and professional persons can support mothers\u2019 efforts to overcome breastfeeding difficulties. Considering breastfeeding support to comprise emotional support, practical help, and information offered to women who desire to breastfeed (by professionals, family members, and others), we developed and tested a scale to measure it in Japan. A total of 31 items were generated by literature review and from the authors\u2019 clinical experiences. Those items were tested with 243 mothers who visited public health centers in Tokyo for their infant\u2019s health check-up 3 months after birth. Breastfeeding support and infant feeding status were then assessed 5 months after birth. All the data were collected by using self-administered questionnaires. On the basis of the results of factor analysis, the number of items was reduced to 11. There were three factors: support from breastfeeding peers and from people in specifically named healthcare professions, practical help, and support from people the mother can rely on to help meet emotional needs and address breastfeeding concerns. Internal-consistency reliability (alpha) of scores on the 11-item scale was 0.83 when measured 3 months postpartum and 0.85 when measured 5 months postpartum. Higher scores on the 11-item scale 3 months postpartum were associated with more breastfeeding exclusivity both at that time (Kruskal\u2013Wallis test, chi-squared = 14.871, df = 3, n = 211, p = 0.002, eta-squared = 0.071) and also 5 months postpartum (Kruskal\u2013Wallis test, chi-squared = 8.556, df = 3, n = 159, p = 0.036, eta-squared = 0.054). Further, the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve was 0.73 (95% CI [0.57\u20130.88]), which indicates that scores on the 11-item scale 3 months postpartum may be useful to predict which mothers will be less exclusive in breastfeeding 5 months postpartum. In conclusion, scores on this 11-item scale were reasonably reliable and valid for measuring breastfeeding support provided by lay and professional persons to mothers in Japan. Further research is required to evaluate this scale\u2019s applicability in other settings.",

    "abstract": "Background and Objective: Nausea, vomiting, and anorexia are the most common side effects reported in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The present study aimed to determine the effect of peppermint extract on the severity of nausea, vomiting, and anorexia in patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Methods and Materials: In this randomized controlled trial, we selected 84 patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. They were then assigned to 2 groups of experimental and control (n\u2009=\u200942, each) using block randomization. Patients in the experimental group received 40 drops of peppermint extract mixed in 20\u2009cc of tap water every 8\u2009hours, while patients in the control group received 40 drops of distilled water mixed in 20\u2009cc of tap water every 8\u2009hours. The severity of nausea, vomiting, and anorexia was measured and recorded before the intervention, and immediately, 24 and 48\u2009hours after the chemotherapy using the Visual Analogue Scale. Statistical analysis of the data was conducted using SPSS software version 21. Results: The results of the present study revealed that there was a significant difference between the 2 groups at 24 and 48\u2009hours after the chemotherapy ( P <\u2009.05), so that the mean score of the severity of nausea, vomiting, and anorexia in the experimental group was lower than in the control group ( P <\u2009.05). Conclusion: The use of peppermint as a method in complementary medicine may improve nausea, vomiting, and anorexia in patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Further studies with greater sample size and longer follow-up period are needed to confirm the current findings.",

Explainability is particularly important when dealing with a sensitive domain application such as clinical psychology. This paper focuses on the quantitative assessment of user-level attention mechanism in the task of detecting signs of anorexia in social media users from their posts. The assessment is done through monitoring the performance measures of a neural classifier, with and without user-level attention, when only a limited number of highly-weighted posts are provided. Results show that the weights assigned by the user-level attention strongly correlate with the amount of information that posts provide in showing if their author is at risk of anorexia or not, and hence can be used to explain the decision of the neural classifier.",

    "abstract": "One identified solution to prevent obesity in cats is to control and limit their calorie intake. The objective of the present work was to better elucidate the impact of calorie cut-off on the feeding behaviour of cats. A control (n\u2009=\u200931) and a test group of cats (n\u2009=\u200938) were included in the present study. Both groups received the same food variety during the study. A period of ad libitum feeding was initially set (T0), followed by a 9-month mild calorie restriction period for the test group only (T9; average calorie restriction\u2009=\u20096%), and a final period of ad libitum feeding (T10). The individual cat feeding behaviours were measured via an electronic feeding system, and agonistic interactions between cats during food anticipation via video observations. Generalised linear mixed models were fitted to compare all feeding parameters between periods by group. No statistical analyses could be performed on the agonistic interactions data owing to their structure. The feeding behaviour of the control group remained stable during the entire study, while the test group showed fewer but larger meals taken at shorter time intervals and a faster eating rate in response to calorie restriction. The average total number of agonistic interactions per cat increased during the calorie cut-off period in the test group only. One month after returning to ad libitum feeding, all behaviours were largely restored to baseline values. Behavioural changes expressed by cats under calorie restriction can explain some of the difficulties obtaining cat owners\u2019 compliance with dietary restriction, especially in multi-cat households. Feeding strategies should be utilised to help cats be less impulsive and maintain normal feeding patterns when moving away from ad libitum feeding.",

    "abstract": "Cachexia affects up to two thirds of all cancer patients and is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. It is a complex metabolic syndrome associated with the underlying illness and characterized by loss of skeletal muscle tissue with or without loss of fat mass. Cachexia\u2019s other prominent clinical symptoms include anorexia, systemic inflammation, pediatric growth failure, and hypogonadism. The relationship between the symptoms of cancer cachexia and the underlying illness is unclear, and there is an urgent need for a better understanding of the pathophysiology of this syndrome. Normal Zn metabolism is often disrupted in cancer patients, but the possible effects of systemic Zn dyshomeostasis in cachexia have not been investigated. We propose that the acute phase response can mediate Zn redistribution and accumulation in skeletal muscle tissue and contribute to the activation of the ubiquitin\u2013proteasome pathway that regulates protein catabolism. This chronic redistribution deprives Zn from other tissues and organs and compromises critical physiological functions in the body. The cardinal symptoms of Zn deficiency are anorexia, systemic inflammation, growth failure in children, and hypogonadism. These symptoms also prominently characterize cancer cachexia suggesting that the role of systemic Zn dyshomeostasis in cachexia should be investigated.",

Intrusive images of ED patients were significantly more repetitive, detailed, vivid, and distressing than intrusive images of dieting and/or nondieting controls. Most of the intrusive images were the same for the ED subtypes; however, patients with anorexia nervosa were more likely to report an observer vantage perspective than patients with bulimia nervosa, who were more likely to report a field vantage perspective. As expected, intrusive images' content was related to body checking (weight and shape) or negative self (evaluated by themselves or others). Finally, there were significant associations between intrusive images' vividness and weight and shape concerns. These findings indicate that intrusive images may be a core element of EDs and targeting intrusive images in therapy may be helpful.",

Recent studies have shown that the mother's life-style has an important role in the methods used by mother to feed child, child's diet and body mass index (BMI). This study paper aimed to investigate the association between mother's weight efficacy life-style (WEL) with feeding practices and diet in children aged 3-6 years. In this cross-sectional study, which was carried out in 18 Primary Schools of Rasht (Iran) in 2012, 165 mothers with children aged 3-6 years were participated. Mothers reported their own and their child's demographics. Aspects of mother's WEL and mother's control practices were assessed using WEL questionnaire and Comprehensive Feeding Practices Questionnaire respectively. Height and weight of mothers participated in the study were measured. Child's dietary intake was measured using Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). The role of mother's weight efficacy in predicting child's feeding practices and child's diet was assessed using the linear regression. Statistical significance for all P values was set at 0.003. The results were showed that mother's weight efficacy was related to child feeding practices and child's dietary intake. The mothers with similar WEL applied similar methods in child nutrition. Mothers with better weight efficacy used more encourage balance and variety (\u03b2 = 1.860), environmental control (\u03b2 = 0.437), child involvement (\u03b2 = 0.203) and less emotion regulation using foods (\u03b2 = \u22120.213) and their children eat fewer snacks (\u03b2 = \u22120.318) (P V = 0.003). The result of this study showed that maternal life-style was associated with feeding practices and child's intake. There was no significant relation between the maternal self-efficacy and child BMI.",

    "abstract": "Ilioinguinal and iliohypogastric (II/IH) nerve injury is one of the most common nerve injuries following pelvic surgery, especially with the Pfannenstiel incision. We present a case of intractable groin pain, successfully treated with a continuous II/IH nerve block. A 33-year-old woman, following emergency cesarean section due to cephalopelvic disproportion, presented numbness in left inguinal area and severe pain on the labia on the second postoperative day. The pain was burning, lancinating, and exacerbated by standing or movement. However, she didn't want to take additional medicine because of breast-feeding. A diagnostic II/IH nerve block produced a substantial decrease in pain. She underwent a continuous II/IH nerve block with a complete resolution of pain within 3 days. A continuous II/IH nerve block might be a goodoption for II/IH neuropathy with intractable groin pain in breast-feeding mothers without adverse drug reactions in their infants.",

    "abstract": "Diarrhea is a common childhood illness and one of the leading causes of death in young children globally. In Ethiopia, a significant number of deaths and hospitalizations in under-five children are related to diarrheal diseases. Inappropriate feeding during diarrhea leads to a double burden of diarrhea recurrence and malnutrition among children. However, empirical evidence is limited in Ethiopia. Thus, this study was aimed to assess feeding practices and associated factors during diarrheal disease among children aged less than five years in Ethiopia. The study used the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) 2016 data. A two-stage stratified sampling technique was applied to identify 917 under five years children. Generalized linear mixed model analyses were computed, and a P value of less than 0.05 and an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to identify statistically significant factors with feeding practices. The majority (92.5%) of mothers were married. Out of the participants, (54.1%) of children were male; 55.6% of them were in the age group of 6\u201323 months. The appropriate feeding practices for children aged less than five years who had diarrhea was 15.4% (95% CI: 13.7%-18.2%). Mothers aged 25\u201334 years (AOR: 0.6, 95% CI: 0.4\u20130.9), agricultural occupation of mothers (AOR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.3\u20133.6), mothers attended four and more antenatal visit (AOR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.3\u20134.32) and mothers who had a postnatal checkup within two months of birth (AOR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.1\u20133.2) were factors statistically associated with child feeding practices during diarrhea. Less than one-fifth of under-five children practiced appropriate feeding during diarrheal disease. Working in agriculture and attending antenatal care and postnatal checkup within two months were positively influencing feeding practice. Therefore, the government of Ethiopia needs to strengthen the existing maternal and child health services.",

    "abstract": "In addition to various barriers studied for kangaroo mother care (KMC), time opportunities for better implementation of KMC need to be studied. Time\u2013motion analysis of the mother's daily activities was carried out to identify scope to improve KMC. This is a 24-h recall-based questionnaire study. Mothers were interviewed whose newborns were admitted at a tertiary and secondary care neonatal care unit of western India over a period of 9 months from November 2015 to July 2016. Mothers were approached when the preterm neonate and mother dyad was eligible for KMC, that is, when mothers were physically healthy and newborns were physiologically stable. A total of 60 mothers were enrolled in the study. Mothers\u2019 daily activities were noted, and time spent in each activity was charted for 3 consecutive days. Missed time opportunities which could be used to increase daily KMC hours were studied. To compare quantitative variables, two-sample unpaired t -test and one-way analysis of variance were used. The average time of activities which consumed most was 8.24 h for sleep/rest, 3.46 h for meals/snacks, 4.89 h for breastfeeding, and a daily average of only 1.4 h was used for KMC. A quite a significant proportion, that is, 3.89 h, was spent for meeting relatives which could be used for KMC as well without affecting social meetings. Time\u2013motion analysis was helpful to find out weak links in KMC implementation. Providing family-centered environment in terms of implementing KMC during meeting hours with family may augment KMC hours.",

    "abstract": "Food consumption is an important behavior that is regulated by an intricate array of neuropeptides (NPs). Although many feeding-related NPs have been identified in mammals, precise mechanisms are unclear and difficult to study in mammals, as current methods are not highly multiplexed and require extensive a priori knowledge about analytes. New advances in data-independent acquisition (DIA) MS/MS and the open-source quantification software Skyline have opened up the possibility to identify hundreds of compounds and quantify them from a single DIA MS/MS run. An untargeted DIA MS E quantification method using Skyline software for multiplexed, discovery-driven quantification was developed and found to produce linear calibration curves for peptides at physiologically relevant concentrations using a protein digest as internal standard. By using this method, preliminary relative quantification of the crab Cancer borealis neuropeptidome (<2 kDa, 137 peptides from 18 families) was possible in microdialysates from 8 replicate feeding experiments. Of these NPs, 55 were detected with an average mass error below 10 ppm. The time-resolved profiles of relative concentration changes for 6 are shown, and there is great potential for the use of this method in future experiments to aid in correlation of NP changes with behavior. This work presents an unbiased approach to winnowing candidate NPs related to a behavior of interest in a functionally relevant manner, and demonstrates the success of such a UPLC-MS E quantification method using the open source software Skyline.",

    "abstract": "Female\u2010initiated HIV prevention methods, such as oral pre\u2010exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and the vaginal ring, may be important risk reduction strategies for breastfeeding women. Given their novelty, information about the sociocultural context and how it influences perceptions of and support for their use during breastfeeding is lacking. To address this gap, we conducted 23 focus group discussions separately with pregnant and breastfeeding women, male partners and grandmothers ( N = 196) and 36 in\u2010depth interviews with key informants in Malawi, South Africa, Uganda and Zimbabwe. We analysed the data using a framework analysis method. Overall, breastfeeding was the norm, and participants described the transference of health (e.g., nutrition) and disease (e.g., HIV) to children through breast milk. Participants considered the early breastfeeding period as one of high HIV transmission risk for women. They explained that male partners tend to seek outside sexual partners during this period because women need time to recover from delivery, women focus their attention on the child, and some men are disgusted by breast milk. Participants highlighted concerns about the drugs in oral PrEP transferring to the child through breast milk, but fewer worried about the effects of the vaginal ring because the drug is localized. Women, grandmothers and key informants were supportive of women using these HIV prevention methods during breastfeeding, while male partners had mixed opinions. These findings can be used to tailor messages for promoting the use of PrEP or the vaginal ring during breastfeeding in sub\u2010Saharan Africa.",

We present a case of RFS subsequent to biliopancreatic diversion in a morbidly obese patient. A 48-year-old female patient with a BMI of 41.5 kg/m 2 was transferred to our hospital due to Wernicke\u2018s Encephalopathy in a global malabsorptive syndrome after biliopancreatic diversion. Parenteral nutrition, vitamin supplementation and high-dosed intravenous thiamine supplementation were initiated. After 14 days, the patient started to develop acute respiratory failure, and neurological functions were impaired. Blood values showed significant electrolyte disturbances. RFS was diagnosed and managed according to the NICE guidelines. After 14 days, phosphate levels had returned to normal range, and neurological symptoms were improved. Extreme weight loss following obesity surgery has been shown to be associated with undernutrition. These patients are at high risk for evolving RFS, even though they may still be obese. Awareness of RFS as a postsurgical complication, the identification of patients at risk as well as prevention and correct management should be routinely performed at every bariatric center.",

Here, we report a case of an anorexic 55-year-old male with a history of pharyngo-laryngo-esophagogastrectomy, initially hospitalized with status epilepticus. Although his consciousness gradually recovered as we were controlling his convulsion, it deteriorated again with new onset of anisocoria, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at this point revealed CPM. Rapid change of serum sodium or osmolarity, which is often associated with CPM, had not been apparent throughout his hospitalization. Instead, a review of the serum biochemistry test results showed that serum phosphate had drastically declined the day before the MRI first detected CPM. In this case, we suspect that hypophosphatemia induced by refeeding syndrome greatly contributed to the occurrence of CPM.",

    "abstract": "The worldwide prevalence of overweight and obesity is at alarming levels. Nearly one in three children in Europe is overweight or obese. Disordered eating and body image concerns are equally widespread and increase risk for more chronic and severe weight-related problems. Research has shown that online interventions that address both healthy weight regulation and body image can reduce risk for eating disorders and obesity simultaneously and are feasible to implement in school settings. To date, evaluation and dissemination of such programs in Europe is scant. The Healthy Teens @ School study is a multi-country cluster-randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the effectiveness of an unguided, online, multi-level intervention for promoting a healthy lifestyle and reducing problematic eating behavior, eating disorder and obesity risk among students aged 14 to 19\u202fyears with control condition. As part of the Horizon 2020 funded project ICare (GA No. 634757) the trial is conducted in Austria and Spain. Cluster randomization by school is used. The intervention is an adapted version of an evidence-based program developed in the USA (StayingFit). Participants of the intervention group are assigned to one of two possible program tracks based on the results of the initial online-assessment: Overweight adolescents are assigned to the \u201cWeight Management\u201d track emphasizing balanced eating and exercise for weight maintenance, and all other individuals are assigned to the \u201cHealthy Habits\u201d track which aims at promoting healthy habits related to e.g., nutrition, physical activity, sleep. The participants of both tracks work on ten modules (one 20\u201330\u202fmin module per week) during school hours and/or at home. Assessments are conducted at pre- and post-intervention, and at 6- and 12-months after baseline assessment. The primary outcome is intuitive eating, secondary outcomes are eating disorder symptomatology, body image concerns, body mass index, food intake, physical activity, self-esteem, stress coping, depression, and anxiety. Following the initial assessment, individuals in the control group do not have access to the prevention program but continue as normal and are only prompted to the assessments at all time points. At the end of the 12-month study they will get access to the program. The results from this study will add to the understanding of how to address eating and weight related problems in adolescents and will shed light on the feasibility of implementing online prevention programs in school routine in Austria and Spain.

DalMorNefteGeofizika (DMNG) on behalf of the Sakhalin-1 consortium conducted a 3-D seismic survey of the Odoptu license area during 17 August\u2019 September 2001. A portion of the primary feeding area of the endangered western gray whale ( Eschrichtius robustus ) is located in the vicinity of the seismic survey. This paper presents data to assess whether western gray whale bottom feeding activity, as indicated by visible mud plumes, was affected by seismic operations. The mitigation and monitoring program associated with the seismic survey included aerial surveys during 19 July\u20199 November 2001. These aerial surveys documented the local and regional distribution, abundance, and bottom feeding activity of western gray whales. Data on gray whale feeding activity before, during and after the seismic survey were collected, with the whales assumed to be feeding on the benthos if mud plumes were observed on the surface. The data were used to assess the influence of seismic survey and other factors (including environmental) on feeding activity of western gray whales. A stepwise multiple regression analysis failed to find a statistically significant effect ( \u03b1 \u2019\u2019.05) of the seismic survey on frequency of occurrence of mud plumes of western gray whales used as a proxy to evaluate bottom feeding activity in Piltun feeding area. The regression indicated that transect number (a proxy for water depth, related to distance from shore) and swell height (a proxy for sea state) were the only variables that had a significant effect on frequency of whale mud plumes. It is concluded that the 2001 seismic survey had no measurable effect ( \u03b1 \u2019\u2019.05) on bottom feeding activity of western gray whales off Sakhalin Island.",

    "abstract": "Existing initiatives to promote healthy eating remain largely ineffective as individuals struggle to adhere to dietary recommendations. Therefore, challenging the strategies currently used is of significant importance. Recent studies have indicated the potential of an approach oriented towards eating pleasure to promote the consumption of healthy foods. The aim of this study was to compare perceptions and the potential effect of pleasure-oriented and health-oriented messages promoting healthy eating among French-Canadians. Two leaflets similar in all respects, except for the message orientation (pleasure or health), were developed. Perceived message orientation and effectiveness, perceptions towards healthy eating as well as emotions, attitude towards healthy eating, and intention to eat healthily were evaluated. A total of 100 adults (50% women; mean \u00b1 SD age 45.1\u00a0\u00b1\u00a013.0 y) were randomly assigned to read 1 of the 2 leaflets (pleasure: n = 50; health: n = 50). Questionnaires were completed online and data were also collected at a visit made to the Institute of Nutrition and Functional Foods. The difference in message orientation (pleasure compared with health) was well perceived by participants ( P \u2264\u00a00.01). The pleasure-oriented message was successful in inducing the perception that eating healthy can be pleasurable (pre- compared with post-reading; P =\u00a00.01). Perceived message effectiveness and induced emotions in response to reading were similar between leaflets. Both messages significantly improved global attitude towards healthy eating ( P \u2264\u00a00.01) and increased intention to eat healthily ( P <\u00a00.001). Additional analyses showed that the affective attitude towards healthy eating increased more after reading the pleasure leaflet than the health leaflet ( P =\u00a00.05), whereas the health message tended to improve cognitive attitude more than the pleasure leaflet ( P =\u00a00.06). These findings suggest that the leaflets would be appropriate to promote healthy eating through 2 distinct approaches (health and pleasure paradigms) and propose that different effects on attitude could be observed from these 2 approaches.",

An additional questionnaire completed by their parents provided information about the children's ADHD and emotional symptoms, sedentary behaviour based on screen time, and parental variables. The questionnaires were surveyed within one week after their schools' annual physical check-up. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that uncontrolled eating was complete mediator in association between ADHD symptoms and body mass index (BMI) for boys, incomplete mediator for girls. However, screen time had no significant effect on the ADHD symptoms-BMI link for both gender. The findings of this study suggest that gender specific intervention programs may be need to help eating behaviour in children with ADHD and overweight.",

    "abstract": "On March 15, 2020, the Dutch Government implemented COVID-19 lockdown measures. Although self-quarantine and social-distancing measures were implemented, restrictions were less severe compared to several other countries. The aim of this study was to assess changes in eating behavior and food purchases among a representative adult sample in the Netherlands (n\u00a0=\u00a01030), five weeks into lockdown. The results show that most participants did not change their eating behaviors (83.0%) or food purchases (73.3%). However, socio-demographic differences were observed among those that reported changes during lockdown. For example, participants with overweight (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.26, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.24\u20134.11) and obesity (OR\u00a0=\u00a04.21, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a02.13\u20138.32) were more likely to indicate to eat unhealthier during lockdown compared to participants with a healthy weight. Those with a high educational level (OR\u00a0=\u00a02.25, 95%-CI\u00a0=\u00a01.03\u20134.93) were also more likely to indicate to eat unhealthier during lockdown compared to those with a low educational level. Older participants were more likely to indicate to experience no differences in their eating behaviors compared to those of younger age, who were more likely to indicate that they ate healthier (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.03, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.01\u20131.04) as well as unhealthier (OR\u00a0=\u00a01.04, 95%CI\u00a0=\u00a01.02\u20131.06) during lockdown.

Of those that used meal delivery services before, 174 (29.5%) indicated to use meal delivery services more frequently during lockdown. Although the results confirm the persistence of dietary routines, profound socio-demographic differences were observed for those that did report changes. Especially for individuals with overweight and obesity, the lockdown has taken its toll on healthy dietary choices. Further research should unravel underlying mechanisms for these observations.",

The aim of this study was to explore the best evidence of continuous nasal feeding in stroke patients and translate the evidence into clinical practice. This study utilized the standard procedures of the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) evidence-based nursing centers\u2019 clinical evidence-practice application system. The baseline assessment of stroke patients in the neurology ward was conducted.

The working time of nurses undergoing nasal feeding decreased from 23.71 \u00b13.22 min to 7.73 \u00b11.14 min (P =0.000) and the length of patient\u2019s hospitalization decreased from 35.63 \u00b14.45 days to 35.00 \u00b13.70 days (P=0.534). The rate of aspiration, aspiration pneumonia did not show a significant difference after implementation of the evidence-based strategies. The results revealed that the evidence-based practice of continuous nasal feeding in stroke patients is an effective method to improve nursing quality and reduce gastrointestinal complications, which was worthy of clinical application.",

    "abstract": "The aim of this study was to prove our hypothesis that adult rats with lowering of body weight gain, rats at 12 weeks of age as an example, are suitable for evaluation of myelotoxicity. Age-related differences between young rats (6-week-old study) and adult rats (12-week-old study) were analyzed in hematological examination values. The data of the young rats were reprinted from our previous report (Miyata et al., 2009) since our hypothesis was verified by comparison with that previous report. Several experimental groups were defined for the 12-week-old study as well as for the 6-week-old study; these included 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treated groups receiving 12, 15 and 18 mg/kg/day (FU12, FU15 and FU18), pair-feeding groups (R12, R15 and R18 receiving the same amount of food as in the FU12, FU15 and FU18 groups, respectively) and a nontreated control group. Numerous hematologic and bone marrow parameters in the 5-FU treated groups were comparable to those in the corresponding pair-feeding groups in both age studies. Generally, the influences of undernutrition were more apparent in the young rats than in the adult rats. Histopathological examinations showed a decrease in hematopoiesis in the bone marrow in the 5-FU treated and pair-feeding groups. No apparent differences were observed in the decreased hematopoiesis between the 5-FU treated and pair-feeding groups in the 6-week-old study, but a difference between these groups was noted in the 12-week-old study; decreased hematopoiesis was more frequently noted in the 5-FU treated groups. These facts suggest that adult rats are more suitable than young rats for evaluation of 5-FU-induced myelotoxicity.",

We enrolled 40 patients with cancer-related anorexia. The enrolled participants were randomly allocated to 2 groups: the control group (n\u2009=\u200920), which received nutrition counseling, and the treatment group (n\u2009=\u200920), which received nutrition counseling and was administered YGJT at twice a day for 4\u2009weeks (a total of 56 times @ 3.0\u2009g each time). The primary outcome of this study was the score on the anorexia/cachexia subscale (ACS) of the Functional Assessment of Anorexia/Cachexia Therapy (FAACT). The secondary outcomes were the FAACT score with the ACS score excluded, the score on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for appetite, and the results on laboratory tests regarding appetite, such as leptin, tumor necrosis factors (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and ghrelin. All variables related to the safety assessment, such as vital signs, electrocardiography results, laboratory test results (complete blood cell count, chemistry, urine test), and adverse events, were documented on the case report form (CRF) at every visit. The difference in the primary outcome, that is, the score on the anorexia/cachexia subscale (ACS) of the Functional Assessment of Anorexia/Cachexia Therapy (FAACT), between the control and the treatment groups was statistically significant ( P =\u2009.023) as was the difference in the FAACT scores with the ACS score excluded, a secondary outcome, between the 2 groups; however, no statistically significant differences were noted in the scores on the VAS or the levels of leptin, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and ghrelin. In addition, no significant differences in the numbers and the types of adverse events or in the results on the laboratory tests between the control and the treatment groups were recorded. These results obtained in this research confirmed the efficacy and the safety of using YGJT as a herb-medicine treatment option for patients with cancer-related anorexia.",

    "abstract": "Background : Insufficient breastfeeding promotion and support by physicians contribute to suboptimal breastfeeding rates globally. Understanding setting-specific barriers against breastfeeding promotion and support from the perspective of medical students and addressing those that can be modified through undergraduate medical education may help improve learning outcomes, medical practice, and ultimately health outcomes associated with breastfeeding. Objectives : We selected the underserved and under-supported public medical school in Lebanon to explore psychosocial, institutional, and societal barriers hindering effective preventative medicine practices using breastfeeding promotion and support as an exemplar case. Methods : One-on-one semi-structured interviews, each lasting around 60 min, were conducted with medical interns (in Med III and Med IV) at their training hospitals. Interviews were voice-recorded, transcribed verbatim, coded, and analyzed thematically based on Theory of Planned Behavior. Results : Interns ( n = 49; 96% response rate) completed the study. Five major themes emerged addressing barriers at various levels. At the health care system level at large, interns identified the predominant focus on pathophysiology and treatment rather than on disease prevention and health promotion as a barrier. At the level of trainees and their education experiences, interns reported limited and optional clerkship training in obstetrics/gynecology and in neonatology which contributes to their insufficient knowledge and low self-efficacy. Competing financial interests from infant formula companies and social pressures to promote infant formula were identified as two main barriers at the level of physicians and clinical practice. Conclusions : Our work using breastfeeding as an exemplary case highlights how undergraduate medical education and its learning outcomes and how medical practices and patient behavior are highly intertwined with psychosocial, institutional, and social drivers and constraints. Re-evaluating the success of undergraduate medical curricula in light of overcoming these constraints and not only based on meeting national accreditation and certification guidelines might prove helpful in improving medical education and ultimately clinical practice.",

    "abstract": "Data are limited on how feeding knowledge and practices relate to child undernutrition in the highlands of Madagascar. This study assessed maternal knowledge and practices of complementary feeding and their associations with anthropometrics of children aged 6\u201323 mo in the Vakinankaratra region of Madagascar. Knowledge was assessed using WHO recommendations on child feeding, and WHO infant and young child feeding (IYCF) indicators were used to evaluate feeding practices. Child growth was measured as length-for-age, weight-for-age, and weight-for-length z -scores using the 2006 WHO growth standards. A z -score less than \u22122 was classified as child undernutrition. Logistic regression models were used to determine associations between independent variables and outcomes. Focus group discussions among mothers and in-depth interviews with key informants were conducted; barriers and facilitators of optimal feeding practices were identified using a thematic analysis approach. Maternal knowledge scores regarding child feeding averaged 6.4 of 11. Better knowledge scores were associated with higher odds of appropriate complementary feeding practices before and after covariate adjustments. The proportions of children achieving the minimum dietary diversity (35.8%), minimum acceptable diet (30.2%), and consuming meat, fish, and poultry (14.1%) were low. Only consumption of iron-rich foods was associated with lower odds of underweight (adjusted OR = 0.3; 95% CI: 0.1, 0.7; P <\u00a00.05). None of the IYCF indicators were associated significantly with stunting or wasting. Maternal attitudes about complementary foods, as well as mothers\u2019 workload and very low income, were identified as barriers to optimal feeding practices. Maternal perceived benefits of giving appropriate complementary foods as well as their positive relationship with the community health workers were the main facilitators of optimal child feeding. Integrated nutrition-sensitive interventions addressing these barriers while enhancing the facilitators are critical in promoting better feeding practices in the Vakinankaratra region. This study assessed linkages between maternal knowledge, complementary feeding practices, and child undernutrition in a highly agriculturally productive region in Madagascar.",

    "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a life-threatening mental disorder that is associated with substantial caregiver burden. Carers of individuals with AN report high levels of distress and self-blame, and insufficient knowledge to help their loved ones. However, carers can have a very important role to play in aiding recovery from AN, and are often highly motivated to assist in the treatment process. This manuscript presents the protocol for a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of We Can, a web-based intervention for carers for people with AN. The study aims to investigate the effectiveness of We Can delivered with different intensities of support. The study takes the form of a multi-site, two-country, three group RCT, comparing We Can (a) with clinician messaging support (We Can-Ind), (b) with moderated carer chatroom support (We Can-Chat) and (c) with online forum only (We Can-Forum). Participants will be 303 carers of individuals with AN as well as, where possible, the individuals with AN themselves. Recruitment will be via specialist eating disorder services and carer support services in the UK and Germany. Randomisation of carers to one of the three intervention conditions in a 1:1:1 ratio will be stratified by whether or not the individual with AN has (a) agreed to participate in the study and (b) is a current inpatient. The We Can intervention will be provided to carers online over a period of 12\u202fweeks. Participants will complete self-report questionnaires at pre-intervention (T1), mid-intervention (mediators only; 4-weeks post-randomisation), post-intervention (T2; 3-months post randomisation), and 6\u202fmonths (T3) and 12\u202fmonths (T4) after randomisation. The primary outcome variables are carer symptoms of depression and anxiety. Secondary outcome variables will be measured in both carers and individuals with AN. Secondary carer outcome variables will include alcohol and drug use and quality of life, caregiving behaviour, and the acceptability and use of We Can and associated supports. Secondary outcomes measured in individuals with AN will include eating disorder symptoms, and symptoms of depression and anxiety. The study will also evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the three We Can conditions, and test for mediators and moderators of the effects of We Can. The trial is registered at the International Standard Randomisation Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) database, registration number: ISRCTN11399850.

The median birth weight of the 45 subjects (26 males) was 2770\u00a0g (range 2006\u20103695\u00a0g). Of these, 10 developed SUPC during early skin\u2010to\u2010skin contact ( SSC ). Medical personnel were not present in all 10 cases: nine were being breastfed at the time and eight of the mothers did not notice their infant's abnormal condition until medical staff alerted them. This national study of children with cerebral palsy who appeared healthy at birth found that unsupervised breastfeeding was a common factor in cases of SUPC during early SSC .  ",

    "abstract": "Although a significant proportion of plant tissue is located in roots and other below-ground parts of plants, little is known on the dietary choices of root-feeding insects. This is caused by a lack of adequate methodology which would allow tracking below-ground trophic interactions between insects and plants. Here, we present a DNA-based approach to examine this relationship. Feeding experiments were established where either wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) or maize ( Zea mays ) was fed to Agriotes larvae (Coleoptera: Elateridae), allowing them to digest for up to 72\u00a0h. Due to the very small amount of plant tissue ingested (max\u00a0=\u00a06.76\u00a0mg), DNA extraction procedures and the sensitivity of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) had to be optimized. Whole-body DNA extracts of larvae were tested for the presence of both rbc L and trn L plastid DNA using universal primers. Moreover, based on cpDNA sequences encoding chloroplast tRNA for leucine ( trn L), specific primers for maize and wheat were developed. With both, general and specific primers, plant DNA was detectable in the guts of Agriotes larvae for up to 72\u00a0h post-feeding, the maximum time of digestion in these experiments. No significant effect of time since feeding on plant DNA detection success was observed, except for the specific primers in maize-fed larvae. Here, plant DNA detection was negatively correlated with the duration of digestion. Both, meal size and initial mass of the individual larvae did not affect the rate of larvae testing positive for plant DNA. The outcomes of this study represent a first step towards a specific analysis of the dietary choices of soil-living herbivores to further increase our understanding of animal\u2013plant feeding interactions in the soil. \u25ba We identified ingested plant material by molecular means from Agriotes larvae, which are amongst the most important soil pests in arable land. \u25ba Whole-body DNA extracts of larvae were tested for the presence of both rbc L and trn L plastid DNA using universal primers and specific primers. \u25ba Plant DNA was detectable in the guts of Agriotes larvae for up to 72 h post-feeding. \u25ba Time since feeding, meal size and initial mass of the individual larvae did not affect the rate of larvae testing positive for plant DNA. \u25ba This work will facilitate future studies on soil food web ecology.",

A total of 199 patients underwent colorectal surgery and were randomly assigned to early feeding (n\u200a=\u200a99) or a regular diet (n\u200a=\u200a100). Patients' characteristics, diagnoses, surgical procedures, comorbidity, bowel movements, defecation, nasogastric tube reinsertion, time of tolerance of solid diet, complications, and length of hospitalization were assessed. The two groups were similar in terms of gender, age, diagnosis, surgical procedures, and comorbidity. In the early feeding group, 85.9% of patients tolerated the early feeding schedule. Bowel movements (1.7\u00b10.89 vs. 3.27\u00b11.3), defecation (3.4\u00b10.77 vs. 4.38\u00b11.18) and time of tolerance of solid diet (2.48\u00b10.85 vs. 4.77\u00b11.81) were significantly earlier in the early feeding group. There was no change between the groups in terms of nasogastric tube reinsertion, overall complication or anastomotic leakage. Hospitalization (5.55\u00b12.35 vs. 9.0\u00b16.5) was shorter in the early feeding group. The present study indicated that early oral feeding after elective colorectal surgery was not only well tolerated by patients but also affected the postoperative outcomes positively. Early postoperative feeding is safe and leads to the early recovery of gastrointestinal functions.",

We conducted a population-based study of all 1,439,363 persons born in Denmark during 1971\u20131997 to investigate relationships between childhood cross-municipality residential moves from year of birth to age 14 years and the development of a range of psychiatric disorders from mid-adolescence to early middle age. We examined: (1) Any substance misuse disorders; specifically alcohol misuse, and cannabis misuse; (2) Any personality disorders; specifically antisocial, and borderline personality disorders; (3) Schizophrenia and related disorders; specifically schizophrenia, and schizoaffective disorder; (4) Any mood disorders; specifically bipolar disorder, and depressive disorder; (5) Any anxiety and somatoform disorders; specifically obsessive compulsive disorder; (6) Any eating disorders; specifically anorexia nervosa. Childhood residential mobility was associated with elevated risks of developing most psychiatric disorders, even after controlling for potential confounders. The associations generally rose with increasing age at moving and were stronger for multiple moves in a year compared to a single move. Links were particularly strong for antisocial personality disorder, any substance misuse disorder, and cannabis misuse in particular, for which the highest increases in risks were observed if relocation occurred during adolescence. Childhood residential change was not linked to subsequent risk of developing an eating disorder. Frequent residential mobility could be a marker for familial adversities. Mental health services and schools need to be vigilant of the psychosocial needs of children, particularly adolescents, who have recently moved homes. \u2022 Childhood residential relocation predicted elevated risk of psychiatric disorder. \u2022 Strengths of association varied greatly between diagnostic groups. \u2022 Greatest risk elevations for cannabis misuse and antisocial personality disorders. \u2022 No increased risk for eating disorders. \u2022 Children who moved multiple times or during adolescence especially vulnerable.

Although several reports are available on cases developing both sarcoidosis and cancer metachronously, cases of simultaneous diagnosis of these diseases have rarely been reported. A 67-year-old woman diagnosed with endometrial cancer had developed systemic lymph node swelling, including bilateral hilar, paraaortic, and a few pelvic lymph nodes, as observed on preoperative imaging. During surgery, frozen sections of a paraaortic lymph node were examined, revealing noncaseating granulomas compatible with sarcoidosis. Next, modified radical hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and pelvic lymphadenectomy were performed. Postoperative pathological analysis revealed endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the uterus, and no metastasis but noncaseating granulomas were detected in the resected lymph nodes. Postoperatively, we identified cutaneous sarcoidosis and uveitis in the presence of a tuberculin-negative test. On the basis of these findings, we diagnosed the patients with endometrial cancer complicated by sarcoidosis. She underwent adjuvant chemotherapy, and at the 1-year follow-up, the lymph node swelling due to sarcoidosis was stable, and no recurrence of the cancer was observed. This turned out to be a case of early endometrial cancer mimicking advanced cancer by sarcoidosis. Histological confirmation and additional examination for sarcoidosis are necessary in cancer patients suspected of sarcoidosis.",

    "abstract": "Enteral nutrition (EN) is very important to optimizing outcomes in critical illness. Debate exists regarding the best strategy for enteral tube feeding (TF), with concerns that bolus TF (BTF) may increase glycemic variability (GV) but result in fewer nutritional interruptions than continuous TF (CTF). This study examines if there is a difference in GV, insulin usage, TF volume, and caloric delivery among intensive care patients receiving BTF versus CTF. We hypothesize that there are no significant differences between CTF and BTF when comparing the above parameters. Prospective, randomized pilot study of critically ill adult patients undergoing percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) placement for EN was performed between March 1, 2012 and May 15, 2014. Patients were randomized to BTF or CTF. Glucose values, insulin use, TF volume, and calories administered were recorded. Data were organized into 12-h epochs for statistical analyses and GV determination. In addition, time to \u226580% nutritional delivery goal, demographics, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores, and TF interruptions were examined. When performing BTF versus CTF assessments, continuous parameters were compared using Mann\u2013Whitney U-test or repeated measures t -test, as appropriate. Categorical data were analyzed using Fisher's exact test. No significant demographic or physiologic differences between the CTF ( n = 24) and BTF ( n = 26) groups were seen. The immediate post-PEG 12-h epoch showed significantly lower GV and median TF volume for patients in the CTF group. All subsequent epochs (up to 18 days post-PEG) showed no differences in GV, insulin use, TF volume, or caloric intake. Insulin use for both groups increased when comparing the first 24 h post-PEG values to measurements from day 8. There were no differences in TF interruptions, time to \u226580% nutritional delivery goal, or hypoglycemic episodes. This study demonstrated no clinically relevant differences in GV, insulin use, TF volume or caloric intake between BTF and CTF groups. Despite some shortcomings, our data suggest that providers should not feel limited to BTF or CTF because of concerns for GV, time to goal nutrition, insulin use, or caloric intake, and should consider other factors such as resource utilization, ease of administration, and/or institutional/patient characteristics.",

    "abstract": "Breastfeeding mothers commonly experience nipple pain accompanied by radiating, stabbing or constant breast pain between feeds, sometimes associated with pink shiny nipple epithelium and white flakes of skin. Current guidelines diagnose these signs and symptoms as mammary candidiasis and stipulate antifungal medications. This study reviews existing research into the relationship between Candida albicans and nipple and breast pain in breastfeeding women who have been diagnosed with mammary candidiasis; whether fluconazole is an effective treatment; and the presence of C. albicans in the human milk microbiome. The author conducted three searches to investigate (a) breastfeeding-related pain and C. albicans ; (b) the efficacy of fluconazole in breastfeeding-related pain; and (c) composition of the human milk mycobiome. These findings are critiqued and integrated in a narrative review. There is little evidence to support the hypothesis that Candida spp, including C. albicans , in maternal milk or on the nipple-areolar complex causes the signs and symptoms popularly diagnosed as mammary candidiasis. There is no evidence that antifungal treatments are any more effective than the passage of time in women with these symptoms. Candida spp including C. albicans are commonly identified in healthy human milk and nipple-areolar complex mycobiomes. Clinical breastfeeding support remains a research frontier. The human milk microbiome, which includes a mycobiome, interacts with the microbiomes of the infant mouth and nipple-areolar complex, including their mycobiomes, to form protective ecosystems. Topical or oral antifungals may disrupt immunoprotective microbial homeostasis. Unnecessary use contributes to the serious global problem of antifungal resistance. Antifungal treatment is rarely indicated and prolonged courses cannot be justified in breastfeeding women experiencing breast and nipple pain. Multiple strategies for stabilizing microbiome feedback loops when nipple and breast pain emerge are required, in order to avoid overtreatment of breastfeeding mothers and their infants with antifungal medications.",

Understanding the factors contributing to the choices women on opioid substitution therapy make about infant feeding is important. The aim of this study was to better understand and support infant feeding choices and breastfeeding experiences in women on opioid substitution therapy. A systematic review was conducted on five databases: (1) Ovid MEDLINE(R) without revisions, (2) Ovid MEDLINE(R) In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, (3) EMBASE, (4) CINAHL, and (5) FRANCIS. From 1081 articles, 46 articles were reviewed. The literature supports breastfeeding as an appropriate and safe option for women on opioid substitution treatment. Breastfeeding and rooming-in reduce neonatal abstinence. Women face barriers to breastfeeding due to societal stigma and the lack of patient and health-care provider education. Efforts are needed to increase the knowledge that women and health-care professionals have about the safety and benefits of breastfeeding.",

    "abstract": "The nerve growth factor (NGF) belongs to the family of neurotrophic factors. Initially discovered as a signaling molecule involved in the survival, protection, differentiation, and proliferation of sympathetic and peripheral sensory neurons, it also participates in the regulation of the immune system and endocrine system. NGF biological activity is due to the binding of two classes of receptors: the tropomyosin-related kinase A (TrkA) and the low-affinity NGF pan-neurotrophin receptor p75. Alcohol Use Disorders (AUD) are one of the most frequent mental disorders in developed countries, characterized by heavy drinking, despite the negative effects of alcohol on brain development and cognitive functions that cause individual\u2019s work, medical, legal, educational, and social life problems. In addition, alcohol consumption during pregnancy disrupts the development of the fetal brain causing a wide range of neurobehavioral outcomes collectively known as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). The rationale of this review is to describe crucial findings on the role of NGF in humans and animals, when exposed to prenatal, chronic alcohol consumption, and on binge drinking.",

    "abstract": "Megestrol acetate is an effective treatment for improving appetite and increasing body weight in patients with cancer-associated anorexia. However, Megace \u00ae oral suspension (OS), a micronized formulation of megestrol acetate, has low bioavailability in the fasting state. To overcome this limitation, a nanocrystal formulation has been developed. This study was performed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of the nanocrystal formulation and to compare them with those of Megace \u00ae OS in the fed and fasting states. A randomized, open-label, two-treatment, two-period, two-sequence, crossover study was performed in three parts in 93 healthy subjects. A single 625 mg/5 mL oral dose of a nanocrystal formulation was administered in the fasting and fed states (part I). In parts II and III, a single 625 mg/5 mL oral dose of the nanocrystal formulation or Megace \u00ae OS 800 mg/20 mL was given in the fed and fasting states, respectively. Blood samples were collected for up to 120 hours post dose for pharmacokinetic analysis. Tolerability was evaluated throughout the entire study period. The nanocrystal formulation of megestrol acetate was rapidly absorbed in both the fed and fasting states. In the fed state, systemic exposure was comparable between the nanocrystal formulation of megestrol acetate and Megace \u00ae OS. In the fasting state, however, the peak plasma concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve to the last measurable concentration of megestrol acetate was 6.7-fold and 1.9-fold higher, respectively, for the nanocrystal formulation than for Megace \u00ae OS. No serious adverse events were reported. Systemic exposure to megestrol acetate is less affected by lack of concomitant food intake when it is administered using the nanocrystal formulation. The nanocrystal formulation of megestrol acetate could be more effective in treating patients with cachexia or anorexia.",

    "abstract": "Proton pump inhibitors strongly inhibit gastric acid production, but digestion problems do not generally arise. We can intake almost ordinary food even after total gastrectomy. Small intestine itself can digest and absorb food using various digestive enzymes without digestion in the stomach. The pH level of gastric acid in humans is much lower than that of most animals, and very close to that of carrion-eating animals called scavengers. It is assumed that ancient humans became bipedal approximately 4 million years ago. It was difficult for humans, who just started unstable bipedal locomotion, to catch quadrupedal-walking animals that can move faster, without special hunting tools. They may have eaten remaining carcasses, which is mainly the leftovers of carnivora species, as animal-derived food. The benefit to produce a volume of gastric acid for humans is carrion eating, in which disinfection by gastric acid is important. Humans produce a high concentration of gastric acid to enable consumption of a diet containing some bacteria and support this lifestyle by consuming significant energy to protect themselves from gastric acid. Now, the opportunity for strong deleterious bacteria to enter the gastrointestinal tract has decreased because of the organized clean environment. If this hygienic environment is maintained for a long time, our gastric acid level must be decreased gradually.",

Placement of the feeding tube through the pyloric ring and past the ligament of Treitz into the proximal jejunum is critical to reduce the risk of gastroesophageal regurgitation and microaspiration. We started utilizing transnasal endoscopy for intestinal feeding tube placement, placing enteral tubes for 40 patients between March 2008 and February 2009. Although we achieved a high success rate comparable to previous reports, we experienced several cases of failure, which was corrected with repeated endoscopy. Based on these experiences, we modified our method by adding a \u201ddouble-check\u201d transnasal endoscopy through the other nasal passage. After April 2010, we have placed the feeding tube by \u201ddouble-check\u201d method for all patients (more than 40 patients) who required transnasal endoscopic feeding tube placement.

Recent research is exploring the relationships between thin-ideal internalization and culture-specific factors that may be salient to women and men who live in the US but are marginalized based on racial or ethnic background, such as acculturation. This systematic review summarizes published articles examining the relationships among thin-ideal internalization, acculturation-related constructs (including assimilation, marginalization, biculturalism, and acculturative stress), and eating pathology in US adults. Following the PRISMA method, 15 empirical studies met inclusion criteria. Although existing literature was sparse and conflicting in large part due to heterogeneity in acculturation measures, results yielded some support for positive correlational relationships between acculturative stress, thin-ideal internalization, and eating pathology for both men and women (in 4 out of 5 relevant studies). Research on other aspects of acculturation (eg, integration, assimilation) is mixed, with some existing research suggesting a positive relationship and other research finding no statistically significant relationship. Future research would particularly benefit from a gold-standard, multidimensional transcultural measure of acculturation to examine how the acculturation process relates to thin-ideal internalization and eating pathology in ethnic and racial minorities in the US.",

This retrospective study determined the prognosis and outcome of electro-acupuncture on obese patients with BED. One hundred forty-three patients with BED and obesity were found from 658 people who participated in the scientific experiment of obesity treatment in Nanjing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine and Nanjing Brain Hospital from March 2015 to June 2018, and 84 patients (aged 18\u201340 years old) with valid data and uninterrupted treatment were found to be eligible for this retrospective study.

In this study, we analysed serum levels of tryptophan, serotonin and 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) in women with three different forms of amenorrhea: 16 patients were diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, 60 patients with functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, and 14 patients with hyperprolactinemia.

Serum Trp levels were significantly (P \u2264 0.05) lower in the anorexic (11.64 \u00b1 0.53 \u03bcg/ml, mean \u00b1 S.E.) than in the control (12.98 \u00b1 0.37 \u03bcg/ml) groups. In addition, in the anorexic group a statistical dispersion of Trp values was shown indicating a bimodal data distribution suggesting the existence of two different subgroups of patients. Regarding 5-HTP, an increase of its serum level was observed in all the groups with amenorrhea with the highest value in hyperprolactinemic patients. On the contrary, no statistical differences in serum 5-HT levels among the four analyzed groups were observed. This study shows that women affected by various forms of amenorrhea present an altered metabolism of tryptophan via serotonin and, in particular, markedly high differences are observed between the two subgroups of anorexic patients.",

    "abstract": "Methamphetamine (MA) and alcohol use disorders exhibit a high degree of co-morbidity and sequential alcohol-MA mixing increases risk for co-abuse. Recently, we reported greater MA-conditioned reward in male C57BL/6J mice with a prior history of binge alcohol-drinking (14\u2009days of 2-hour access to 5, 10, 20 and 40% alcohol). As female mice tend to binge-drink more alcohol than males and females tend to be more sensitive than males to the psychomotor-activating properties of MA, we first characterized the effects of binge-drinking upon MA-induced place-conditioning (four pairings of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, or 4\u2009mg/kg IP) in females and then incorporated our prior data to analyze for sex differences in MA-conditioned reward. Prior binge-drinking history did not significantly affect locomotor hyperactivity or its sensitization in female mice. However, the dose-response function for place-conditioning was shifted to the left of water-drinking controls, indicating an increase in sensitivity to MA-conditioned reward. The examination of sex differences revealed no sex differences in alcohol intake, although females exhibited greater MA-induced locomotor stimulation than males, irrespective of their prior drinking history. No statistically significant sex difference was apparent for the potentiation of MA-conditioned reward produced by prior binge-drinking history. If relevant to humans, these data argue that both males and females with a prior binge-drinking history are similarly vulnerable to MA abuse and it remains to be determined whether or not the neural substrates underpinning this increased vulnerability reflect common or sex-specific adaptations in reward-related brain regions.",

Heating of ham is improved by increased h values and direct absorption of US power. In this study, the convective heating/cooling process assisted by US irradiation is analyzed with the aims of developing a new convective heat transfer correlation. Heat transfer experiments were conducted with different copper machined geometries (cube, sphere and cylinder), fluid velocities (0.93\u20135.00\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010 \u22123 m/s), temperatures (5\u201360\u00a0\u00b0C), and US intensities (0\u20136913\u00a0W/m 2 ) using water as heat transfer fluid. The Nusselt ( Nu ) equation was obtained by assuming an apparent Nu number in the US-assisted process, expressed as the sum of contributions of the forced convection and cavitation-acoustic streaming effects. The Nu equation was validated with two sets of experiments conducted with a mixture of ethylene glycol and water (1:1 V/V) or a CaCl 2 aqueous solution (30\u00a0g/L) as immersion media, achieving a satisfactory reproduction of experimental data, with mean relative deviations of 17.6 and 17.8%, respectively. In addition, a conduction model with source term and the proposed correlation were applied to the analysis of US-accelerated heating kinetics of dry-cured ham reported in literature. Results demonstrated that US improves heating of ham slices because of the increased heat transfer coefficients and the direct absorption of US power by the foodstuff.",

Family-based treatment (FBT) has emerged as an effective intervention for adolescents with anorexia nervosa, and preliminary evidence suggests that it may be efficacious in the treatment of adolescents with bulimia nervosa. Multifamily therapy for anorexia nervosa provides a more intensive experience for families needing additional support. This review outlines the three phases of treatment, key tenets of family-based treatment, and empirical support for FBT. In addition, FBT in higher levels of care is described, as well as challenges in the implementation of FBT and recent adaptations to FBT, including offering additional support to eating-disorder caregivers. Future research is needed to identify families for whom FBT does not work, determine adaptations to FBT that may increase its efficacy, develop ways to improve treatment adherence among clinicians, and find ways to support caregivers better during treatment.",

    "abstract": "A relationship between bulimia nervosa and reward-related behavior is supported by several lines of evidence. The dopaminergic dysfunctions in the processing of reward-related stimuli have been shown to be modulated by the neurotrophin brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the hormone leptin. Using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design, a reward learning task was applied to study the behavior of 20 female subjects with remitted bulimia nervosa and 27 female healthy controls under placebo and catecholamine depletion with alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine (AMPT). The plasma levels of BDNF and leptin were measured twice during the placebo and the AMPT condition, immediately before and 1 hour after a standardized breakfast. AMPT\u2013induced differences in plasma BDNF levels were positively correlated with the AMPT\u2013induced differences in reward learning in the whole sample ( P =.05). Across conditions, plasma brain derived neurotrophic factor levels were higher in remitted bulimia nervosa subjects compared with controls (diagnosis effect; P =.001). Plasma BDNF and leptin levels were higher in the morning before compared with after a standardized breakfast across groups and conditions (time effect; P <.0001). The plasma leptin levels were higher under catecholamine depletion compared with placebo in the whole sample (treatment effect; P =.0004). This study reports on preliminary findings that suggest a catecholamine-dependent association of plasma BDNF and reward learning in subjects with remitted bulimia nervosa and controls. A role of leptin in reward learning is not supported by this study. However, leptin levels were sensitive to a depletion of catecholamine stores in both remitted bulimia nervosa and controls.",

The aim of this study was to investigate BMI trajectory according to BW status and the protective effect of breastfeeding on the prevalence of overweight/obesity in children 6 years of age. A retrospective cohort study was conducted between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2016 utilizing data from the National Health Information Database of Korea. The 38,049 subjects were followed until the end of 2016, providing that subjects were completely eligible for all health check-ups from birth to 6 years of age. At each check-up period, multiple logistic regressions were used to investigate the association between BW status (low birth weight [LBW], normal birth weight [NBW], high birth weight [HBW]) and growth development. HBW infants were highly likely to be overweight/obese compared to NBW infants (odds ratio [OR], 1.70\u20132.35) and LBW infants were highly likely to be underweight (OR, 1.69\u20132.20) through 6 years of age. The risk of overweight/obesity decreased significantly if HBW infants were breast-fed for 6 months (OR, 0.54\u20130.76). HBW status is associated with overweight/obesity during early childhood. Exclusive breastfeeding is a significant protective factor against overweight/obesity in children with HBW.",

The study was conducted on 219 normal glucose tolerance (NGT) subjects and 44 GDM subjects by using a questionnaire including dietary behavior, food frequency and 3-day food record. The mean age, OGTT, and delivery weight of GDM subjects were statistically higher than those in NGT. A larger proportion of NGT subjects consumed black coffee (49.8%) while the majority of GDM subjects (61.4%) drank mixed coffee with sugar and cream. Dairy products were the most frequently consumed snack item in NGT subjects (40.7%), while fruits were most frequently consumed food item in GDM subjects (34.4%). Many of NGT subjects (49.8%) answered that they hardly took night-eating snacks whereas most of GDM subjects (61.4%) took night-eating snacks more than once a week. For change of taste preference, the proportion of NGT subjects who showed less preference for salty taste (33.3%) or greasy taste (16.9%) was higher than that of GDM subjects (11.4%). Nutrient intakes of energy, fat, cholesterol, saturated fatty acid (SFA), monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA), polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA), carbohydrate, vitamin B 1 , vitamin B 2 , vitamin C, and vitamin E in GDM group were significantly higher than those in NGT group. Nutrient densities of SFA and vitamin C in GDM group were higher and nutrient density of calcium was lower than those in NGT group. Taken together, it is recommended to reduce night-eating snack and choose less salty and fatty foods, black-coffee rather than coffee with cream and sugar, and more dairy products to prevent GDM.",

Many health issues surround adolescent mothers and their infants, many of which can be addressed through behavioral change. The main purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility, acceptability, usability, and relevance of momHealth, an innovative multiple health behavior change (MHBC) education and support mHealth intervention, focused on breastfeeding, healthy eating and active living, and depression prevention among pregnant and parenting adolescents. We also evaluated the proposed online surveys and physical outcome measures for feasibility and acceptability (burden, time, ease of use). A one-group quasi-experimental longitudinal design was used to examine the intervention components and the breastfeeding, diet/activity, and depression outcome measures. Nine iPad-delivered education modules, text messaging, and virtual individual and group support were provided for 12 weeks, beginning at 32 weeks of pregnancy, with follow-up to three months postpartum. Data on the main behaviors and outcomes were collected at three in-home visits, one telephone call soon after birth, and ten postpartum weekly and biweekly online surveys. Although recruitment and attrition presented challenges, six participants enrolled in the study during prenatal clinic visits; all were pregnant with their first child, single, and had a mean age of 17.7 years (SD = 1.4). Intervention participation ranged from 59% to 91% for educational module completion, text message reading, and individual virtual support meetings and three virtual peer support groups were held. Intervention acceptability, relevance, and delivery was supported by reports of clear and relevant content, reasonable time burden, iPad ease of use, and acceptable intervention length. Data collection was reported as convenient and non-burdensome, but the diet recall method and activity monitoring challenged some. This was the first MHBC research in adolescent pregnant women designed to improve breastfeeding outcomes, healthy eating/active living, and depression prevention. Findings demonstrated strengths and challenges of the interventions and methods, support feasibility and acceptability of momHealth, and informed the recruitment and intervention protocols of our pilot randomized trial.",

    "abstract": "Studies have focused on the effects of chronic alcohol consumption and the mechanisms of tissue injury underlying alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis, with less focus on the pathophysiological consequences of binge alcohol consumption. Alcohol binge drinking prevalence continues to rise, particularly among individuals ages 18 to 24. However, it is also frequent in individuals ages 65 and older. High blood alcohol levels achieved with this pattern of alcohol consumption are of particular concern, as alcohol can permeate to virtually all tissues in the body, resulting in significant alterations in organ function, which leads to multisystemic pathophysiological consequences. In addition to the pattern, amount, and frequency of alcohol consumption, additional factors, including the type of alcoholic beverage, may contribute differentially to the risk for alcohol-induced tissue injury. Preclinical and translational research strategies are needed to enhance our understanding of the effects of binge alcohol drinking, particularly for individuals with a history of chronic alcohol consumption. Identification of underlying pathophysiological processes responsible for tissue and organ injury can lead to development of preventive or therapeutic interventions to reduce the health care burden associated with binge alcohol drinking.",

    "abstract": "Eating disorders, especially anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa have been classically described in young females in Western population. Recent research shows that they are also seen in developing countries including India. The classification of eating disorders has been expanded to include recently described conditions like binge eating disorder. Eating disorders have a multifactorial etiology. Genetic factor appear to play a major role. Recent advances in neurobiology have improved our understanding of these conditions and may possibly help us develop more effective treatments in future. Premorbid personality appears to play an important role, with differential predisposition for individual disorders. The role of cultural factors in the etiology of these conditions is debated. Culture may have a pathoplastic effect leading to non-conforming presentations like the non fat-phobic form of anorexia nervosa, which are commonly reported in developing countries. With rapid cultural transformation, the classical forms of these conditions are being described throughout the world. Diagnostic criteria have been modified to accommodate for these myriad presentations. Treatment of eating disorders can be quite challenging, given the dearth of established treatments and poor motivation/insight in these conditions. Nutritional rehabilitation and psychotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment, while pharmacotherapy may be helpful in specific situations.",

    "abstract": "Purpose: Breastfeeding alters the breast microenvironment, and several lines of evidence suggest the breast microenvironment contributes to the clinical phenotype of inflammatory breast cancer. We investigated breastfeeding history as a modifier of locoregional recurrence (LRR), distant metastasis (DM), disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS) in parous women with inflammatory breast cancer. Methods: Parous women with inflammatory breast cancer were identified from a prospective registry at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. We compared patient and tumor characteristics, LRR, DM, DFS, and OS patients with (BF+) and without (BF-) a history of breastfeeding. Results: Eighty-two patients were included. At a median follow-up of 50 months, BF+ patients had significantly lower risk of LRR (9.0% vs. 23.6%; p=0.01), a lower risk of DM (26.8% vs. 53.8%; p=0.008), and better DFS (73.1% vs. 48.1%; p=0.006) than BF- patients. On multivariate analysis, BF+ history was associated with significantly lower risk of DM (hazard ratio 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.15-0.97; p=0.04) and better DFS (hazard ratio 0.37, 95% confidence interval 0.15-0.93; p=0.04) after adjusting for established predictive and prognostic variables. The prognostic significance of breastfeeding may be most pronounced in women with triple-negative IBC. Conclusion: A lack of breastfeeding history in parous women with inflammatory breast cancer may predict worse prognosis. We speculate that breastfeeding-induced alterations in the breast microenvironment may alter the aggressiveness of inflammatory breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Vaccination is one of the most common painful procedures in infants. Despite the irreparable consequences and complications of acute pain in infants, and existence of pharmacological and non-pharmacological methods for pain control, pain control in infants has received less attention. Therefore, this research aimed to compare the vaccination-related pain in infants younger than 6 months who receive vapocoolant spray and breastfeeding during injection, in order to suggest a strategy to provide emotional, mental, and physical health for infants. This is a randomized clinical trial study on 144 infants less than 6 months of age, referred to Ibn Sina Health Care Center in 2009, who were selected by convenience sampling. Forty-eight infants were allocated through systematic random sampling to each study group (i.e., breastfeeding, vapocoolant spray, and control group). Inclusion criteria were: Fully conscious infants, lack of any disease (sensory, motor abnormalities, cold, etc.), taking no medication, exclusive breastfeeding, vaccination for hepatitis B and DTP, regular visits to health care center, infants with Iranian nationality, and quiet infants who did not cry. The infant was excluded if he/she was crying and it was impossible to make him/her quiet before injection. Data were gathered by a questionnaire (six questions) and checklist [neonatal infant pain scale (NIPS)]. Data were analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistical methods through SPSS. The findings suggest that breastfeeding during vaccination has a more analgesic effect on vaccination pain, compared to application of vapocoolant spray before vaccination. In 64.6% of the infants, breastfeeding during vaccination caused analgesia, while 25% of the infants who received vapocoolant spray experienced analgesic effect. There was a significant difference in pain between the infants who received vapocoolant spray and those on breastfeeding during injection ( P < 0.001). It seems that breastfeeding during vaccination in infants under 6 months of age is an effective, natural, safe, accessible, and inexpensive method without side effects to reduce vaccination-related pain.",

One of the global targets set by the WHO to improve maternal, infant, and young child nutrition is to increase the rate of exclusive breast-feeding \u201cin the first 6 months\u201d up to at least 50% by 2025. 3 Thus, as a global endeavor to promote and sustain breastfeeding, the WHO and UNICEF launched the Baby-friendly Hospital Initiative (BFHI) 1 year after the Innocenti Declaration of 1990. Regarding the State of Qatar, there was a 34% rate of early initiation of breastfeeding \u201cwithin the first hour of birth\u201d and a 29% rate of exclusive breastfeeding between 2010 and 2015. In Qatar during 2016, many obstacles in achieving the aforementioned global target remained. In addition, there are still no hospitals with a BFHI accreditation.",

Heat has been studied as a phytosanitary treatment to replace chemical fumigation for controlling this pest. Information on kinetics for thermal mortality of C. cephalonica is needed for developing effective postharvest phytosanitary thermal treatments of walnuts. Thermal death kinetics of fifth-instar C. cephalonica were investigated at temperatures between 44\u00b0C and 50\u00b0C at a heating rate of 5\u00b0C min \u22121 using a heating block system. The results showed that thermal-death curves for C. cephalonica larvae followed a 0 order of kinetic reaction. The time to reach 100% mortality decreased with increasing temperature from 150\u2009min at 44\u00b0C to 2.5\u2009min at 50\u00b0C. The activation energy for controlling C. cephalonica was 466\u2013592\u2009kJ/mol, and the z value obtained from the thermal death time curve was 3.3\u00b0C. This kinetic model prediction could be useful in designing the thermal treatment protocol for controlling C. cephalonica in walnuts .",

    "abstract": "Various socio-cultural factors influence infant feeding practices and thus early childhood nutrition and child survival in India. This study aimed to examine the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding, its promoters and barriers in urban slums of Bihar, India. We conducted a community based cross-sectional survey involving 297 mothers living in slum settlements in Bihar. Data were collected using structured questionnaire on exclusive breastfeeding practices, and the factors that could influence this. Descriptive analysis was done to estimate the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding and regression model was performed to identify the predictors of exclusive breastfeeding. Only 23% of mothers initiate breastfeeding within 1 hour of delivery and 27.6% mothers practise exclusive breastfeeding up to six months. Mother's education was found to be associated with duration of exclusive breastfeeding (OR 11, 95% CI 2-59). Term babies were more likely to be breastfed exclusively for six months than pre-term babies (OR 8.6, 95% CI 1.6-47.6). Antenatal care visits and completing immunization were significantly associated with duration of exclusive breastfeeding ( P < 0.001). The majority of mothers acquire exclusive breastfeeding knowledge through television/radio (OR 68, 95% CI 5.5-832.5) and newspaper advertisements (OR 14, 95% CI 2.6-76). Prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding up to six months of age and early initiation of breastfeeding remains low in slums of Bihar. Exclusive breastfeeding and early initiation of breastfeeding rates could be improved by educating and counselling mothers during health facility contacts by primary care providers.",

The aim of the current study was, using an automatic short-trough sensor liquid feeding system, to identify the water-to-feed ratio at which growth was maximized and feed was most efficiently converted to live-weight. Two experiments were conducted in which four commercially used water-to-feed ratios were fed: 2.4:1, 3.0:1, 3.5:1, and 4.1:1 on a dry matter (DM) basis (the equivalent of 2:1, 2.5:1, 3.0:1, and 3.5:1 on a fresh matter basis). Each experiment comprised 216 pigs, penned in groups of 6 same sex (entire male and female) pigs/pen with a total of 9 pen replicates per treatment. The first experiment lasted 62 days (from 40.6 to 102.2 kg at slaughter) and the second experiment was for 76 days (from 31.8 to 119.6 kg at slaughter). Overall, in Exp. 1, FE was 0.421, 0.420, 0.453, and 0.448 (s.e. 0.0081 g/g; P < 0.01) for pigs fed at 2.4:1, 3.0:1, 3.5:1, and 4.1:1, respectively. Overall, in Exp. 2, average daily gain was 1,233, 1,206, 1,211, and 1,177 (s.e. 12.7 g/day; P < 0.05) for pigs fed at 2.4:1, 3.0:1, 3.5:1, and 4.1:1, respectively. At slaughter, in Exp. 1, dressing percentage was 76.7, 76.6, 76.7, and 75.8 (s.e. 0.17%; P < 0.01) for 2.4:1, 3.0:1, 3.5:1, and 4.1:1, respectively. There were no differences between treatment groups for DM, organic matter, nitrogen, gross energy, or ash digestibilities. These findings indicate that liquid feeding a diet prepared at a water-to-feed ratio of 3.5:1 maximizes FE of growing-finishing pigs without negatively affecting dressing percentage. Therefore, preparing liquid feed for growing-finishing pigs at a water-to-feed ratio of 3.5:1 DM is our recommendation for a short-trough liquid feeding system.",

Disturbances of body image perception are considered to be one of the central aspects of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. There is growing evidence that body image distortion can be associated with changes in pain perception. The aim of our study was to examine the associations between body image perception, body dissatisfaction, and nociception in women with eating disorders and age-matched healthy control women. We measured body dissatisfaction and pain sensitivity in 61 patients with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition diagnoses of eating disorders (31 anorexia nervosa and 30 bulimia nervosa) and in 30 healthy women. Thermal pain threshold latencies were evaluated using an analgesia meter and body image perception and body dissatisfaction were assessed using Anamorphic Micro software (digital pictures of their own body distorted into larger-body and thinner-body images). Patients with eating disorders overestimated their body size in comparison with healthy controls, but the two groups did not differ in body dissatisfaction. In anorexia and bulimia patient groups, body dissatisfaction (calculated in pixels as desired size/true image size) correlated with pain threshold latencies ( r =0.55, p =0.001), while between body image perception (determined as estimation size/true image size) and pain threshold, no correlation was found. Thus, we demonstrated that in patients with eating disorders, pain perception is significantly associated with emotional contrary to sensory (visual) processing of one\u2019s own body image. The more the patients desired to be thin, the more pain-sensitive they were. Our findings based on some shared mechanisms of body dissatisfaction and pain perception support the significance of negative emotions specific for eating disorders and contribute to better understanding of the psychosomatic characteristics of this spectrum of illnesses.",

    "abstract": "Feeding broiler breeders to satiety has negative consequences on their health and reproduction. Alternative feeding strategies during rearing can improve welfare, although their implications during lay are not well understood. The objective was to examine the effect of rearing feeding treatments on the reproductive performance and feeding behavior of broiler breeders under simulated commercial conditions. At 3 wk of age, 1,680 Ross 308 pullets were allocated to 24 pens under 1 of 4 isocaloric treatments: 1) daily control diet; 2) daily alternative diet (40% soybean hulls and 1 to 5% calcium propionate); 3) 4/3 control diet (4 on-feed days, 3 non-consecutive off-feed days per week); and 4) graduated control diet. Feeding frequency of the graduated treatment varied with age and finished on a daily basis. At 23 wk of age, group sizes were adjusted to 40 hens, and 5 mature Yield Plus Males roosters were introduced to each pen. Pens were under the same daily feeding management and same diet during lay. The performance of broiler breeders (growth rate, body weight uniformity, and reproductive performance) was determined until 64 wk of age. At the end of lay, feeding motivation was examined with a feed intake test and a compensatory feeding test. Data were analyzed using linear mixed regression models, with pen nested in the models and age as a repeated measure. The laying rate of hens reared on the graduated treatment decreased slower compared to control hens, resulting in a higher cumulative egg production (178.2 \u00b1 3.8 eggs/hen) than control hens (165.2 \u00b1 3.8 eggs/hen, P < 0.01) by 64 wk of age. Hens reared on non-daily feeding treatments laid lighter eggs with relatively heavier yolks and had higher feed intake at the end of lay than hens fed daily during rearing ( P = 0.02). In conclusion, rearing feeding treatments impacted the growth rate and body weight uniformity during lay, feeding motivation at the end of lay, and the laying rate and hatchability depending on hens\u2019 age.",

However, neurosarcoidosis occurring only in the medulla oblongata is very rare and lacks specific imaging and clinical features. We report a rare case of neurosarcoidosis arising from the medulla oblongata alone, suggesting the significance of pathological findings for accurate diagnosis. A 78-year-old woman with a history of rheumatoid arthritis was admitted to our hospital with a 3-month history of progressive numbness in bilateral lower extremities and gait disturbance. Neurological examination on admission showed mild bilateral paired paralysis of the lower limbs (manual muscle test: right 2/V; left 4/V) and marked numbness in the right lower limb. Neuroimaging revealed a solid mass with clear boundaries in the dorsal medulla oblongata appearing hypointense on T1-weighted imaging (WI), hyperintense on T2-WI, and hypointense on diffusion WI (DWI), with strong enhancement on gadolinium-enhanced T1-WI. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed moderately elevated levels of protein and lymphocytic cells. Biopsy to determine the exact diagnosis revealed histological findings of noncaseating epithelioid granulomas and inflammatory infiltration, consistent with sarcoidosis. Postoperatively, corticosteroid therapy with prednisolone was initiated as soon as possible, resulting in marked reductions in lesion size. Follow-up neuroimaging after 12 months showed no signs of recurrence. Neurosarcoidosis is difficult to diagnose from routine neuroimaging and laboratory findings. Accurate diagnosis requires careful identification of clinical signs, hypointensity on DWI, and morphological findings from surgical biopsy.",

To explore the relationship between obesity, eating attitude, and body image satisfaction among students and employees at Princess Nourah University (PNU) and to compare the different modalities of assessing body weight. A cross-sectional study using a convenient sampling technique comprised of 550 participants. Obesity was assessed by anthropometric measurements and body composition monitor (BF511). Eating attitude test (EAT26) was used to determine eating attitude while body image satisfaction score was determined using body shape questionnaire (BSQ). Around 382 (69.5%) students and 168 employees participated in the study. Obesity was significantly higher among employees (48.2%) vs students (27.7%) ( P < 0.001). Body fat composition showed significant positive correlations ranging from weak-to-moderate (0.13 to 0.44) with other body measurements for students and employees. The disordered eating attitude was maximized among obese compared to other BMI groups ( P < 0.05). Percentage of disordered eating attitude score correlated positively with BMI: 35.2% vs 52.3% among underweight and obese, respectively ( P = 0.001). There was no statistical difference in eating attitudes between students and employees. BSQ score correlates positively with BMI ( P < 0.001), it was 36.73 \u00b1 18.68 vs 57.92 \u00b1 18.50 for underweight and obese, respectively. The effect of BMI on body image score was 19.1%.

Three growing male goats (initial body weight [BW] of 22.4\u00b10.9 kg) and three growing male deer (initial BW of 20.2\u00b14.8 kg) were each allotted to a respiration-metabolism chamber for an adaptation period of 7 d and a data collection period of 3 d. An experimental diet was offered to each animal at one of three feeding levels (1.5%, 2.0%, and 2.5% of BW) in a 3\u00d73 Latin square design. The chambers were used for measuring enteric CH 4 emission. Nutrient digestibility decreased linearly in goats as feeding level increased, whereas Sika deer digestibility was not affected by feeding level. The enteric production of CH 4 expressed as g/kg dry matter intake (DMI), g/kg organic matter intake, and % of gross energy intake decreased linearly with increased feeding level in goats; however, that of Sika deer was not affected by feeding level. Six equations were estimated for predicting the enteric CH 4 emission from goats and Sika deer. For goat, equation 1 was found to be of the highest accuracy: CH 4 (g/d) = 6.2 (\u00b114.1)+10.2 (\u00b17.01)\u00d7DMI (kg/d)+0.0048 (\u00b10.0275)\u00d7dry matter digestibility (DMD, g/kg)\u20130.0070 (\u00b10.0187)\u00d7neutral detergent fiber digestibility (NDFD; g/kg).

    "abstract": "Preconception behaviors and experiences of mothers and fathers can affect future offspring. Recently, our laboratory showed that alcohol-naive offspring of parents who were exposed to repeated binge alcohol during adolescence showed altered DNA methylation patterns in the hypothalamus, a brain region involved in regulation of pubertal development, stress, and behavior. These observations have potentially far-reaching consequences for human health, as more than 4.6 million Americans under the age of 21 years report engaging in the rapid intoxication behavior of binge-pattern alcohol (EtOH) drinking. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that offspring of binge EtOH\u2012exposed parents would have altered hypothalamic function manifested phenotypically as improper pubertal development, impaired socialization, and dysregulated stress response. In addition, we tested the hypothesis that parental EtOH exposure would confer adaptive protection from the negative effects of EtOH when offspring were themselves exposed to EtOH. Rats received EtOH via oral gavage once daily for 6 days at both early [postnatal day (PND) 37] and late puberty (PND 67). Animals were paired (EtOH-EtOH, vehicle-vehicle) for mating 24 hours after the last EtOH dose. After weaning, offspring were randomized to vehicle treatment to assess changes in normal development or to EtOH treatment to assess the effect of parental EtOH exposure on offspring response to this treatment. We found that offspring had smaller body weights and displayed fewer play behaviors when parents had been exposed to EtOH before conception. In addition, offspring showed a reduction in pubertal development markers that could indicate that parental preconception EtOH exposure confers maladaptive epigenetic traits in first-generation offspring. We characterized alterations in offspring hypothalamic function caused by parental preconception alcohol exposure along with the effect of parental alcohol on offspring response to alcohol treatment.",

All consecutive patients who underwent total gastrectomy for gastric cancer with jejunostomy placement were included from a prospective single-center database (2003\u20132014). Jejunostomy-related complications and postoperative weight changes were evaluated up to 12 months after surgery. Multivariable linear regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with weight loss 12 months after gastrectomy. Of 113 patients operated in the study period, 65 received JTF after total gastrectomy for a median duration of 18 d [interquartile range (IQR), 10\u201355 d]. Jejunostomy-related complications occurred in 11 (17%) patients, including skin leakage (n=3) and peritoneal leakage (n=2), luxation (n=3), occlusion (n=2), infection (n=1) and torsion (n=1). In 2 (3%) patients, a reoperation was needed due to jejunostomy-related complications. The mean preoperative weight of patients was 71.8 kg (100%), and remained stable during JTF (73.9 kg, 103%, P=0.331). After JTF was stopped, the mean weight of patients decreased to 64.9 kg (90%) at 12 months after surgery (P<0.001). A high preoperative body mass index (BMI) (\u226525 kg/m 2 ) was associated with high postoperative weight loss compared to patients with a low BMI (<25 kg/m 2 ) (16.3% vs . 8.6%, P=0.016). JTF can prevent weight loss in the early postoperative phase. However, this is at the prize of possible complications. As weight loss in the long term is not prevented, routine JTF should be re-evaluated and balanced against the selected use in preoperatively malnourished patients. Special attention should be paid to patients with a high preoperative BMI, who are at risk of more postoperative weight loss.",

This was done to inform the development of a pathway based eating quality system for pork. Estimated means of explanatory variables were obtained for those pathway factors where sufficient published studies met the criteria for inclusion in the analysis. Due to a lack of data for interactions between factors investigated, only single factors were included as fixed terms in the REML models. This analysis identified that moisture infusion ( P < 0.001), ageing for more than 2 d post-slaughter ( P = 0.006) and tenderstretching ( P = 0.006) each resulted in significant improvements in tenderness. Cooking loins to an endpoint temperature of \u2265 80\u00b0C negatively impacted both tenderness ( P = 0.022) and juiciness ( P < 0.001) scores compared with 70 to 74\u00b0C.

While it might seem obvious that science would regulate itself scientifically, the consensus on peer review is eroding; a deeper understanding of its workings and potential alternatives is sorely needed. Employing a theoretical approach supported by agent-based simulation, we examined computational models of peer review, performing what we propose to call redesign , that is, the replication of simulations using different mechanisms . Here, we show that we are able to obtain the high sensitivity to rational cheating that is present in literature. In addition, we also show how this result appears to be fragile against small variations in mechanisms. Therefore, we argue that exploration of the parameter space is not enough if we want to support theoretical statements with simulation, and that exploration at the level of mechanisms is needed. These findings also support prudence in the application of simulation results based on single mechanisms, and endorse the use of complex agent platforms that encourage experimentation of diverse mechanisms.",

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of regular binge drinking on BP , lipid and glucose levels and to determine if there were differences in these associations between men and women. We analyzed data from NHANES (the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) for men and women 18 to 45 years old who were non\u2013binge drinkers, binge drank 1 to 12 times, or binge drank >12 times in the past year. After controlling for diet and physical activity, both categories of men binge drinkers compared with non\u2013binge drinkers had higher systolic BP (121.8 and 119.0\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg versus 117.5\u00a0mm\u00a0Hg) and total cholesterol (215.5 and 217.9\u00a0mg/dL versus 207.8\u00a0mg/dL) values. There were no effects of binge drinking on systolic BP or total cholesterol in women. Binge drinking in men and women was associated with higher high\u2010density lipoprotein\u2010cholesterol values. The effects of binge drinking on glucose parameters in men and women were variable. Compared with young adult women, repeated binge drinking in men was associated with an elevated systolic BP , and greater frequency of binge drinking in men was associated with a more unfavorable lipid profile. In young adults with elevated systolic BP , practitioners should consider the possible role of binge drinking and address the importance of reducing alcohol intake as an important cardiovascular risk reduction strategy.",

This can cause acute inflammatory arthritis. The 2015 ACR/EULAR criteria for the diagnosis of gout include dual energy computed tomography (DECT)-demonstrated monosodium urate crystals as a new criterion. DECT is a spectral decomposition that permits recognition of different types of tissues based on their characteristic energy-dependent photon attenuation. A positive scan is defined as the presence of urate at articular or periarticular sites. We describe a 51-year-old woman known to have anorexia nervosa. During our clinical examination, we detected plenty of tophi on both hands, but no swollen joints. The diagnosis of gout was made by visualizing crystals in a biopsy from a tophus. The first line of treatment was allopurinol, the second line was rasburicase, and the current treatment is febuxostat 80 mg/day, allopurinol 300 mg twice a day, and colchicine 0.5 mg twice a day. The patient has unchanged arthralgia and the size and number of tophi remain the same as before treatment in spite of active treatment for 3 years. Previously the patient had problems with adherence, but now she claims that she follows the proposed treatment. The last plasma urate (P-urate) was 0.57 mmol/L. Following two years of treatment, DECT of hands visualized monosodium urate crystal deposits in the tophi, as seen on the clinical photos, but also crystals in relation to the tendons and soft tissue. DECT is an imaging modality useful to assess urate crystal deposits at diagnosis of gout and could be considered during treatment evaluation. Lack of adherence to treatment should be considered when P-urate values vary significantly and when DECT scans over years persistently visualize monosodium urate crystals.",

Socio-psychology, eating behavior, quality of diet and quality of life data were assessed in 114 women (mean age: 34.5 \u00b1 8.09 years). NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-RS) and coping styles questionnaire were used to assess socio-psychology variables, and eating behavior was assessed using the Eating Attitudes Test-26 (EAT-26), Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ), and General Food Craving Questionnaire Test (G-FCQ-T). Quality of diet was analyzed by Diet Quality Index-international (DQI-I), and obesity-related quality of life was evaluated using the Korean Obesity-related Quality of life Scale (KOQOL). Significant differences were in the psychological variables and eating behaviors in the obese group than the normal and overweight groups (p < 0.05). The overall score of DQI-I was significantly lower in the obese group than that of their counterparts (p < 0.05). BMI was positively correlated with neuroticism, emotional eating, and obesity-related quality of life, and negatively correlated with diet quality. Neuroticism was positively correlated with emotional eating and food craving. Emotional eating was positively correlated with obesity-related quality of life. In conclusion, women with a higher BMI had significantly more problematic eating behaviors, poor diet quality and quality of life.",

Although adopting the best feeding option for HIV-exposed infants is one of the factors that impact PMTCT outcomes, there is limited data on the assessment of PMTCT success rates based on antiretroviral interventions and feeding options. This study assesses the success rate of PMTCT service based on antiretroviral interventions and feeding options. Eighty-five HIV-infected mothers previously in care were enrolled in a prospective cohort study. Folders and structured questionnaires were used to extract data on mother-infant pair and the first CD4, count of infected mothers on enrolment at PMTCT clinic. Dry blood spot samples were obtained from exposed infants for early infant diagnosis. Results were analyzed using the SPSS software. The mean age of enrolled mothers was 31.3 \u00b1 4.4 years, and an average CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of 368.6 \u00b1 216.2 cells/\u00b5l. Seven (8.2%) of the HIV-exposed infants were positive for HIV-1 based on early infant diagnosis results. Overall PMTCT success rate (PMTCTSR) was 91.8%. HIV-1 prevalence of 5.0%, 0% and 21.1% was found among infants of patients who opted for breastfeeding, replacement feeding, and mixed feeding respectively thus yielding PMTCT success rates of 95%, 100% and 78.9%. Pediatric antiretroviral interventions success rates in HIV-exposed infants was 95.8%, 80.0% and 66.7% based on age groups \u2264 6 months, > 6 \u2264 12 months, and > 12 \u2264 18 months respectively. Quality PMTCT service is vital for successful prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Implementation of more dynamic approaches such as adherence to option B+ guidelines in PMTCT service in our settings can further reduce mother-to-child transmission of HIV and improve outcomes.",

A cross-sectional study was conducted on 1,104 healthy adolescents, mean age of 15.8 \u00b1 1.24 years. Dietary intake was measured with the 24-hour dietary recall method, and dietary quality was assessed by means of the HEI-2005. Diet quality scores ranged from 23.7 to 77.5. The mean score was found to be 51.5 \u00b1 9.07 according to the HEI-2005. There were no differences according to gender; 42.8% had a poor diet and 57.2% had a diet that needs improvement. No subjects had a \"good diet\". Lower mean subgroup scores were found for whole grains, total vegetables, total fruits, dairy products, and meat and beans. Fruits and vegetables scores were significantly high in girls, whereas sodium, oil, and meat and beans scores were significantly high in boys. Total HEI-2005 scores were increasingly associated with parental education level when age and gender were adjusted. There was a negative correlation between HEI-2005 scores and age, total energy intake, and fat intake. Positive correlation was only observed in the HEI-2005 scores for protein and dietary fibre intakes. Consequently, the overall diet quality and nutritional habits of Turkish adolescents need modification and improvement. In the family, measures should be initiated by the government, including advertisements and campaigns.",

A PubMed search restricted to titles and abstracts of English-language reviews, meta-analyses, clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, journal articles, and letters using human participants was conducted on August 7, 2015, using keywords that included \u201cbinge eating disorder,\u201d DSM-5, DSM-IV , guilt, shame, embarrassment, quantity, psychological, behavior, and \u201cshape and weight concerns.\u201d Of the 257 retrieved publications, 60 publications were considered relevant to discussions related to DSM-5 diagnostic criteria and were included in the current review, and 20 additional references were also included on the basis of the authors\u2019 knowledge and/or on a review of the reference lists from relevant articles obtained through the literature search. Evidence supports the duration/frequency criterion for BED and the primary importance of loss of control and marked distress in identifying individuals with BED. Although overvaluation of shape/weight is not a diagnostic criterion, its relationship to the severity of BED psychopathology may identify a unique subset of individuals with BED. Additionally, individuals with BED often exhibit a clinical profile consisting of psychiatric (eg, mood, obsessive\u2013compulsive, and impulsive disorders) and medical (eg, gastrointestinal symptoms, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes) comorbidities and behavioral profiles (eg, overconsumption of calories outside of a binge eating episode and emotional eating). Future revisions of the BED diagnostic criteria should consider the inclusion of BED subtypes, perhaps based on the overvaluation of shape/weight, and an evidence-based reassessment of severity criteria.",

Male newborns were prevalent (74%). More than half were born by Cesarian section and had Apgar scores with a median of 9. Macrosomes are prone to complications at birth and in our study those were mainly hypoglycemia and birth trauma. Time at first feeding was 95 minutes (mean), with a high percentage of formula/mixed feeding (68%). Macrosomia itself attracts the risk of birth by cesarean section (54% of study group), birth trauma and a low rate of exclusive breast milk feeding (32% of study group) at discharge.",

This follow\u2010up study obtained longitudinal data from a sample of parents in the United States to quantify changes in food security status, the home food environment, and parent feeding practices, from before to across COVID\u201019 as the pandemic continued to persist. Parents ( N =\u00a0433) completed online surveys May ( T 1) and September ( T 2) 2020 during COVID\u201019. Food security, home food environment, and parent feeding practices were reported at each timepoint. At T 1, parents also retrospectively reported on these factors pertaining to before COVID\u201019. Chi square analyses and repeated measure mixed models examined associations among study variables. Low or very low food security increased from before COVID\u201019 (37%) to T 1 (54%) and decreased by T 2 (45%).

Adolescents face special problems that are less common during childhood. Several studies indicate that the prevalence of eating disorders has been increased among adolescents. The aim of the present study was to investigate the occurrence, prevalence and correlates of eating disorders (ED) among adolescents in two cities of Iran, Urmia and Tabriz. This was a cross-sectional survey in which 1990 adolescent boys and girls were selected through multistage random sampling. The study was based on self-report questionnaires including eating attitudes test (EAT-26) and DSM-IV criteria for the presence of eating disorders. To analyze the obtained data we calculated measures of central tendency and dispersion, linear and logistic regression and Fisher\u2019s exact test. According to diagnostic criteria of EAT-26, 492 students (24.2%) were at risk of ED and scored above the recommended cut-off point on EAT-26. Among 1990 students, a total of 51 cases (0.25%) of eating disorder (14 anorexia nervosa, 18 bulimia nervosa, and 19 eating disorder not otherwise specified) were diagnosed. The obtained prevalence of ED in our study was higher than previous studies in Iran. We found high numbers of boys with ED. Overweight adolescents were shown to be more susceptible to strict dieting than normal-weight adolescents. These results suggest that it is necessary to provide screening and treatment services for Iranian adolescents. Further research is needed to develop intervention programs to control eating disorders among Iranian adolescents.",

The aims of this study were to explore perceived changes in eating behaviours in relation to self-reported negative affect during the pandemic and to examine direct and indirect effects of alexithymia on emotional eating. An online questionnaire measured these constructs in the general population of the United Kingdom ( n =\u00a0136). Findings demonstrated that those who reported changes to their eating behaviours during the pandemic also reported greater levels of depression during the same time frame. Mediation analyses revealed that difficulties identifying and describing feelings both predicted emotional eating indirectly via emotion dysregulation. Findings contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms underpinning the relationship between alexithymia and emotional eating and describe changes to eating behaviours during COVID-19. We discuss how these findings should be applied, and recommendations for future research. \u2022 One quarter of participants reported eating more than usual during COVID-19. \u2022 One third of participants reported eating less healthfully than usual. \u2022 Difficulty identifying feelings influences emotional eating via emotion dysregulation. \u2022 Difficulty describing feelings influences emotional eating via emotion dysregulation.

    "abstract": "Binge drinking, frequently referred to clinically as problem or hazardous drinking, is a pattern of excessive alcohol intake characterized by blood alcohol levels \u22650.08\u2009g% within a 2-h period. Here, we show that overexpression of \u03b11 subunits of the GABA A receptor contributes to binge drinking, and further document that this involvement is related to the neuroanatomical localization of \u03b11 receptor subunits. Using a herpes simplex virus amplicon vector to deliver small interference RNA (siRNA), we showed that siRNA specific for the \u03b11 subunit (pHSVsiLA1) caused profound, long-term, and selective reduction of gene expression, receptor density, and binge drinking in high-alcohol drinking rats when delivered into the ventral pallidum (VP). Scrambled siRNA (pHSVsiNC) delivered similarly into the VP failed to alter gene expression, receptor density, or binge drinking. Silencing of the \u03b11 gene in the VP, however, failed to alter binge sucrose or water intake. These results, along with our prior research, provide compelling evidence that the \u03b11-containing GABA A receptor subunits are critical in the regulation of binge-like patterns of excessive drinking. Collectively, these data may be useful in the development of gene-based and novel pharmacological approaches for the treatment of excessive drinking.",

    "abstract": "In Korea, the prevalence of anemia and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) among older infants and young children remains high. To detect IDA early and to reduce its adverse impact, we assessed the characteristics of infants and young children who had IDA or were at risk of developing IDA, or who exhibited characteristics associated with severe anemia. Among the 1,782 IDA-affected children aged 6 months to 18 years who visited the hospital, we retrospectively analyzed the medical records and laboratory data of 1,330 IDA-affected children aged 6\u201323 months who were diagnosed between 1996 and 2013. We excluded patients with a C-reactive protein level \u22655 mg/dL. IDA was predominant in boys (2.14:1) during infancy and early childhood. The peak IDA incidence was noted among infants aged 9\u201312 months. Only 7% patients exhibited symptoms of IDA, while 23.6% patients with severe IDA demonstrated classic symptoms/signs of IDA. Low birth weight (LBW) infants with IDA demonstrated low adherence to iron supplementation. In a multivariate analysis, prolonged breastfeeding without iron fortification (odds ratio [OR] 5.70), and a LBW (OR 6.49) were identified as risk factors of severe anemia. LBW infants need more attention in order to increase their adherence to iron supplementation. For the early detection of IDA, nutritional status of all infants, and iron batteries of high-risk infants (LBW infants, infants with prolonged breastfeeding, picky eaters, and/or infants with the presence of IDA symptoms) should be evaluated at their health screening visits.",

    "abstract": "The effects of three different feeding systems on beef cattle production performance, rumen fermentation, and rumen digesta particle structure were investigated by using 18 Limousin (steers) with a similar body weight (575\u00b110 kg) in a 80-d experiment. The animals were equally and randomly divided into three treatment groups, namely, total mixed ration group (cattle fed TMR), SI1 group (cattle fed concentrate firstly then roughage), and SI2 group (cattle fed roughage firstly then concentrate). The results showed that the average daily gain was significantly higher in cattle receiving TMR than in those receiving SI1 and SI2 (p<0.05). Consumption per kg weight gain of concentrate, silage, and combined net energy (NEmf) were significantly decreased when cattle received TMR, unlike when they received SI1 and SI2 (p<0.05), indicating that the feed efficiency of TMR was the highest. Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was significantly decreased when cattle received TMR compared with that in cattle receiving SI1 (p<0.05), whereas there was no difference compared with that in cattle receiving SI2. Ammonia nitrogen concentration was significantly lower in cattle receiving TMR than in those receiving SI1 and SI2 (p<0.05). The rumen area of cattle that received TMR was significantly larger than that of cattle receiving SI1 (p<0.05), but there was no difference compared with that of cattle receiving SI2. Although there was no significant difference among the three feeding systems in rumen digesta particle distribution, the TMR group trended to have fewer large- and medium-sized particles and more small-sized particles than those in the SI1 and SI2 groups. In conclusion, cattle with dietary TMR showed increased weight gain and ruminal development and decreased BUN. This indicated that TMR feeding was more conducive toward improving the production performance and rumen fermentation of beef cattle.",

However, mothers should also be aware of the importance of breastfeeding for promoting adequate oral development. This study evaluated the association between breastfeeding and non-nutritive sucking patterns and the prevalence of anterior open bite in primary dentition. Infant feeding and non-nutritive sucking were investigated in a 3-6 year-old sample of 1,377 children, from S\u00e3o Paulo city, Brazil. Children were grouped according to breastfeeding duration: G1 \u2013 non-breastfed, G2 \u2013 shorter than 6 months, G3 \u2013 interruption between 6 and 12 months, and G4 \u2013 longer than 12 months. Three calibrated dentists performed clinical examinations and classified overbite into 3 categories: normal, anterior open bite and deep bite. Chi-square tests (p<0.05) with odds ratio (OR) calculation were used for intergroup comparisons. The impact of breastfeeding and non-nutritive sucking on the prevalence of anterior open bite was analyzed using binary logistic regression. The prevalence estimates of anterior open bite were: 31.9% (G1), 26.1% (G2), 22.1% (G3), and 6.2% (G4). G1 would have significantly more chances of having anterior open bite compared with G4; in the total sample (OR=7.1) and in the subgroup without history of non-nutritive sucking (OR=9.3). Prolonging breastfeeding for 12 months was associated with a 3.7 times lower chance of having anterior open bite. In each year of persistence with non-nutritive sucking habits, the chance of developing this malocclusion increased in 2.38 times. Breastfeeding and non-nutritive sucking durations demonstrated opposite effects on the prediction of anterior open bite. Non-breastfed children presented significantly greater chances of having anterior open bite compared with those who were breastfed for periods longer than 12 months, demonstrating the beneficial influence of breastfeeding on dental occlusion.",

The study was conducted at Mother and Child Hospital, Buraidah from January to December 2011. The multinomial logistic regression (MRA) on age, education, occupation, parity and mode of delivery was statistically significant (\u03c7 2 (60) = 487.656, p < .001). Individuals who were between 25 and 30, had education level primary or below, para2 -4 were more likely to limit household activities. Women in the age group of 25-30 were 41 times more likely to have no exercise. Women with parity 2-4 were 24 times more likely to abstain from sex during puerperium as compared to Para 5 and above. Individuals who had a normal vaginal birth were approximately 9 times less likely to be in the kofalaya\u2019s group. Individuals below college level education were more likely to believe that breast feeding in front of others may steal mother\u2019s milk. Women below 25 years of age and women with vaginal delivery were more likely to avoid colostrums feeding. Health Education programs are needed to encourage women to increase physical activity during puerperium and encourage breast feeding. Focus groups for improving physical activity should include age group 25-30 and women with primary and below level education. Women with cesarean delivery should be counseled against kofalayas and women with vaginal delivery should be encouraged for colostrums feeding.",

Face-to-face, semistructured interviews analysed with purposive sampling and thematic analysis. A regional hospital in North Queensland with a high prevalence of diabetes in pregnancy. Six women with a previous pregnancy complicated by diabetes who were advised to collect and store colostrum in pregnancy. Six themes were identified: wariness of medicalisation (adjusting to an \u2018abnormal\u2019 pregnancy, seeking continuity of care, determination to reduce formula, fear of invasive intervention); underlying altruism (providing the best for baby, preparing for complications, eager for milk donation); internal pressure to succeed (coping with confronting information, disheartened by failures, constant fear of insufficient supply, overwhelming guilt, concern for future breastfeeding success); self-management and ownership (adapting to awkwardness, developing strategies for success, actively seeking education, gaining confidence to request help, accepting personal limitations); frustrated by waste (encroaching on time, squandering a precious resource, ambiguous about necessity) and building fortitude for motherhood (physically preparing for breast feeding, symbolic of the imminent infant, establishing early relationships with supports, approaching challenges with realistic optimism). Women with diabetes in pregnancy experience guilt and stress about the added risk of hypoglycaemia to their babies and strive to provide the best for their babies by collecting and storing colostrum, even if this leads to distress to themselves. It is crucial that these women be provided accurate, realistic advice about the benefits and disadvantages of collecting colostrum in the antenatal period.",

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have been widely produced, many of them persist in the environment, and have been associated with various health effects. Previous studies have identified inverse associations between perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), and breastfeeding duration, but have been limited in investigation of other PFASs. We measured the associations between plasma concentrations of nine different PFASs and cessation of breastfeeding before 3 and 6 complete months using women from the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). The study population includes 1716 primarily nulliparous women from two previous studies of MoBa participants, enrolled from 2003 to 2007. The association was measured using Cox proportional hazards model. Mixtures analyses were performed using Elastic net regularization to identify interactive effects and control for copollutant confounding. Concentrations of PFASs in this population were lower than concentrations in the previous studies on this topic. We found associations between increasing concentrations of perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA), and decreased breastfeeding cessation (increased duration). The strongest associations were seen between PFDA and PFUnDA and cessation before 3 months: (both hazard ratios = 0.73; 95% confidence intervals = 0.62, 0.86). In our population, the other PFASs appeared to be unassociated with breastfeeding cessation. The mixtures analyses identified meaningful interactions between PFUnDA:PFDA, perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHXS):PFOA, and PFOA:PFOS. The identification of associations between previously unexamined PFASs concentrations and increased breastfeeding duration is novel and may be explained by differences in transplacental transfer rates.",

It has devastating effects on any population as it increases morbidity children and reduces the quality of life of all affected. The study was done with the objective to assess the undernutrition and morbidity profile in children who have completed exclusive breastfeeding. This was a descriptive cross-sectional study, which was carried out among children aged 6\u201312 completed months attending a tertiary level hospital in Bangladesh. A total of 251 children were selected through convenient sampling from January to December 2015. Nutritional assessment was done in terms of underweight, stunting, and wasting. One hundred and forty-three (57.0%) were boys while 108 (43.0%) were girls. The prevalence of undernutrition (Z-score \u2264\u22122) was observed in 11.2%, 16.3%, and 12.0% based on stunting, underweight, and wasting. Among 251 children, 16.7% were not suffering any diseases, whereas majorities (69.7%) were suffering from single disease and 13.5% were suffering from multiple diseases. Cough and fever (55.0%), pneumonia (18.3%), measles (9.9%), and diarrhea (8.3%) were the most common cause of infectious morbidity observed in children. The prevalence of undernutrition was high in the study population, and it continues to be a public health burden because of its major effect on morbidity and impairment of intellectual and physical development in long-term. Increasing the practice of exclusive breastfeeding, the introduction of timely complementary feeding, and standard case management of morbidities would be beneficial to combat the problem of undernutrition.",

    "abstract": "Breastfeeding suppresses postpartum fecundity (the capacity for reproduction). This mechanism is critically important to control fertility (actual reproduction) when contraception is uncommon. Whether dependence of the contraceptive effect of breastfeeding on environmental conditions is strong enough to have a significant effect on fertility remains unclear. Analyzing 2.7 million births in 84 low- and middle-income countries over the past four decades, we find a dramatic weakening of the breastfeeding\u2013postpartum amenorrhea relationship that correlates with improved living standards. These results suggest that, in the absence of contraception, the effect of breastfeeding on fertility depends on the level of socioeconomic development. The contraceptive effect of breastfeeding remains essential to controlling fertility in many developing regions of the world. The extent to which this negative effect of breastfeeding on ovarian activity is sensitive to ecological conditions, notably maternal energetic status, has remained controversial. We assess the relationship between breastfeeding duration and postpartum amenorrhea (the absence of menstruation following a birth) in 17 World Fertility Surveys and 284 Demographic Health Surveys conducted between 1975 and 2019 in 84 low- and middle-income countries. We then analyze the resumption of menses in women during unsupplemented lactation. We find that a sharp weakening of the breastfeeding\u2013postpartum amenorrhea relationship has globally occurred over the time period analyzed. The slope of the breastfeeding\u2013postpartum amenorrhea relationship is negatively associated with development: higher values of the Human Development Index, urbanization, access to electricity, easier access to water, and education are predictive of a weaker association between breastfeeding and postpartum amenorrhea. Low parity also predicts shorter postpartum amenorrhea. The association between exclusive breastfeeding and maintenance of amenorrhea in the early postpartum period is also found in rapid decline in Asia and in moderate decline in sub-Saharan Africa. These findings indicate that the effect of breastfeeding on ovarian function is partly mediated by external factors that likely include negative maternal energy balance and support the notion that prolonged breastfeeding significantly helps control fertility only under harsh environmental conditions.",

However, research examining factors associated with exclusive breast milk feeding at discharge among preterm neonates in Ethiopia is limited. The study aimed to assess the prevalence of exclusive breast milk feeding at discharge and associated factors among preterm neonates at the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in public hospitals, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. This facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted from February to March 2017 among preterm infants discharged from the NICU of public hospitals. Data were collected using pretested structured questionnaires. Purposive sampling technique was used. Factors associated with exclusive breast milk-fed infants at discharge among preterm neonates were determined using bivariate and multivariate logistic regression models. Statistically significant associations were declared at P<0.05. The study assessed 263 mother-preterm dyads. The findings from this study revealed that 71.9% of exclusive breast milk-fed infants at discharge at NICU of the selected Public hospitals in Addis Ababa. Factors associated with exclusive breast milk-fed infants at discharge included duration of hospital stay for 7\u201314 days (AOR 0.19, 95% CI 0.049\u20130.808) and more than 14 days (AOR 0.20, 95% CI 0.046,0.891), Initiation of breast milk expression later than 48 hrs postpartum (AOR 0.10, 95% CI 0.032\u20130.365) and receiving hospital support (AOR 39.00, 95% CI 11.676\u2013130.290). In this study, nearly \u00be of the NICU premature population exclusively breast milk fed at discharge, which designates to establish exclusive breastfeeding in the majority of preterm infants in this cohort. Thus, support for exclusive breast milk fed should be at the forefront of maternity practice in hospital and mothers of preterm infants to be guided to initiation of early breast milk expression as soon after delivery as possible and frequent expression thereafter.",

In 2007, 909 Hong Kong students aged 12 to 18\u00a0years (55.3% boys) completed a questionnaire including demographic items, RRS, Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26), and Motivation for Eating Scale (MFES)-physical. Moreover, subjects\u2019 height and weight were measured. To examine the factor structure of RRS, the whole sample was randomly split into two groups (sample 1: N =454 and sample 2: N =455) for exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), respectively. Convergent and discriminant validity of RRS were investigated by correlating the RRS with EAT-26 and MFES-physical. Multigroup CFA was conducted to test the three-factor model of RRS in different sex, age, and weight status subgroups. Results of EFA for sample 1 revealed three strongly correlated factors for the RRS construct, and were supported by the CFA results in sample 2. Multigroup CFA further suggested that the three-factor model of RRS was stable across sex, age, and weight status subgroups. A new three-factor model is proposed for Hong Kong adolescents in this study. In general, RRS is a reliable and valid measure of restrained eating for adolescents, regardless of sex, age, and weight status.",

Vertical scar mammaplasty with superior pedicle is expected to be a breast reduction procedure that can keep maintain the function of breastfeeding. This is the first recorded report of breastfeeding after vertical scar reduction mammaplasty with superior pedicle in Indonesia. A 23 years old woman presented to the outpatient clinic with enlargement of both breast for 3 years. Physical examination showed bilateral breast enlargement. No tenderness, nodules, nor axillary lymph node enlargement were found. The patient was managed with vertical scar mammaplasty with superior pedicle. The patient was followed up with complication of skin excess and scarring on the bilateral submammary folds. We performed excision and resection procedures to eliminate the skin excess and scars without further complications. The patient was married and gave birth to her first and second child after two and five years following mammaplasty. The patient was able to provide exclusive breastfeeding for both of her children. Vertical scar mammaplasty with superior pedicle surgery is a surgical technique that combines a superior pedicle for the areola and performs a central-inferior quadrant resection for breast reduction. It only takes the tissue and glands that are located in the lower quadrant and still maintains the surrounding tissue and glands. This technique also maintains the integrity of nipple-areola complex (NAC) which also important in the lactation process Vertical scar mammaplasty with superior pedicle can be one of the superior techniques in breast reduction which can maintain the breastfeeding function thereby increasing patient satisfaction. \u2022 Breastfeeding after Vertical Scar Reduction Mammaplasty with Superior Pedicle: \u2022 This procedure only takes the tissue and glands that are located in the lower quadrant. \u2022 By preserving the superior pedicle it can maintains the integrity of nipple-areola complex (NAC). \u2022 Keep the breastfeeding function thereby increasing patient satisfaction.

    "abstract": "Objective : Chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease and cancer can result from a number of diet-related environmental and behavioral factors. Screening for poor diet is helpful in developing interventions to prevent chronic disease, but measuring dietary behavior can be costly and time-consuming. The purpose of this study was to test the ability of a self-rated, single-item measure for evaluating diet quality among individuals and populations. Methods : A 24-h dietary recall and single-item self-rated diet quality measure were collected for 485 adults. From dietary recalls, Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI) scores were computed and compared with self-rated diet quality. Data were collected in 2013 among adult (18\u00a0years and older) New York City residents. Results : The study sample was 57% female, 47% white, 56% college educated, and 45% in the highest income tertile. The mean HEI score was 56.5 out of a possible 100. Women averaged higher HEI scores compared to men (58.1 vs 54.3, p =\u00a0.01). There was a modest yet significant correlation between HEI scores and self-rated diet quality ( \u03c1 =\u00a00.29, p <\u00a0.01). Overall, mean HEI score increased as self-rated diet quality improved (from 48.2 for \u201cpoor\u201d to 63.0 for \u201cexcellent\u201d). Conclusions : The single-item measure of self-rated diet quality may provide a simple method of identifying those with the worst diet quality. Further investigation of this measure's validity is needed with alternative measures of dietary intake and with health outcomes. \u2022 HEI-2010 scores and self-rated diet quality are modestly correlated in our sample. \u2022 Self-rated diet quality may help identify those with poor dietary intake. \u2022 This single-item measure should be further validated against other data sources.

Cases ( n =\u2009850) were individuals with a BED diagnosis in the Swedish eating disorders quality registers. Ten community controls were matched to each case on sex, and year, month, and county of birth. Associations of BED status with neurologic, immune, respiratory, gastrointestinal, skin, musculoskeletal, genitourinary, circulatory, and endocrine system diseases were evaluated using conditional logistic regression models. We further examined these associations by adjusting for lifetime psychiatric comorbidity. Amongst individuals with BED, we explored whether comorbid obesity was associated with risk of somatic disorders. BED was associated with most classes of diseases evaluated; strongest associations were with diabetes [odds ratio (95% confidence interval)\u2009=\u20095.7 (3.8; 8.7)] and circulatory systems [1.9 (1.3; 2.7)], likely indexing components of metabolic syndrome. Amongst individuals with BED, those with comorbid obesity were more likely to have a lifetime history of respiratory [1.5 (1.1; 2.1)] and gastrointestinal [2.6 (1.7; 4.1)] diseases than those without comorbid obesity. Increased risk of some somatic disease classes in individuals with BED was not simply due to obesity or other lifetime psychiatric comorbidity. The association of BED with many somatic illnesses highlights the morbidity experienced by individuals with BED. Clinicians treating patients with BED should be vigilant for medical comorbidities. Nonpsychiatric providers may be the first clinical contact for those with BED underscoring the importance of screening in primary care. \u00a9 2016 The Authors International Journal of Eating Disorders Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In total, 120 female patients were enrolled in the study and divided into two groups according to the body mass index. Detailed history, anthropometric measurements, urine and blood samples were evaluated for each patient. Two groups significantly differed in weight, BMI, and waist circumference, and were 94.2 \u00b1 14.9 kg, 33.4 \u00b1 5.23 kg/m2 and 99.2 \u00b1 12.6 cm for the study group and 56.0 \u00b1 5.2 kg, 20.0 \u00b1 1.8 kg/m2 and 60.1 \u00b1 10.4 cm for the control group, respectively, sleep disruptions were detected in 48 patients from study group, with mean score 6.76 \u00b1 3.6, and only 10 patients were detected in the control group, with mean score 4.42 \u00b1 1.68. Eating disturbances were revealed in 66 patients from the study group and 21 patients from the control group. Melatonin levels were 17% higher in the study group, compared to control group. Higher melatonin levels in patients with obesity and concomitant behavioural impairments may be due to its protective effect to fight free radicals and to induce vasodilatation.

    "abstract": "This paper reflects the results of a short experiment conducted in parallel with a larger trial which aimed to test the assumption that \u2018consumption of feed by broiler chickens during periods of darkness is largely negligible\u2019. To that effect, on d 31, feeders of birds raised under intermittent lighting (IL), i.e. 1 h of light [1L]:3 h of dark (3D):1L:3D:1L:3D:1L:3D:2L:6D, were weighed at the onset and at the end of each period of darkness (or scotoperiod). Moreover, in order to compare the feeding behavior of IL birds with that of broilers raised under continuous lighting (CL, i.e. 18L:6D), their feeders were weighed in parallel and at the same time points. On d 31, feed intake of IL birds during scotoperiods represented 45% of their 24\u00a0h feed intake. Both CL and IL birds presented anticipatory feed intake prior to the long nocturnal period of darkness (6D), as well as higher feed intake right at the onset of lighting at 06:00. Feed intake of CL birds during the 6D nocturnal scotoperiod was negligible at around 2% of their total feed intake. Intermittent lighting birds exhibited excitement at the start of each hour-length scotoperiod and, within that time, ingested around 2.5 times the amount of feed ingested by CL birds. Although short, this study revealed several interesting observations which might be worth further exploring in a larger, lengthier, behavior-focused experiment. Amongst other factors, it might be interesting to understand whether the high feed intake observed during scotoperiods for IL birds in reflective of the whole flock or rather a coping mechanism developed mainly by hierarchically lower-ranking birds to achieve their daily feed intakes requirements.",

This study aimed to test the hypothesis that risky sexual behaviors among adolescents are associated with legal and illegal drug use. A national cross-sectional survey of 17,371 high-school students was conducted in 2010. Students were selected from 789 public and private schools in each of the 27 Brazilian state capitals by a multistage probabilistic sampling method and answered a self-report questionnaire. Weighted data were analyzed through basic contingency tables and logistic regressions testing for differences in condom use among adolescents who were sexually active during the past month. Approximately one third of the high school students had engaged in sexual intercourse in the month prior to the survey, and nearly half of these respondents had not used a condom. While overall sexual intercourse was more prevalent among boys, unsafe sexual intercourse was more prevalent among girls. Furthermore, a lower socioeconomic status was directly associated with non-condom use, while binge drinking and illegal drug use were independently associated with unsafe sexual intercourse. Adolescent alcohol and drug use were associated with unsafe sexual practices. School prevention programs must include drug use and sexuality topics simultaneously because both risk-taking behaviors occur simultaneously.",

    "abstract": "Background: Cancer-related cachexia and anorexia syndrome (CACS) is a common phenomenon in cancer patients. Cannabis has been suggested to stimulate appetite but research on this issue has yielded mixed results. The current study aimed to evaluate the effect of dosage-controlled cannabis capsules on CACS in advanced cancer patients. Methods: The cannabis capsules used in this study contained two fractions of oil-based compounds. The planned treatment was 2 \u00d7 10 mg per 24 hours for six months of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) 9.5 mg and cannabidiol (CBD) 0.5 mg. If patients suffered from side effects, dosage was reduced to 5 mg \u00d7 2 per day (THC 4.75 mg, CBD 0.25 mg). Participants were weighed on every physician visit. The primary objective of the study was a weight gain of \u226510% from baseline. Results: Of 24 patients who signed the consent form, 17 started the cannabis capsules treatment, but only 11 received the capsules for more than two weeks. Three of six patients who completed the study period met the primary end-point. The remaining three patients had stable weights. In quality of life quaternaries, patients reported less appetite loss after the cannabis treatment ( p =0.05). Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) levels decreased after the cannabis treatment but without statistical significance. According to patients\u2019 self-reports, improvement in appetite and mood as well as a reduction in pain and fatigue was demonstrated. Conclusions: Despite various limitations, this preliminary study demonstrated a weight increase of \u226510% in 3/17 (17.6%) patients with doses of 5mgx1 or 5mgx2 capsules daily, without significant side effects. The results justify a larger study with dosage-controlled cannabis capsules in CACS.",

The role of social support (SS) as a protective factor against ED among IPV-exposed women is not firmly established. The objective of this study is to determine the distribution of risk of EDs among women exposed to IPV and to examine the impact of SS on risk of ED among IPV-exposed women. Women (aged 18\u201364 years) exposed to IPV during their lifetimes (defined by the Humiliation\u2013Afraid\u2013Rape\u2013Kick instrument) were recruited from primary care and domestic violence service agencies and surveyed on demographics, mood/anxiety disorders, psychosocial/community factors, and strategies used in response to IPV. The Eating Disorder Screen for Primary Care assessed the risk of ED. A modified Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey assessed overall functional support (scale range: 0\u201332; categorized into quartiles). Ordinal logistic regression examined the risk of ED based on SS, controlling for prespecified demographics (age, race/ethnicity, marital status, near-poverty level), and health-related factors significant in bivariate analyses (risky alcohol use). Among 302 women with lifetime IPV, 41 (14%) were at high risk, 127 (42%) were at moderate risk, and 134 (44%) were at low risk of an ED. In bivariate analyses, high risk of an ED was significantly more frequent among women with a low SS score (<19, 24%) versus a high SS score (\u226530, 12%) ( P =0.03). High risk of an ED was significantly associated with risky alcohol use (18%) versus non-risky alcohol use (13%; P =0.008). In multivariable analysis, a 5-unit increase in overall SS was significantly associated with decreased odds of ED risk ( P =0.007). Among IPV-exposed women, low SS is associated with an increased risk of ED. SS may protect against ED by reducing anxiety and promoting positive actions, but further study is needed to confirm this.",

We hypothesized that ED patients would show the worst body image quality of life. We also hypothesized that body image quality of life would have a stronger negative association with specific ED-related variables than with other psychological and psychopathological variables, mainly among ED patients. On the basis of previous studies, the influence of gender on the results was explored, too. The final sample comprised 70 ED patients (mean age 22.65 \u00b1 7.76 years; 59 women and 11 men); 106 were patients with other psychiatric disorders (mean age 28.20 \u00b1 6.52; 67 women and 39 men), and 135 were university students (mean age 21.57 \u00b1 2.58; 81 women and 54 men), with no psychiatric history. After having obtained informed consent, the following questionnaires were administered: Body Image Quality of Life Inventory-Spanish version (BIQLI-SP), Eating Disorders Inventory-2 (EDI-2), Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ), Self-Esteem Scale (SES), and Symptom Checklist-90-Revised (SCL-90-R). The ED patients\u2019 ratings on the BIQLI-SP were the lowest and negatively scored (BIQLI-SP means: +20.18, +5.14, and \u22126.18, in the student group, the non-ED patient group, and the ED group, respectively). The effect of body image on quality of life was more negative in the ED group in all items of the BIQLI-SP. Body image quality of life was negatively associated with specific ED-related variables, more than with other psychological and psychopathological variables, but not especially among ED patients. Body image quality of life was affected not only by specific pathologies related to body image disturbances, but also by other psychopathological syndromes. Nevertheless, the greatest effect was related to ED, and seemed to be more negative among men. This finding is the opposite of that found in other groups studied previously.",

    "abstract": "Social media has been associated with body dissatisfaction and eating disorder symptoms among young women and adolescent girls. However, despite notable evidence of susceptibility to body image pressures, it remains unknown whether these associations generalize to sexual minority men. A nationwide sample of 2,733 sexual minority men completed an online survey advertised to Australian and New Zealand users of a popular dating app. Participants answered questions about how frequently they used 11 different social media platforms in addition to questions about their dating app use, body image, eating disorder symptoms, and anabolic steroids. Facebook, Youtube, Instagram, and Snapchat were the most frequently used social media platforms. A pattern of small-sized and positive associations emerged between social media use and body dissatisfaction, eating disorder symptoms, and thoughts about using anabolic steroids. Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat evidenced the strongest associations. The associations of social media use with both muscularity dissatisfaction and eating disorder symptoms were stronger for image-centric social media platforms (e.g., Instagram) than nonimage-centric platforms (e.g., Wordpress); no differences were observed for body fat dissatisfaction, height dissatisfaction, or thoughts about using anabolic steroids. Previously documented associations of social media use with body dissatisfaction and related variables among women and girls appear to generalize to sexual minority men. Social media platforms that more centrally involve imagery may be of greater concern than nonimage-centric platforms. Additional research with sexual minority men is needed to elucidate the distinctions between adaptive and maladaptive social media use in the context of body dissatisfaction, eating disorders, and anabolic steroid use.",

We discuss the atypical characteristics of her symptom profile, in particular the absence of preoccupations concerning her appearance and the psycho-pathological impact of the secrecy surrounding her adoption. In this particular case, bulimia triggered a search for filiation and identity that could have later enabled her to restore harmonious family ties and to gain autonomy. We also examine the case in the context of adoption in China.

The energy input to the ionosphere due to Joule heating increases more rapidly with geomagnetic activity than that due to precipitating particles. The energy flux varies more smoothly with time than Joule heating, which is impulsive in nature on time scales from minutes to tens of minutes. These impulsive events correlate well with recoveries in the Sym\u2010H index, with the maximum correlation when compared to Sym\u2010H recoveries 70\u00a0min later. Because of prior studies that have associated transient recoveries of Sym\u2010H with substorm expansions, the delay found here suggests that dissipation of energy in the ionosphere occurs during the substorm growth phase prior to the release of magnetic energy caused by diversion of tail currents.  We calculate hemispherically integrated precipitating particle energy fluxes and Joule heating from global maps of field\u2010aligned currents Energy input from Joule heating and precipitating particles correlates well with increases in the Sym\u2010H index occurring about 1\u00a0h later Joule heating in the ionosphere during substorm growth phase is approximately equal to magnetic energy released during substorm expansion  We calculate hemispherically integrated precipitating particle energy fluxes and Joule heating from global maps of field\u2010aligned currents Energy input from Joule heating and precipitating particles correlates well with increases in the Sym\u2010H index occurring about 1\u00a0h later Joule heating in the ionosphere during substorm growth phase is approximately equal to magnetic energy released during substorm expansion",

The categorical data were analyzed statistically using the Chi-square test and odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval. Continuous variables were analyzed using an independent t -test. All the analysis was done using SPSS, version 17. The age group of the cases was 25-78 years, while that of the controls was 24-79 years. The proportions of cases (56.3%) and controls (63.3%) living in rural areas were more than those living in urban areas. A significant association of breast cancer cases was found with caste, age at marriage, age at the first pregnancy, number of live births, and lifetime duration of breastfeeding. Breastfeeding has a significant role in reducing breast cancer, and so information, education, and communication activities for the promotion of breastfeeding and creating awareness about this fatal disease are the need of the hour.",

At each aging time, three muscles: longissmus thoracis (LT), glutaeusmedus (GM) and semimembranosus (SM) were taken from the corresponding quarters and cuts, and used for the flavor compounds and sensory analyses. Results showed that both aging methods significantly increased the concentrations of flavor compounds and total amount of all classes of the flavor compounds as the aging time increased (p<0.05). In the dry-aging method, the GM and SM muscles presented significantly higher total amounts of pyrazines and sulfur-containing compounds compared to the LT muscle (p<0.05). Both the aging methods improved the eating quality attributes, indicating by increased scores of sensorial attributes with increased aging time for all the muscles studied (p<0.05). However, compared to the wet-aging, the dry-aging method resulted in significantly higher scores of tenderness and flavor for the GM and SM muscles after 40 to 60 d. Thus, postmortem aging, especially the dry-aging method could be used to improve eating quality attributes (tenderness and flavor) of low fat beef muscles such as GM and SM.",

    "abstract": "Children with cleft lip and/or palate frequently experience feeding difficulties that may place them at risk of malnutrition. Parents' negative response to these problems is associated with development of problematic behaviors in the child. This study aimed to investigate feeding behavior in children with cleft lip and/or palate and parental responses to these problems. A total of 120 parents of children (aged 6 months to 6 years) with cleft lip and/or palate were recruited from the Cleft Lip and Palate Clinic in Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Isfahan, Iran, who gave consent and completed a two-part questionnaire through interviews. Part A of the questionnaire consisted of 25 items that evaluate children's feeding behavior during mealtimes and part B consists of 18 items that assess parental response (strategies, feelings, and anxiety) to these problems. Independent t -test showed a significant difference in the mean score of feeding behavior in mothers ( P = 0.020) and parental responses in fathers ( P = 0.030). The Pearson correlation coefficient showed an inverse correlation between behavioral feeding score and children's interval ( P = 0.008, r = \u22120.381) and direct correlation between parental response and feeding behavioral difficulties ( P = 0.003, r = 0.428). With regards to the results representing appropriate feeding behaviors in children with cleft lip and/or palate, it is suggested that feeding be avioral assessment is an essential nursing and nonmedical intervention for all children.",

    "abstract": "Approximately 40% of women who smoke tobacco quit smoking during pregnancy, yet up to 85% relapse after delivery. Those who resume smoking often do so by 2 to 8 weeks postpartum. Smoking mothers are more than twice as likely to quit breastfeeding by 10 weeks postpartum. The hospitalization of a newborn, while stressful, is an opportunity to emphasize the importance of a smoke-free environment for babies. Supporting maternal-infant bonding may reduce maternal stress and motivate mothers to remain smoke free and continue breastfeeding. The objective of this study was to reduce postpartum smoking relapse and prolong breastfeeding duration during the first 8 weeks postpartum in mothers who quit smoking just before or during pregnancy and have newborns admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU). This study was an Institutional Review Board-approved prospective randomized clinical trial. After informed consent, mothers of newborns admitted to the NICU were randomized to a control or intervention group. Both groups received weekly encouragement to remain smoke free and routine breastfeeding support. Mothers in the intervention group were also given enhanced support for maternal-infant bonding including information about newborn behaviors, and were encouraged to frequently hold their babies skin-to-skin. More mothers were smoke free (81 vs 46%, P <0.001) and breastfeeding (86 vs 21%, P <0.001) in the intervention than in the control group at 8 weeks postpartum. Interventions to support mother\u2013infant bonding during a newborn's hospitalization in the NICU are associated with reduced rates of smoking relapse and prolonged duration of breastfeeding during the first 8 weeks postpartum.",

    "abstract": "In the field of illness prevention, it is becoming increasingly important that effective treatments be broadly disseminated and easily accessible to large populations located over wide geographical areas. The internet offers many opportunities to improve illness prevention and has become an important tool for both providers and users. An increasing number of users are looking for help on web-pages, in forums and chat rooms, to access information and exchange experiences with other users or counselors. Appetite for Life is an Internet-based program for the prevention of eating disorders (ED) in college students. It provides individualized support to students at-risk of developing an ED. Depending on initial screening results, specific program modules are recommended to the user, matching their individual needs. The program contains a web-page with psychoeducational information on ED, an anonymous forum to receive and provide peer support, a supportive monitoring and feedback program and a chat platform, which can be used to communicate with professional counselors and other users. If needed, users can be referred to face-to-face counseling. In this paper we report experience in practical use of the program at the Trinity College Dublin. Participants could anonymously register and individually choose the length of participation in the prevention program. Two months after registration and at the time of deregistration, participants were asked to evaluate the program. Data of Nscreened=457 and Nregistered=100 students are presented. Experiences with the program indicate that support can be matched to individual requirements by providing Internet-delivered stepped-care modules that encourage the user to seek support according to their personal preferences and needs.",

Cross-sectional study conducted in Norway from October 2013 to February 2014. Data were collected via an anonymous, electronic questionnaire. Women with migraine, either pregnant or having delivered within the previous 18 months. Women\u2019s perception of teratogenic risk (numeric rating scale 0\u201310) was obtained for 14 different drugs/substances, including medications commonly used in the acute treatment of migraine. Women\u2019s perspectives on migraine drug therapy were assessed by 10 statements from the Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ-Specific) and six pregnancy/breastfeeding-specific statements. Adherence to migraine treatment during pregnancy and breastfeeding period was assessed by maternal self-report. The study population included 401 women with migraine, of which 140 were pregnant and 261 were new mothers. More than 70% of the women reported use of migraine medications during pregnancy. Still, the majority severely overestimated the risk associated with migraine medications and were concerned about using medications to manage their migraine during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Almost 9 out of 10 women had at some point deliberately avoided using migraine medications during their pregnancy. Women reporting use of migraine medications, however, were more positive and overestimated to a lesser extent the risks of using such medications in pregnancy compared with their counterparts. Women with migraine severely overestimated the risk associated with migraine pharmacotherapy in pregnancy. The majority of women were concerned about use of migraine medications during pregnancy and breastfeeding and reported non-adherence to needed treatment. More attention should be focused on women\u2019s beliefs and concerns regarding migraine pharmacotherapy during pregnancy and breastfeeding in order to improve management of disease, reduce unfounded concerns and enhance adherence to needed treatment.",

Male cancer patients ( n =\u2009136) were followed for a mean time of 4.5\u00a0years. Variables were obtained at baseline: cancer stage, albumin, hemoglobin, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin (IL)-6, bioavailable testosterone, appetite questionnaire, and weight change from baseline to 18\u00a0months. Primary statistical tests included Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis and Cox proportional hazard regression (PHREG). Univariate PHREG showed that cancer stage, albumin, hemoglobin, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and weight change were each significantly associated with mortality risk ( P <\u20090.05), but bioavailable testosterone was not. Multivariate PHREG analysis established that weight change and albumin were jointly statistically significant even after adjusting for stage. In this sample of male oncology patients, cancer stage, serum albumin, and weight loss predicted survival. High levels of inflammatory markers and hemoglobin are associated with increased mortality, but do not significantly improve the ability to predict survival above and beyond cancer stage, albumin, and weight loss.

    "abstract": "There are some studies on the association between attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and the risk of eating disorders (ED). Only few have examined the risk of ED among children and adolescents with ADHD. Previous research which included subjects with ADHD with other comorbidities used inadequate controls and did not focus on the type of ADHD or the role of pharmacological treatment. This matched cohort study was conducted in the Child/Adolescents Psychiatry Unit (CAPU), Bahrain. Using the CAPU diagnostic frameworks, 70 subjects with ADHD were recruited and matched with their corresponding age- and sex- healthy controls at 1:2 ratio (70 cases:140 controls). The participants were children or adolescents aged between 8 and 19 years old. A brief interview was used to collect socio-demographic information and anthropometrics. The risk of ED was estimated using the eating attitude test\u00a0\u221226 (EAT-2). Data were analyzed using cohort analysis. A total of 31.43% of the subjects with ADHD were screened using EAT-26 and found to be \u2018at risk\u2019 for ED, compared to 12.14% of the controls (OR 3.31, 95% CI 1.62\u20136.78). The prevalence of ED among female cases with ADHD was slightly higher than males (33.33% and 30.77%, respectively). Body weight or body mass index was a statistically significant explanatory factor for the risk of ED. The present study shows that children and adolescents with ADHD have a three-fold increased risk of ED compared to healthy controls. This research raised the recommendation that children and adolescents with ADHD should be screened for disordered eating patterns.",

Persons with binge eating disorder show increased impulsivity. We investigated cognitive control to food cues using fNIRS. Compared to healthy controls, binge eaters show weaker activation of the prefrontal cortex. After behavioral therapy, binge eaters increase prefrontal cortex activation. Behavioral and cognitive control are vital for healthy eating behavior. Patients with binge eating disorder (BED) suffer under recurrent binge eating episodes accompanied by subjective loss of control that results, among other factors, from increased impulsivity. In the current study, we investigated the frontal network using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) during a food specific go/nogo task to assess response inhibition in 24 patients with BED (BMI range 22.6\u201359.7\u00a0kg/m 2 ) compared to 12 healthy controls (HC) (BMI range 20.9\u201327\u00a0kg/m 2 ). Patients with BED were invited to undergo fNIRS measurements before an impulsivity-focused cognitive behavioral group treatment, directly after this treatment and 3\u00a0months afterwards. As this was a planned subgroup analysis of the randomized controlled IMPULS trial, patients with BED were randomized either to the treatment group (n\u00a0=\u00a014) or to a control group (n\u00a0=\u00a010). The treatment group received 8 weekly sessions of the IMPULS treatment. We found a significant response inhibition effect ( nogo minus go ), in terms of an increased oxygenated hemoglobin response in the bilateral prefrontal cortex in both groups. The greatest response was observed when participants were instructed to go for healthy and withhold their response to unhealthy high caloric food cues. The healthy nogo condition failed to show a significant prefrontal inhibitory response, which was probably related to the task design, as the condition was considered more demanding. BED patients, especially those with higher trait impulsivity, showed a weaker activation of the prefrontal cortex during response inhibition, predominantly in the right hemisphere. Interestingly, three months after the treatment, patients of the treatment group increased their right prefrontal cortex activity during response inhibition. Likewise, increased prefrontal cortex activation correlated with decreased trait impulsivity after treatment. Our results suggest that patients with BED have limited resources to activate the prefrontal cortex when asked to inhibit a reaction onto food-specific stimuli. However, this effect could be partly driven by differences in BMI between the HC and BED group. Cognitive-behavioral therapy targeting impulsive eating behavior may improve prefrontal cortex recruitment during response inhibition.",

    "abstract": "The present study investigated risk factors for iron deficiency (ID) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA) during late infancy, including feeding type and complementary feeding (CF) practice. Healthy term Korean infants (8\u201315 months) were weighed, and questionnaires regarding delivery, feeding, and weaning were completed by their caregivers. We also examined levels of hemoglobin, serum iron/total iron-binding capacity, serum ferritin, and mean corpuscular volume (MCV). Among 619 infants, ID and IDA were present in 174 infants (28.1%) and 87 infants (14.0%), respectively. The 288 infants with exclusively/mostly breastfeeding until late infancy (BFL) were most likely to exhibit ID (53.1%) and IDA (28.1%). The risk of ID was independently associated with BFL (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 47.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 18.3\u2013122.9), male sex (aOR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2\u20132.9), fold weight gain (aOR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.5\u20134.6), and perceived inadequacy of red meat intake (aOR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0\u20132.7). In addition to the risk factors for ID, Cesarean section delivery (aOR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.1\u20133.2) and low parental CF-related knowledge (aOR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.5\u20135.2) were risk factors for IDA. In conclusion, prolonged breastfeeding and perceived inadequacy of red meat intake may be among the important feeding-related risk factors of ID and IDA. Therefore, more meticulous education and monitoring of iron-rich food intake, such as red meat, with iron supplementation or iron status testing during late infancy if necessary, should be considered for breastfed Korean infants, especially for those with additional risk factors for ID or IDA.",

From Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2013\u20132016 data, 2,305 adults aged 20 years and older that ate meals alone were included in this study. Their energy and nutrients intakes, as well as their nutrient adequacy ratio (NAR), mean adequacy ratio (MAR), and index of nutritional quality (INQ) were analyzed. Food group consumption pattern, dietary variety score (DVS), dietary diversity score (DDS) were also analyzed. All data were compared among gender and age groups. Men consumed more energy and nutrients than women, except for vitamin C, and the NARs showed similar gender differences. The INQs of 4 nutrients (calcium, vitamin A, vitamin C, and riboflavin) were lower than 1.0 in men, whereas only the calcium INQ was lower than 1.0 in women. Men had a lower DDS (3.6) than women (3.9) ( P < 0.001) and had more \u2018undesirable\u2019 food group consumption patterns than women ( P < 0.001). The intakes of calcium, vitamin A, and vitamin C were relatively low in the young-aged group (INQs less than 1.0). In the old-aged group, the MAR level was relatively low, and the INQs of calcium, riboflavin, and niacin were below 1.0. The old-aged group consumed more menu items, but their DVS was the lowest. Compared to women, the dietary quality and food diversity among men were poorer. There were poorer quality and diversity patterns in the young-aged group compared to those of the older groups. An overall low intake of nutrients and the low nutrient density of meals were the main dietary problems among the old-aged group who eat alone. Therefore, men, particularly young- and old-aged, need to be prioritized in nutritional policies directed toward those who eat alone.",

Therefore, we aimed to compare two methods of bolus and intermittent feeding on enteral feeding intolerance of patients with sepsis. METHODS This triple-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted on 60 patients with sepsis, who were fed through tubes for at least 3 days. The patients were randomly assigned into bolus feeding, intermittent feeding, and control groups. Enteral feeding intolerance of all patients was recorded in 3 consecutive days by a researcher-made checklist including the data on gastric residual volume, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, and abdominal distension. RESULTS There were no significant differences between the three studied groups in none of the intervention days pertaining to constipation, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal distention, and gastric residual volume ( p > 0.05). Also, no statistically significant difference was found between all variables in the three studied groups during the 3 days ( p > 0.05). CONCLUSION As enteral feeding intolerance of patients with sepsis was similar in both bolus and intermittent feeding methods, it can be concluded that bolus method can still be used as a standard method to decrease the risk of enteral feeding intolerance if it is used properly",

In line with the literature, this study aimed to develop a behavioural and psychological profile based on factors of personality, eating behaviours, emotional functioning, physical well-being, and psychopathology. The sample consisted of 105 community participants who had reduced their bodyweight by at least 10% and had either successfully maintained their weight loss for a minimum 12-month period ( n = 41) or had regained their weight loss within 12 months ( n = 64). Participants completed an online survey comprising demographic items and four empirical measures (Mini Marker Personality Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire , Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire-Revised, and a food screening tool) . Based on significant bivariate correlations results, four factors (fat intake, restrained eating, uncontrolled eating, and emotional eating) were entered into a binary logistic regression. Restrained eating was the only factor that significantly increased the likelihood of predicting successful long-term weight loss. Findings have implications for overweight and obesity future research, which may guide the direction of obesity and overweight treatments.

    "abstract": "Gastroesophageal reflux is a common disorder in pediatrics. Clinicians should be familiar with the proper evaluation and management of this condition. To provide an update on the current understanding, evaluation, and management of gastroesophageal reflux in children. A PubMed search was performed with Clinical Queries using the key term \u2018gastroesophageal reflux\u2019. The search strategy included meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, clinical trials, observational studies, and reviews. The search was restricted to the English literature and the pediatric age group. Regurgitation is the most frequent symptom of gastroesophageal reflux and is present in nearly all cases. Gastroesophageal reflux occurs normally in infants, is often physiological, peaks at 4 months of age, and tends to resolve with time. Gastroesophageal reflux disease occurs when gastric contents reflux into the esophagus or oropharynx and produce troublesome symptom(s) and/or complication(s). A thorough clinical history and a thorough physical examination are usually adequate for diagnosis. When the diagnosis is ambiguous, diagnostic studies may be warranted. A combined esophageal pH monitoring and multichannel intraluminal esophageal electrical impedance device is the gold standard for the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease if the diagnosis is in doubt. In the majority of cases, no treatment is necessary for gastroesophageal reflux apart from reassurance of the benign nature of the condition. Treatment options for gastroesophageal reflux disease are discussed. In most cases, no treatment is necessary for gastroesophageal reflux apart from reassurance because the condition is benign and self-limiting. Thickened feedings, postural therapy, and lifestyle changes should be considered if the regurgitation is frequent and problematic. Pharmacotherapy should be considered in the treatment of more severe gastroesophageal reflux disease for patients who do not respond to conservative measures. Proton pump inhibitors are favored over H 2 -receptor antagonists because of their superior efficacy. Antireflux surgery is indicated for patients with significant gastroesophageal reflux disease who are resistant to medical therapy.",

In the present study, the anti-anorexigenic effect of electroacupuncture (EA) was explored through assessing a change in appetite-associated peptides and c-Fos expression in a rat model of cisplatin-induced anorexia. In order to identify the most effective acupuncture point, 20 male Wistar rats (divided into five groups including the normal saline control, cisplatin only control and three groups according to the acupoints stimulated) were subjected to EA for 10 min at CV12, ST36 or PC6 daily for 4 days. Subsequently, the rats received intraperitoneal injections of cisplatin (6 mg/kg) to induce CIA. Food intake and reduction in body weight gain as the anorexia-associated outcomes were assessed daily for up to 3 days after cisplatin injection, and CV12 was eventually chosen as the most effective acupoint to test the anti-anorexigenic effect of EA. Furthermore, food intake, body weight and the concentrations of appetite-associated peptides, including ghrelin, cholecystokinin (CCK) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), in addition to c-Fos expression, were comparatively assessed between the CV12 EA group (n=6; rats treated with EA at CV12 daily for 4 days) and a control group (n=6; rats without treatment). The results indicated that the CV12 EA group exhibited a better outcome regarding food intake and body weight compared with the controls. Although there was no statistically significant difference observed, the secretion of serum ghrelin and CCK was increased in the CV12 EA group compared with that in the control group. The plasma level of 5-HT after cisplatin injection in the CV12 EA group was lower compared with that in the control, although no statistical significance was reached. Although not statistically significant, the expression of c-Fos protein in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) was reduced in the CV12 EA rats. In addition, the hypothalamic mRNA levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were significantly increased in the CV12 EA group. In the hypothalamus, the expression of neuropeptide Y mRNA slightly increased in the cisplatin + CV12 EA group compared with the cisplatin only control group. In conclusion, the anti-anorexigenic effect of EA on CIA may be associated with an increase in the secretion of ghrelin and CCK and a decrease in the secretion of 5-HT into the serum, a reduction of c-Fos expression in the NTS and an increase in BDNF mRNA expression in the hypothalamus.",

    "abstract": "This study aims to evaluate the role of breastfeeding in the acquisition of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection in Iran and to compare the histopathologic changes occurring in children feeding on breast milk with those in infants feeding on formula. In a case-control study parents of children with and without H. pylori infection who had undergone endoscopic survey and gastric biopsy in the Children's Medical Center, Tehran, were asked about their feeding practices during the first 6 months after birth, the duration of breastfeeding period, the symptoms, and the duration of symptoms and concomitant diseases. A total of 154 children were included in this study. From this sample, 77 children formed the case group and 77 children formed the control group. A significant difference was found between H. pylori infection and feeding with formula ( P =0.045). In case group, a significant difference was found between breastfeeding and age of the infected child ( P =0.034), shorter duration of symptoms ( P =0.016), and finally degree of H. pylori colonization ( P =0.021). It appears that breastfeeding in the first 6 months after birth can decrease the degree of H. pylori colonization, postpone infection until older age, shorten the duration of symptoms, and be concomitant with milder gastritis.",

    "abstract": "In Lake Zone, Tanzania, low contraceptive prevalence, closely spaced births, and child stunting are common. Synergies exist between postpartum family planning (PPFP) and maternal, infant, and young child nutrition (MIYCN), yet health services are often provided in silos. This qualitative formative research study aimed to identify barriers and facilitating factors for optimal nutrition and PPFP practices in Mara and Kagera, Tanzania. Results informed the program design of an integrated nutrition and family planning (FP) implementation approach. The study involved in\u2010depth interviews with mothers of infants under 1\u00a0year ( n =\u00a024), grandmothers ( n =\u00a012), health providers ( n =\u00a06), and traditional birth attendants ( n =\u00a012), and 14 focus group discussions with community health workers, fathers, and community leaders. Findings reveal that breastfeeding initiation was often delayed, and prelacteal feeding was common. Respondents linked insufficient breast milk to inadequate maternal nutrition\u2014in terms of the quality of the diet and small quantities of food consumed by mothers. Breast milk insufficiency was addressed through early introduction of foods and liquids. Mothers believed that breastfeeding prevents pregnancy, regardless of the frequency or duration of breastfeeding, yet were generally not aware of the lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) of FP. Joint decision\u2010making on FP was viewed as important, and women often discussed it with their partner. Future programming should address misconceptions about return to fecundity 1 knowledge gaps and concerns about FP methods including LAM; and perceptions regarding insufficient breast milk and early introduction of foods which are impediments to optimal MIYCN and FP practices.",

    "abstract": "Prosthetic joint infection (PJI) is a devastating complication following total joint arthroplasty. Non-contact induction heating of metal implants is a new and emerging treatment for PJI. However, there may be concerns for potential tissue necrosis. It is thought that segmental induction heating can be used to control the thermal dose and to limit collateral thermal injury to the bone and surrounding tissues. The purpose of this study was to determine the thermal dose, for commonly used metal implants in orthopaedic surgery, at various distances from the heating centre (HC). Commonly used metal orthopaedic implants (hip stem, intramedullary nail, and locking compression plate (LCP)) were heated segmentally using an induction heater. The thermal dose was expressed in cumulative equivalent minutes at 43\u00b0C (CEM43) and measured with a thermal camera at several different distances from the HC. A value of 16 CEM43 was used as the threshold for thermal damage in bone. Despite high thermal doses at the HC (7161 CEM43 to 66 640 CEM43), the thermal dose at various distances from the HC was lower than 16 CEM43 for the hip stem and nail. For the fracture plate without corresponding metal screws, doses higher than 16 CEM43 were measured up to 5 mm from the HC. Segmental induction heating concentrates the thermal dose at the targeted metal implant areas and minimizes collateral thermal injury by using the non-heated metal as a heat sink. Implant type and geometry are important factors to consider, as they influence dissipation of heat and associated collateral thermal injury. Cite this article : B. G. Pijls, I. M. J. G. Sanders, E.

Forty-four obese subjects (BMI= 48\u00b18 kg/m 2 ) were studied before and after ~20% weight loss induced by bariatric surgery (25 Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, 11 laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, and 8 sleeve gastrectomy). We assessed: 1) FA (Yale Food Addiction Scale), 2) food cravings (Food Craving Inventory) and 3) restrictive, emotional and external eating behaviors (Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire). FA was identified in 32% of subjects before surgery. Compared with non-FA subjects, those with FA craved foods more frequently, and had higher scores for emotional and external eating behaviors (all P-values <0.01; all Cohen\u2019s d >0.8). Surgery-induced weight loss resulted in remission of FA in 93% of FA subjects; no new cases of FA developed after surgery. Surgery-induced weight loss decreased food cravings, and emotional and external eating behaviors in both groups (all P-values <0.001; all Cohen\u2019s d\u22650.8). Restrictive eating behavior did not change in non-FA subjects but increased in FA subjects (P<0.01; Cohen\u2019s d>1.1). Bariatric surgery-induced weight loss induces remission of FA and improves several eating behaviors that are associated with FA.",

This was because studies have been inconsistent regarding the effect of parity and breast feeding duration on the risk of osteoporosis. A systematic literature search of relevant studies published by December 26, 2018 was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, RISS, KISS, KMbase, and KoreaMed. Outcome estimates of odds ratio (OR) or standardized mean difference were pooled with fixed or random-effect model. In case of heterogeneity, subgroup analysis was conducted. Seven cross-sectional studies (with 3,813 subjects) were included in the analysis. OR for osteoporosis was 1.43 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09\u20131.88, P = 0.010) in postmenopausal women with higher parity compared to those with less parity. Moreover, OR for osteoporosis was 1.93 (95% CI = 1.28\u20132.93, P = 0.002) in postmenopausal women with longer durations of breast feeding than in those with shorter durations of breast feeding. This study revealed that duration of breast feeding increased the risk of osteoporosis in postmenopausal Korean women.

The BWL group exhibited significantly greater reductions in binge eating behaviour at post\u2010treatment compared with the ACT group. Significant improvements in other outcomes were found with minimal differences between groups. In both groups, decreases in weight\u2010related experiential avoidance were related to improvements in binge eating behaviour.

    "abstract": "Online open book assessment has been a common alternative to a traditional invigilated test or examination during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, its unsupervised nature increases ease of cheating, which is an academic integrity concern. This study's purpose was to evaluate the integrity of two online open book assessments with different formats (1. Tightly time restricted - 50\u00a0min for mid-semester and 2. Take home - any 4\u00a0h within a 24-h window for end of semester) implemented in a radiologic pathology unit of a Bachelor of Science (Medical Radiation Science) course during the pandemic. This was a retrospective study involving a review and analysis of existing information related to the integrity of the two radiologic pathology assessments. Three integrity evaluation approaches were employed. The first approach was to review all the Turnitin plagiarism detection software reports with use of \u2018seven-words-in-a-row\u2019 criterion to identify any potential collusion. The second approach was to search for highly irrelevant assessment answers during marking for detection of other cheating types. Examples of highly irrelevant answers included those not addressing question requirements and stating patients' clinical information not from given patient histories. The third approach was an assessment score statistical analysis through descriptive and inferential statistics to identify any abnormal patterns that might suggest cheating occurred. An abnormal pattern example was high assessment scores. The descriptive statistics used were minimum, maximum, range, first quartile, median, third quartile, interquartile range, mean, standard deviation, fail and full mark rates. T-test was employed to compare mean scores between the two assessments in this year (2020), between the two assessments in the last year (2019), between the two mid-semester assessments in 2019 and 2020, and between this and last years' end of semester assessments. A p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. No cheating evidence was found in all Turnitin reports and assessment answers. The mean scores of the end of semester assessments in 2019 (88.2%) and 2020 (90.9%) were similar (p\u00a0=\u00a00.098). However, the mean score of the online open book mid-semester assessment in 2020 (62.8%) was statistically significantly lower than that of the traditional invigilated mid-semester assessment in 2019 (71.8%) with p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001. This study shows the use of the online open book assessments with tight time restrictions and the take home formats in the radiologic pathology unit did not have any academic integrity issues. Apparently, the strict assessment time limit played an important role in maintaining their integrity.",

To (1) evaluate the prevalence of Triad risk factors and iron supplementation in high school distance runners and (2) pilot a screening tool for Triad risk score. Descriptive epidemiology study. The study population included female high school athletes who participated in cross-country/track. Participants completed a survey including questions regarding dietary habits, menstrual history, and bone stress injury (BSI) history. They then underwent evaluation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, free triiodothyronine (T 3 ), and dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan to measure body fat and BMD through use of age-, sex-, and ethnicity-matched Z scores. Triad scores were calculated. Relationships were analyzed using Spearman correlation coefficient. There were 38 study participants (mean age, 16.9 years). Average body mass index was 19.8 kg/m 2 . Disordered eating or eating disorders were reported in 76.3% of runners; in addition, 23.7% reported delayed menarche, 45.9% had a history of amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea, 42.1% had low BMD ( Z score < \u20131.0), and 15.8% reported prior BSI. Low free T 3 was significantly associated with higher Triad risk scores ( r  S = \u20130.36; P = .028). More than 42% of athletes were supplementing iron. The prevalence of Triad risk factors in high school distance runners was high. Free T 3 was inversely associated with Triad score, which may serve as an indicator of low energy availability.

Patients were taken as their own controls. Quality of life was evaluated using the EORTC QLQ-C30 core questionnaire, and the EORTC H&N35 and OES24 specific questionnaires. The feeding technique tolerance was evaluated using a questionnaire specifically developed for this study. Two evaluations were made, the first a week after hospital discharge ( n = 39) and the second 3 weeks later ( n = 30). Overall, the global health status/quality of life scale score slightly improved; among symptoms, scale scores that significantly improved ( P < 0.05) concerned constipation, coughing, social functioning and body image/sexuality. The physical feeding technique tolerance was acceptable while the technique was psychologically less tolerated with two-thirds of the patients longing to have the tube removed. Onethird of the patients was also uncomfortable about their body image. Home enteral tube feeding was responsible for not visiting family or close relations in 15% of patients, and not going out in public in 23%.

There were no significant differences in serum BPA levels between boys (n=31) and girls (n=29). No significant correlations were found between serum BPA levels and age, body weight, birth weight, and gestational age. Bottle-feeding seems to increase the risk of infant exposure to BPA.

Despite the high comorbidity between binge eating disorder (BED) and obesity, few authors have studied the link between trauma and BED. In this review the association between exposure to adverse life experiences and a risk for the development of obesity and BED in adulthood is explored. Based on a scientific literature review in Medline, PubMed and PsycInfo databases, the results of 70 studies ( N =\u2009306,583 participants) were evaluated including 53 studies on relationship between adverse life experiences and obesity, 7 studies on post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in relation to obesity, and 10 studies on the association between adverse life experiences and BED. In addition, mediating factors between the association of adverse life experiences, obesity and BED were examined. The majority of studies (87%) report that adverse life experiences are a risk factor for developing obesity and BED. More precisely a positive association between traumatic experiences and obesity and PTSD and obesity were found, respectively, in 85% and 86% of studies. Finally, the great majority of studies (90%) between trauma and the development of BED in adulthood strongly support this association. Meanwhile, different factors mediating between the trauma and obesity link were identified. Although research data show a strong association between life adverse experiences and the development of obesity and BED, more research is needed to explain this association.",

    "abstract": "None of the published studies involving cancer cachexia experimental models have included a measure of the severity of the syndrome like the scoring system previously developed for human subjects. The aim of the present investigation was to define and validate a cachexia score usable in both rat and mouse tumor models. In order to achieve this goal, we included in the study one rat model (Yoshida AH\u2010130ascites hepatoma) and two mouse models (Lewis lung carcinoma and Colon26 carcinoma). The Animal cachexia score (ACASCO) includes five components: (a) body and muscle weight loss, (b) inflammation and metabolic disturbances, (c) physical performance, (d) anorexia, and (e) quality of life measured using discomfort symptoms and behavioral tests. Using the ACASCO values, three cut\u2010off values were estimated by applying hierarchical cluster analysis. Four groups were originally described, one exactly below the observed mean, a second exactly over the mean, and two other groups adjusted to every cue (inferior and superior). The three cut\u2010off values were estimated through maximization of the classification function. This was accomplished by using a similarity matrix based on the metric properties of the variables and assuming multinormal distribution. The results show that the four groups were: no cachexia, mild cachexia, moderate cachexia and advanced cachexia. The results obtained allow us to conclude that the score could be very useful as an endpoint in pre\u2010clinical studies involving therapeutic strategies for cancer cachexia. The potential usefulness of ACASCO relates to the primary endpoint in pre\u2010clinical cancer cachexia drug evaluations.",

Relevant clinical and laboratory data of 60 patients with AD admitted to our hospital in Japan for aspiration pneumonia were retrospectively compared between oral feeding and discontinuance groups. The study groups differed in interval since diagnosis of AD, CURB-65 score, pneumonia severity index score, and proportion of patients who died (higher in the discontinuance group) and body mass index (BMI), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, and functional independence measure score (lower in the discontinuance group). According to multivariate logistic regression analysis of all identified independent variables, only CURB-65 and MMSE scores and BMI are significant predictors of discontinuance of oral feeding after aspiration pneumonia in patients with advanced AD. In patients with advanced AD, discontinuance of oral feeding after aspiration pneumonia may be predicted by CURB-65 and MMSE scores and BMI.",

This study was a clinical trial with a control group. Seventy-eight girl infants, 0 - 4 months old that were exclusively breastfed by their mothers, were randomly assigned to the intervention group (received herbal tea containing 7.5 g fenugreek seed powder in addition to 3 g of black tea, three times a day) and the control group (received herbal tea containing 3 g of black tea powder, three times a day). Before and during the four weeks of study, the signs of breast milk sufficiency were evaluated through measurement of growth parameters and use of follow-up forms for measuring the number of wet diapers in one day, frequency of defecation and infant breast-feeding times in a day. Before the intervention there was no significant difference between weight, height, head circumference, the number of wet diapers and frequency of defecation between the two groups (P > 0.05), yet the number of breast feeding times of the control group was more than the Fenugreek group.

Semistructured interviews were conducted with six women with BN and four women with BED following a group-based therapy programme. Transcribed interviews were analysed using a text-condensing analytic approach. The analysis resulted in three main categories, that is, expectations about (1) increased knowledge, (2) symptom changes and (3) therapeutic expertise. The women expected that learning more about nutrition and physical exercise would give them more energy, less fear of food, physical and mental symptoms and a negative body focus. They also expected therapists to be professional and competent, and able to take care of them. The overall high and positive treatment expectation can, to some extent, reflect enthusiasm about a new and innovative approach to treatment. However, the results also reflect generic and highly adequate outcome expectations, which for the purpose of effectiveness should be incorporated into all treatment efforts at least for patients with eating disorders.

    "abstract": "Eating disorders are complex and multifactorial illnesses that affect a broad spectrum of individuals across the life span. Contrary to historic societal beliefs, this disorder is not gender-specific. Lifetime prevalence of eating disorders in males is on the rise and demanding the attention of primary care providers, as well as the general population, in order to negate the potentially life-threatening complications. Current literature has continued to reinforce the notion that eating disorders predominately affect females by excluding males from research, thereby adding to the void in men-centered knowledge and targeted clinical care. To determine what is currently known about eating disorders among males, a scoping review was undertaken, which identified 15 empirical studies that focused on this topic. Using the Garrard matrix to extract and synthesize the findings across these studies, this scoping review provides an overview of the contributing and constituting factors of eating disorders in males by exploring the associated stigmas, risk factors, experiences of men diagnosed with an eating disorder, and differing clinical presentations. The synthesized evidence is utilized to discuss clinical recommendations for primary care providers, inclusive of male-specific treatment plans, as a means to improving care for this poorly understood and emerging men\u2019s health issue.",

    "abstract": "Breastfeeding is integral for the healthy development of infants during the first year of life. The objective of this study was to investigate the feeding practices and their effect on dental health among Saudi children in rural Jazan, the southern region of Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 330 participants from two villages namely Baish and Abu-Areesh of Jazan Province, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Mothers whose children were above 2 years of age agreed for a face-to-face interview to discuss about feeding practices followed for their children. Later, these children underwent a complete dental examination. In this study, it was found that a majority of mothers, 203 (61.15%) of them breastfed their children for less than a year, 105 (31.8%) of them breastfed for 2 to 4 years, and the remaining 22 (6.6%) of them breastfed for more than 4 years. Two hundred and forty-nine (75.15%) moms reported that they added sugar to milk while feeding and 259 (78.4%) mothers reported using sugar with pacifiers. Increased incidence of caries was seen with a statistically significant difference in children who were fed during sleep ( p = 0.038), when the infant's teeth were not brushed after feeding ( p = 0.004), and when sugar was added while feeding ( p = 0.001). Prevalence of dental caries was high in children who were fed during sleep and also in those kids using pacifiers containing sugar. Oral hygiene practices were also inadequate and positively associated with dental caries. These findings are suggestive of developing general and oral health interventions for children and also educating mothers on appropriate feeding practices.

    "abstract": "Severe beeding which requiring massive blood transfusion after emergent beating heart surgery is shown to be 1\u20133%. Therefore, complications and side effects of transfusion can be seen. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of Ankaferd blood clotter (ABC) as a new topical herbal blood clotter to decrease mediastinal bleeding in emergent beating heart CABG patients who medicated with clopidogrel and acetyl salisilic acite (ASA) prior to CABG surgery. 25 CABG patients received a high dose clopidogrel (600 mgr) and 300 mgr ASA have been included into the study (ABC group). 25 patients have also been included into the study for comparison (placebo group, PG). After the administration of protamine sulphate, a 10 ml of ABC solution has been sprayed to the surgical area including mediastinum and epicardial sac. We compared mediastinal drenaige, reoperation due to tamponade, and required blood and blood products in both groups. The mean amount of bleeding after operation was 230 ml in ABC group, and 490 ml in CG (P=0.001). In ICU, bleeding in ABC group and CG was 410ml and 680ml, respectively (P=0.0022). The mean total bleeding from mediastinum was 530 \u00b1 280 mL and 990\u00b1440 mL In ABC and CG group, respectively (P=0.001). The amount of autotransfusion was as follows: 175 mL in ABC group, and 290 mL in CG (P=0.002). No patient needed the surgical revision in ABC group, but four patients (16%) from CG group because of cardiac tamponade. Seventeen patients from CG required blood transfusion due to low hematocrite level postoperatively. In CG, the mean hematocrite level was 17\u00b12,3. Transfusion of fresh frozen plasma and platelets in ABC group and CG were as follows: 0.2 and 0 in ABC group, and 0.3and 0.4 in CG. Our study showed that the local use of 10 mL ABC reduces bleeding significantly. Therefore, transfusion requirements of PRBC, platelets, and total blood units in patients on clopidogrel and ASA undergoing emergent beating heart CABG. To provide cardiac tamponade because of excessive mediastinal bleeding and requirement of blood transfusion after emergent CABG patients who previously administered clopidogrel and ASA, we propose local use of ABC solution as a potent coagulant agent.",

    "abstract": "In this study, co-pyrolysis of single-use face mask (for the protection against COVID-19) and food waste was investigated for the purpose of energy and resource valorization of the waste materials. To this end, disposable face mask (a piece of personal protective equipment) was pyrolyzed to produce fuel-range chemicals. The pyrolytic gas evolved from the pyrolysis of the single-use face mask consisted primarily of non-condensable permanent hydrocarbons such as CH 4 , C 2 H 4 , C 2 H 6 , C 3 H 6 , and C 3 H 8 . An increase in pyrolysis temperature enhanced the non-condensable hydrocarbon yields. The pyrolytic gas had a HHV of >40\u00a0MJ\u00a0kg \u22121 . In addition, hydrocarbons with wider carbon number ranges (e.g., gasoline-, jet fuel-, diesel-, and motor oil-range hydrocarbons) were produced in the pyrolysis of the disposable face mask. The yields of the gasoline-, jet fuel-, and diesel-range hydrocarbons obtained from the single-use mask were highest at 973\u00a0K. The pyrolysis of the single-use face mask yielded 14.7\u00a0wt% gasoline-, 18.4\u00a0wt% jet fuel-, 34.1\u00a0wt% diesel-, and 18.1\u00a0wt% motor oil-range hydrocarbons. No solid char was produced via the pyrolysis of the disposable face mask. The addition of food waste to the pyrolysis feedstock led to the formation of char, but the presence of the single-use face mask did not affect the properties and energy content of the char. More H 2 and less hydrocarbons were produced by co-feeding food waste in the pyrolysis of the disposable face mask. The results of this study can contribute to thermochemical management and utilization of everyday waste as a source of energy. Image 1",

The data of 68 mothers and their daughters were used in statistical analysis (anorexia nervosa restrictive type: 18, anorexia nervosa binge/purge type: 12, bulimia: 14, depression: 24). The mean age in the group of mothers was 43.5 (SD 5.3), daughters: 16.7 (SD 1.4). In the group of mothers, the results of EAT26 test were lower than results of the general population of Polish females or patients\u2019 mothers obtained in a different cultural context. Results from girls with an eating disorder diagnosis considerably exceed the mean result of Polish population studies of teenagers. There were no statistically significant differences between the EAT26 results of mothers of girls with various types of eating disorders and mothers of depressive girls. Sociocultural variables such as education and place of residence of mothers also did not differentiate the studied groups and did not have a significant influence on attitudes towards weight and body shape presented by the studied mothers. The obtained results may suggest that in the studied population, the social background of mothers and disturbances of their own mothers\u2019 attitudes towards weight and body shape were not an important and specific risk factor in the development of their daughters\u2019 eating disorders.",

This is a kind of comparative and prospective study that was carried out in 306 mothers who were registered at seven family health centers. The study sample comprised 68 primiparous mothers who were in the risky age group and 238 primiparous mothers who were not in the risky age group. It was interviewed with the mothers twice when their babies were one and six months old. Personal Information Form, Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy Scale-Short Form (BSES-SF), and LATCH Breastfeeding Assessment Tool were used for data collection. The mothers in the risky age group had a lower breastfeeding rate when their babies were one month old and a higher formula feeding rate when their babies were six months old than the rates observed in case of the mothers in the non-risky age group. Mothers in the non-risky age group breastfed 14.8 times more in the first month and 5.4 times more in the sixth month than those in the risky age group. The mean scores of LATCH and BSES-SF in the first month and the mean scores of BSES-SF in the sixth month of mothers in the non-risky age group were higher than those of the mothers in the risky age group. It was determined that primiparous mothers in the non-risky age group exhibited more positive behaviors in terms of breastfeeding. Close monitoring of breastfeeding behaviors of mothers in the risky age group could be recommended.",

    "abstract": "Available evidence shows that only a small proportion of Nigerian women access postnatal care and practice exclusive breastfeeding. Given that both interventions are critical to the survival of both the mother and the new born, it is important to identify factors that militate against an effective postnatal care and exclusive breastfeeding in the country, in order to scale up services. The aim was to determine the major barriers to postnatal care and exclusive breastfeeding among urban women in southeastern Nigeria. A cross-sectional survey of 400 urban market women using semistructured questionnaires and focus group discussions. Out of 400 women interviewed, 365 (91.7%) attended postnatal clinic. Lack of knowledge about postnatal care services (42.2%; n = 14), distant location of the hospitals (36.4%; n = 12) and feeling that postnatal visits was not necessary (21.1%; n = 7) were the main reasons for non-attendance to postnatal clinic. With respect to exclusive breastfeeding, 143 (35.9%) of the women practiced EBF. The main reasons for nonpractice of EBF were that EBF was very stressful (26.2%; n = 67), mother's refusal (23.5%; n = 60), and the feeling that EBF was not necessary (18.1%; n = 46). Thirty five (13.7%) of the women were constrained by time while the husband's refusal accounted for 1.5% ( n = 3) of the reasons for nonpractice of exclusive breastfeeding. Poor knowledge and inaccessibility to health facilities were the main obstacles to postnatal care while the practice of exclusive breastfeeding was limited by the stress and mothers refusal.",

We also examined whether food neophobia is associated with parent-child feeding relations or child body fat. We studied sixty-six same-sex twin pairs, including 37 monozygotic (MZ) and 29 dizygotic (DZ) pairs. Food neophobia was assessed by parent questionnaire (Child Food Neophobia Scale, CFNS), as were child feeding practices and \u201cdivision of responsibility\u201d feeding relations. Child anthropometry and percent body fat were directly measured. MZ and DZ twin pair correlations for food neophobia were r=0.71 and r= \u22120.01, respectively; heritability= 72%. Greater food neophobia was associated with reduced child eating compliance of prompted foods (p< 0.001) reduced eating compliance of initially refused foods (p< 0.001), and \u2013 among girls only \u2013 fewer parental food demands (p= 0.01). Interestingly, the correlation between maternal BMI and child BMI z-score was significant only for children high (p=0.03), but not low (p=0.55), in food neophobia. Child food neophobia, a highly heritable trait previously linked to emotionality, was associated with less compliant parent-child feeding relations. Strategies to combat food neophobia and foster more harmonious feeding relationships may have a role in obesity prevention.",

This study aimed to examine if cognitive factors and eating behaviors differ according to calcium intake based on the Social Cognitive Theory. Subjects were female college students in Seoul, Korea. Three hundred students completed the questionnaire regarding calcium intake, nutrition knowledge, outcome expectations, self-efficacy and eating behaviors. Data on 240 students were analyzed using t-test or \u03c7 2 -test. Subjects were categorized into two groups, high calcium intake (HC, \u2265 650 mg/day) and low calcium intake (LC, < 650 mg/day), according to recommended intakes of calcium for women aged 19-29 years. The LC group constituted 77.9% of total subjects. Nutrition knowledge was not different according to calcium intake. Three out of 12 outcome expectations items were significantly different between the HC and LC groups. Subjects in the HC group agreed more strongly with the practical benefits of consuming calcium-rich foods, including 'taste' (P < 0.01) and 'going well with other snacks' ( P < 0.05), compared to those in the LC group. Negative expectations of 'indigestion' were stronger in the LC group than HC group ( P < 0.001). Among self-efficacy items, perceived ability of 'eating dairy foods for snacks' ( P < 0.001), 'eating dairy foods every day' ( P < 0.01), and 'eating calcium-rich side dishes at meals' ( P < 0.05) differed significantly between the HC and LC groups. Eating behaviors including more frequent consumption of dairy foods, fruits or fruit juice ( P < 0.001), anchovy, seaweeds, green vegetables, protein-rich foods ( P < 0.05), and less frequent consumption of sweets or soft drinks ( P < 0.01) were significantly related to calcium intake. This study found that outcome expectations, self-efficacy in consuming calcium-rich foods, and eating behaviors are important in explaining calcium intake. Nutrition education needs to address practical benefits, reduce negative expectations of calcium-rich foods, increase self-efficacy, and modify eating behaviors contributing to calcium intake.",

This was a cross-sectional study of healthy children 1\u20133 years of age. Adjusted multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the association between maternal ethnicity and ID (serum ferritin <12\u2009\u00b5g/L) and the association between maternal ethnicity and five infant feeding practices (breastfeeding duration; bottle use beyond 15 months; current formula use; daily cow\u2019s milk intake >2 cups; meat consumption). Of 1851 children included, 12.2% had ID. Compared with the European referent group, we found higher odds of ID among children of South Asian and West Asian/North African maternal ethnicities, and lower odds of ID among children of East Asian maternal ethnicity. Statistically significant covariates associated with higher odds of ID included longer breastfeeding duration and daily cow\u2019s milk intake >2 cups. Current infant formula use was associated with lower odds of ID. Children of South Asian maternal ethnicity had higher odds of bottle use beyond 15 months of age and lower odds of meat consumption. We found increased odds of ID among children of South Asian and West Asian/Northern African maternal ethnicities. We found a higher odds of feeding practices linked to ID in children of South Asian maternal ethnicity, but not in children of West Asian/North African maternal ethnicity. Culturally tailored approaches to providing guidance to parents on healthy infant feeding practices may be important to prevent ID in early childhood.  NCT01869530 .",

To improve the nation's current situation of breastfeeding, promoting breastfeeding in women undergoing cesarean section is essential. To explore the effects of health belief model-based interventions on breastfeeding knowledge, breastfeeding behaviors, and breastfeeding satisfaction of Chinese cesarean women. A total of 346 cesarean section women were enrolled in the randomized controlled trial conducted at a center in Chengdu, China, between July 1, 2018 and August 31, 2018. While the control group (n\u200a=\u200a173) received conventional breastfeeding guidance only, the intervention group (n\u200a=\u200a173) received additional interventions based on the health belief model. Questionnaires were distributed to assess breastfeeding knowledge, breastfeeding behavior, and breastfeeding satisfaction at discharge, 42 days postpartum, and 4 months postpartum, respectively. At discharge from hospital, the breastfeeding knowledge score of the intervention group was higher than that of the control group ( Z =\u200a\u221211.753, P <\u200a.001). The exclusive breastfeeding rates in the intervention group at the time of discharge, 42 days postpartum, and 4 months postpartum were 67.3%, 60.7%, and 52.9%, respectively, while those of the control group were 41.2%, 41.6%, and 40.4%, respectively.

As GLP \u20101 is cleaved by dipeptidyl peptidase\u20104 yielding a half\u2010life of less than 2\u00a0min, it is plausible that the gut\u2010derived GLP \u20101, released postprandially, exerts its effects on the brain mainly by interacting with vagal afferent neurons located at the intestinal or hepatic portal area. GLP \u20101 neurons in the NTS widely project in the central nervous system and act as a neurotransmitter. One of the physiological roles of brain\u2010derived GLP \u20101 is restriction of feeding. GLP \u20101 receptor agonists have recently been used to treat type\u00a02 diabetic patients, and have been shown to exhibit pleiotropic effects beyond incretin action, which involve brain functions. GLP \u20101 receptor agonist administered in the periphery is stable because of its resistance to dipeptidyl peptidase\u20104, and is highly likely to act on the brain by passing through the blood\u2013brain barrier ( BBB ), as well as interacting with vagal afferent nerves. Central actions of GLP \u20101 have various roles including regulation of feeding, weight, glucose and lipid metabolism, cardiovascular functions, cognitive functions, and stress and emotional responses.

The aim of this cross-sectional study is to investigate the prevalence and related risk factors of ECC in preschool children of urban Bangalore (India). A random sample of 1,500 children aged between 8 and 48 months were selected from various parts of urban Bangalore. The status of dental caries was recorded according to the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria. Information regarding oral hygiene practices, feeding habits, socio-economic status, birth weight, and educational status of the mother was obtained through a structured questionnaire given to mothers of preschool children. The data was subjected to statistical analysis using the Statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) version 12. The prevalence of ECC in preschool children was 27.5%, while the mean deft was 0.854. ECC increased significantly with age. Children whose mothers had no schooling and those who belonged to low socioeconomic group showed higher caries prevalence. A significant increase in caries prevalence was found in children accustomed to the practice of on-demand breast feeding and bottle feeding at night. Caries also increased significantly when snacks were consumed between meals. However, increased frequency of tooth-brushing, parental supervision, use of a baby toothbrush, and fluoridated dentifrice significantly decreased caries prevalence. ECC is a serious public health problem in this population and measures to increase awareness should be undertaken. The target candidates for oral health promotion programs should include mothers, general dentists, pediatricians, nurses, primary care health workers, care-takers at day-care centers and gynecologists.",

    "abstract": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has provided insight on how neural abnormalities are related to the symptomatology of the eating disorders (EDs): anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge eating disorder (BED). More specifically, an increasingly growing number of brain imaging studies has shed light on how func-tionally connected brain networks contribute not only to disturbed eating behavior, but also to transdiagnostic alterations in body/interoceptive perception, reward processing and executive functioning. This narrative review aims to summarize recent advances in fMRI studies of patients with EDs by highlighting studies investigating network alterations that are shared across EDs. Findings on reward processing in both AN and BN patients point to the presence of altered sensi-tivity to salient food stimuli in striatal regions and to the possibility of hypothalamic inputs being overridden by top-down emotional-cognitive control regions. Additionally, innovative new lines of research suggest that increased activations in fron-to-striatal circuits are strongly associated with the maintenance of restrictive eating habits in AN patients. Although signifi-cantly fewer studies have been carried out in patients with BN and BED, aberrant neural responses to both food cues and an-ticipated food receipt appear to occur in these populations. These altered responses, coupled with diminished recruitment of prefrontal cognitive control circuitry, are believed to contribute to the binge eating of palatable foods. Results from functional network connectivity studies are diverse, but findings tend to converge on indicating disrupted resting-state connectivity in executive networks, the default-mode network and the salience network across EDs.",

It is well known that biological, psychosocial, and family-related factors interact in the development of this group of disorders. However, the mechanisms underlying the interaction between these variables are still poorly understood, especially in Portuguese adolescents. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between eating behaviors, body dissatisfaction, self-esteem, and perfectionism in a sample of Portuguese girls. A community sample of 575 Portuguese girls attending secondary school, answered self-report questionnaires including data on weight, height, and the Portuguese versions of the Contour Figures Rating Scale, the Child and Adolescent Perfectionism Scale, the Children Eating Attitudes Test, and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. SPSS version 20.0 for Windows was used for statistical analyses. High scores in the Children Eating Attitudes Test were associated with significantly higher levels of body dissatisfaction (r = 0.339), socially prescribed perfectionism (r = 0.175), self-oriented perfectionism (r = 0.211), and low self-esteem (r = -0.292) (all p < 0.001). Self-oriented perfectionism partially mediated the relation between body dissatisfaction and disordered eating behaviors. In this sample, dysfunctional eating behaviors appeared to correlate strongly with body dissatisfaction, low self-esteem, and perfectionism in girls. These themes should be addressed among female adolescents in the community.",

    "abstract": "Supplemental Digital Content is available in the text The aim of the study was to determine whether exclusive breastfeeding or exclusive formula feeding is more cost-effective when a Canadian mother with HIV is adherent to antiretroviral therapy and has full virologic suppression. Current Canadian guidelines recommend that mothers with HIV practice exclusive formula feeding. This contradicts the updated World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines which recommend that mothers with HIV should breastfeed for \u226512 months while receiving support for antiretroviral therapy adherence. Due to the economic and health risks and benefits associated with each modality, there remains expert disagreement on whether the WHO recommendations should be adopted in high-income countries. A microsimulation model was developed to estimate lifetime costs and effectiveness (i.e., infant's quality-adjusted life years) of a hypothetical group of 1,000,000 initially healthy, HIV-negative infants, if the mother with HIV was on antiretroviral therapy with full virologic suppression and either exclusive breastfeeding or exclusive formula feeding. The model was developed from the economic perspective of the Ontario Ministry of Health, taking into account direct costs associated with infant feeding modality as well as related indirect costs born out of the child's lifetime health outcomes. Uncertainties related to model parameters were evaluated using one-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses. In comparison to exclusive formula feeding, exclusive breastfeeding was the dominant feeding modality (i.e., less costly and more effective) yielding cost-savings of $13,812 per additional quality-adjusted life year gained. Neither one-way nor probabilistic sensitivity analyses altered the conclusions. Despite the risk of HIV transmission, exclusive breastfeeding was more cost-effective than exclusive formula feeding. These findings merit review of current infant feeding guidelines for mothers with HIV living in high-income countries.",

A dominance analysis of psychological variables associated to BD is proposed. Positional, inter-individual and intra-individual factors were investigated. The variables most associated to BD were enhancement motives and drinking identity. The second order variables associated with BD were subjective norm and social motives. Prevention actions may benefit of specifically targeting inter-individual variables. Binge drinking (BD) is a public health concern, especially in young people. Multiple individual factors referring to different level of analyses - positional, inter-individual and intra-individual \u2013 are associated to BD. As they have mainly been explored separately, little is known about the psychological variables most associated with BD. This study, based on an integrative model considering a large number of variables, aims to estimate these associations and possible dominance of some variables in BD. A sample of university students ( N =\u00a02851) participated in an internet survey-based study. They provided information on alcohol related variables (AUDIT, BD score), positional factors (sex, age), inter-individual factors (subjective norm, social identity, external motivations), and intra-individual factors (internal motivations, meta -cognitions, impulsivity and personality traits). The data were processed via a backward regression analysis including all variables and completed with a dominance analysis on variables that are significantly associated with BD intensity. The strongest variables associated with BD intensity were enhancement motives and drinking identity (average \u0394 R 2 =\u00a021.81%), followed by alcohol subjective norm and social motives (average \u0394 R 2 =\u00a013.99%). Other associated variables (average \u0394 R 2 =\u00a02,84%) were negative metacognition on uncontrollability, sex, coping motives, lack of premeditation, positive metacognition on cognitive self-regulation, positive urgency, lack of perseverance, age, conformity motives and loneliness. Results offer new avenues at the empirical level, by spotting particularly inter-individual psychological variables that should be more thoroughly explored, but also at the clinical level, to elaborate new prevention strategies focusing on these specific factors.",

    "abstract": "Prevention and treatment of pain in pediatric patients compared with adults is often not only inadequate but also less often implemented the younger the children are. Children 0 to 17 years are a vulnerable population. To address the prevention and treatment of acute and chronic pain in children, including pain caused by needles, with recommended analgesic starting doses. This Clinical Update elaborates on the 2019 IASP Global Year Against Pain in the Vulnerable \u201cFactsheet Pain in Children: Management\u201d and reviews best evidence and practice. Multimodal analgesia may include pharmacology (eg, basic analgesics, opioids, and adjuvant analgesia), regional anesthesia, rehabilitation, psychological approaches, spirituality, and integrative modalities, which act synergistically for more effective acute pediatric pain control with fewer side effects than any single analgesic or modality. For chronic pain, an interdisciplinary rehabilitative approach, including physical therapy, psychological treatment, integrative mind\u2013body techniques, and normalizing life, has been shown most effective. For elective needle procedures, such as blood draws, intravenous access, injections, or vaccination, overwhelming evidence now mandates that a bundle of 4 modalities to eliminate or decrease pain should be offered to every child every time: (1) topical anesthesia, eg, lidocaine 4% cream, (2) comfort positioning, eg, skin-to-skin contact for infants, not restraining children, (3) sucrose or breastfeeding for infants, and (4) age-appropriate distraction. A deferral process (Plan B) may include nitrous gas analgesia and sedation. Failure to implement evidence-based pain prevention and treatment for children in medical facilities is now considered inadmissible and poor standard of care.",

    "abstract": "Coexistence of multiple tick-borne pathogens or strains is common in natural hosts and can be facilitated by resource partitioning of the host species, within-host localization, or by different transmission pathways. Most vector-borne pathogens are transmitted horizontally via systemic host infection, but transmission may occur in the absence of systemic infection between two vectors feeding in close proximity, enabling pathogens to minimize competition and escape the host immune response. In a laboratory study, we demonstrated that co-feeding transmission can occur for a rapidly-cleared strain of Borrelia burgdorferi , the Lyme disease agent, between two stages of the tick vector Ixodes scapularis while feeding on their dominant host, Peromyscus leucopus . In contrast, infections rapidly became systemic for the persistently infecting strain. In a field study, we assessed opportunities for co-feeding transmission by measuring co-occurrence of two tick stages on ears of small mammals over two years at multiple sites. Finally, in a modeling study, we assessed the importance of co-feeding on R 0 , the basic reproductive number. The model indicated that co-feeding increases the fitness of rapidly-cleared strains in regions with synchronous immature tick feeding. Our results are consistent with increased diversity of B. burgdorferi in areas of higher synchrony in immature feeding \u2013 such as the midwestern United States. A higher relative proportion of rapidly-cleared strains, which are less human pathogenic, would also explain lower Lyme disease incidence in this region. Finally, if co-feeding transmission also occurs on refractory hosts, it may facilitate the emergence and persistence of new pathogens with a more limited host range.",

    "abstract": "Among all barriers to breastfeeding, the need to work has been cited as one of the top reasons for not breastfeeding overall and for early weaning among mothers who seek to breastfeed. We aimed to examine whether extending the duration of paid maternity leave available to new mothers affected early initiation of breastfeeding, exclusive breastfeeding under 6 \u2009months and breastfeeding duration in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). We merged longitudinal data measuring national maternity leave policies with information on breastfeeding related to 992\u2009419 live births occurring between 1996 and 2014 in 38 LMICs that participated in the Demographic and Health Surveys. We used a difference-in-differences approach to compare changes in the prevalence of early initiation and exclusive breastfeeding, as well as the duration of breastfeeding, among treated countries that lengthened their paid maternity leave policy between 1995 and 2013 versus control countries that did not. Regression models included country and year fixed effects, as well as measured individual-level, household-level and country-level covariates. All models incorporated robust SEs and respondent-level sampling weights. A 1-month increase in the legislated duration of paid maternity leave was associated with a 7.4 percentage point increase (95% \u2009CI 3.2 to 11.7) in the prevalence of early initiation of breastfeeding, a 5.9 percentage point increase (95% \u2009CI 2.0 to 9.8) in the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding and a 2.2-\u2009month increase (95% \u2009CI 1.1 to 3.4) in breastfeeding duration. Extending the duration of legislated paid maternity leave appears to promote breastfeeding practices in LMICs. Our findings suggest a potential mechanism to reduce barriers to breastfeeding for working mothers.",

We aimed to determine the factors affecting EBF duration in a sample of Iranian infants. This prospective study was conducted between April 2012 and October 2014 in Fars, Iran. Women (N=2640), who had given birth to healthy term infants were categorized into EBF versus non-EBF groups. Demographic information from mothers and infants, medical and drug history, and pregnancy related factors were compared between the two groups. Multivariable analysis was performed using Adaptive Lasso regression. P<0.05 was considered significant. The mean duration of EBF was 4.63\u00b11.99 months. There was an inverse association between the mother\u2019s educational level and duration of EBF (P<0.001). Also, we found that mothers who were housewives had a significantly longer duration of EBF (4.68\u00b11.97) compared to mothers with either part-time (4.21\u00b12.01) or full-time jobs (4.02\u00b12.12) (P<0.001). By eliminating the redundant factors, the proposed multivariable model showed the infant\u2019s weight gain during EBF, singleton/multiple pregnancies, maternal perception of quantity of breast milk, post-partum infection, use of pacifier, neonate\u2019s irritability, birth place and mother\u2019s full-time job as the most important factors affecting the duration of EBF. Twin pregnancies, post-partum infection, cesarean section by maternal request, use of a pacifier and irritability in the neonatal period significantly reduced the duration of EBF. Health policy-makers should promote EBF programs among the educated as well as working mothers in order to positively affect the community\u2019s health status.",

Therefore, we aimed to compare clinical symptoms and life styles such as sleep disorders and eating attitude in FD patients visiting general practitioners at primary clinics with those consulting gastroenterologists at tertiary clinics to clarify healthcare-seeking patterns in Japanese patients. Fifty-one FD outpatients in a tertiary clinic (college hospital), 50 FD outpatients visiting primary clinics and 50 healthy volunteers were enrolled. Clinical symptoms, quality of life, sleep disorders, eating attitude and anxiety were estimated using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS), Social Functioning-8 (SF-8) test, Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) test and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) for FD outpatients and healthy volunteers. FD outpatients exhibited higher mean scores of GSRS than healthy volunteers. The SF-8 physical component summary scores in the tertiary clinic group were significantly lower than those in the primary clinic group. GSRS scores were significantly ( P < 0.001, P = 0.002) associated with global PSQI scores in FD outpatients as well as with STAI-trait scores ( P = 0.006, P = 0.001) compared to healthy volunteers. The frequency of eating between meals in the primary clinic group was significantly ( P < 0.05) higher than that in the tertiary clinic group. It may be important for clarification of healthcare-seeking behavior to determine the difference in both impairment of physical quality of life and eating attitudes between tertiary clinic and primary clinic FD outpatients in Japan.",

We conducted this telephone survey to evaluate breastfeeding disruption during hospitalisation for bronchiolitis and try to identify its determining factors for future interventions. This cross-sectional study extends over one epidemic season of bronchiolitis in a tertiary care hospital. All patients aged 6 months or younger hospitalised with acute bronchiolitis and receiving at least partial breast feeding were eligible for the study (n=144). Patients discharged home whose parents accepted to be contacted for a phone survey were included. Parents were contacted 3 months (range 0.5\u20136) after discharge. Eighty-four patients were included in the study. Median length of hospital stay was 3 days (1; 34), and 27 patients spent some time in paediatric intensive care unit. Forty-three mothers stated that hospitalisation modified their breast feeding (17 stopped, 12 switched to partial breast feeding and 14 reduced without stopping). Mothers stated that the causes of breastfeeding disturbance were lack of support and advices (n=27) followed by child\u2019s respiratory disease (n=14), logistic hospital difficulties (n=13) and personal organisation issues (n=4). Admission to hospital with bronchiolitis may adversely affect breast feeding. Correct advices and support could be a determining factor, and further studies should focus on preventive interventions.",

    "abstract": "Since chronic diseases have emerged as a major cause of death worldwide, people has been exposed to large amounts of information on healthy eating practices that are important aspects of its prevention and management. Food literacy, the functional, interactive, and critical ability to manage dietary information with the aim of improving health, is of global interest. In South Korea (hereafter Korea), there is currently a lack of food literacy research, despite its pertinence for the development of public health policies that are tailored to recipients' ability to understand and address health and nutrition issues. In this study, the research trend and policy implications of food literacy are derived through reviewing preceding studies related to food literacy in Korea and elsewhere. Existing literature on food literacy in Korea placed much emphasis on the functional ability of food literacy. Future research on the operational definitions of interactive and critical food literacy and their health effects in Korea is necessary. In addition, there is a lack of research on the development and validation of measurement tools that evaluate integrative concepts of food literacy. To accurately examine the relationships among food literacy, diet, and health, standardized measurement tools that can comprehensively evaluate food literacy frameworks for various Korean sub-population groups should be developed. Based on such future studies, an investigation of health promotion programs or policies on reducing the cognitive burden of food literacy would contribute to improving heathy eating practices in Korea.",

An 81-year-old female developed a neurotrophic central ulcer with descemetocele in the right eye, and her visual acuity was count fingers at 30 cm. She was unresponsive to medical treatment, and an uneventful manual DALK was performed. Six months after surgery, unaided visual acuity improved to 6/30. Seven months after surgery, the patient had a decrease in visual acuity to count fingers in the same eye. She was diagnosed as having corneal melting with a central descemetocele in the previous lamellar graft. A repeat manual DALK graft was performed. Lamellar dissection was performed starting from the edge of descemetocele, proceeding to the corneal periphery and maintaining the surgical plane of the previous DALK. During the surgical procedure, continuous and localized sweating of aqueous through Descemet\u2019s membrane was observed in the area of the descemetocele. After drying of the recipient bed, no visible perforation of Descemet\u2019s membrane was found. After removal of the previous DALK graft, a new stromal lamellar graft was sutured. The surgery was concluded without complications. One day after surgery, the graft was clear, with no detachment of Descemet\u2019s membrane. If Descemet\u2019s membrane sweating is observed during DALK and there is no visible perforation, the reason may be a hidden micron perforation in an intact Descemet\u2019s membrane.

Although behavioral factors, including eating habits and sedentary lifestyles, are considered to be determinants of obesity, the specific childhood factors that contribute to this condition have not been clearly defined. The subjects consisted of 261 children aged 7-9 years who were recruited from an elementary school during October 2003. Information was obtained from their parents using a questionnaire focused on eating behaviors and lifestyle factors, additional data were also collected via anthropometric measurements and biochemical examinations, including blood tests. A total of 48 (18.4%) of the 261 children were overweight, and 34 (70.8%) had at least one other component of metabolic syndrome. Eating behaviors emerged as significant lifestyle-related risk factors for being overweight or obese. Those who engaged in overeating more than twice per week had three times the risk of being overweight (odds ratio [OR], 3.10, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.39 to 6.92), and those who ate rapidly had three times the risk of being overweight (OR, 3.28; 95% CI, 1.68 to 6.41). Those who had fewer family meals (fewer than 2-3/month) had a nine times higher risk of being overweight than those who had family meals more frequently (at least 1/day) (OR, 9.51; 95% CI, 1.21 to 74.82). This study showed that being overweight or obese during preadolescence is associated with a higher risk of metabolic syndrome and is related to unhealthy eating behaviors. Thus, weight-control strategies and healthy eating behaviors should be developed early in life to reduce the risk for metabolic syndrome.",

To study the relationship between executive functions and binge eating behaviors. Executive functions do not differ along non-clinical binge eating patterns. Binge eating disorder might be related with small deficits in executive function. Mood disorders linked with severe binge eating might influence cognitive deficits. Binge eating disorder (BED) is a common psychiatric diagnosis characterized by the presence of episodes of loss of control over food consumption. Understanding the neurocognitive factors associated with binge eating pathology might help to design clinical strategies aimed at preventing or treating BED. However, results in the field are notably heterogeneous. In the current study, we aimed to establish whether binge eating behaviors (both at a clinical and at a non-clinical level) are associated with executive functions. We performed a pre-registered meta -analysis to examine the link between executive functions, BED, and uncontrolled eating, a psychobiological construct closely associated with binge eating behaviors. Articles were searched on PubMed and the main exclusion criteria were lack of information about participants\u2019 age or sex distribution or adiposity measurements, studies performed in older populations (age\u00a0>\u00a065\u00a0years old) or studies including participants with purging symptoms. Relative to healthy controls, patients with BED showed lower performance in executive functions, with a small effect size. At the same time, uncontrolled eating patterns were not associated with differences in executive functions. Neither age nor body mass index (BMI) influenced these results. Our findings suggest that there is no association between performance in executive functions and variations along the non-clinical spectrum of binge eating behaviors. Small deficits in executive functions, however, seem to appear in individuals showing severe binge eating symptoms, that is, individuals meeting diagnostic criteria for BED. We speculate that the close links between BED and emotional distress could partly explain these results.",

    "abstract": "A history of an eating disorder (ED) might constitute a risk for symptom deterioration and relapse during COVID\u201019 pandemic. This longitudinal study investigates ED symptom trajectories until the first COVID\u201019 lockdown in Spring 2020 in patients with a history of binge eating disorder (BED). Participants of the randomised\u2010controlled BED treatment trial IMPULS participated in a re\u2010assessment directly after the first COVID\u201019 lockdown in Germany. We used expert\u2010rated clinical interviews and self\u2010report to investigate binge eating (BE) frequency, ED and general psychopathology, distress, emotion regulation and sense of coherence. Symptom trajectories were analysed for baseline when entering the trial, end of trial participation and the time point directly after lockdown. BE frequency was assessed on a recall basis for 4 weeks directly before lockdown and 4 weeks during lockdown. BE frequency, general ED pathology and depressive symptoms markedly increased after as compared to before the COVID\u201019 outbreak. Individuals scoring high on reappraisal as emotion regulation strategy and sense of coherence scored lower on general ED pathology. Individuals with a history of an ED are at risk for symptom deterioration and relapse during the pandemic. Intervention and service dissemination strategies are needed to support vulnerable groups throughout the pandemic.  A well\u2010described sample of previously treatment\u2010seeking patients with binge eating disorder was reassessed directly after the first COVID\u201019 lockdown in spring 2020. Binge eating frequency was markedly increased after as compared to before the COVID\u201019 outbreak.

    "abstract": "Continued feeding and increasing fluids is the cornerstone treatment package for a child with acute diarrhea. However, there is a deficiency of evidence on child feeding practice during a diarrheal episode globally and particularly in low-income countries. This study aimed at assessing feeding practice during diarrheal episodes and associated factors among mothers/caregivers with 6\u201359-month-old children visiting health centers in Shanan Dhuggo district, West Hararge zone, Oromia region, Ethiopia. A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted from March 10 to April 25, 2019 on 422 mothers/caregivers of children 6\u201359 months of age with diarrhea. Data collection was conducted using a pretested tool. Epi Data version 3.1 was utilized for data entry and it was transported to SPSS version 20 for analysis. Descriptive statistical analysis was conducted, and a relationship between outcome variables and independent variables were examined using logistic regression models.

    "abstract": "Airborne microorganisms and microbial by-products from intensive livestock and manure management systems are a potential health risk to workers and individuals in nearby communities. This report presents information on zoonotic pathogens in animal wastes and the generation, fate, and transport of bioaerosols associated with animal feeding operations and land applied manures. Though many bioaerosol studies have been conducted at animal production facilities, few have investigated the transport of bioaerosols during the land application of animal manures. As communities in rural areas converge with land application sites, concerns over bioaerosol exposure will certainly increase. Although most studies at animal operations and wastewater spray irrigation sites suggest a decreased risk of bioaerosol exposure with increasing distance from the source, many challenges remain in evaluating the health effects of aerosolized pathogens and allergens in outdoor environments. To improve our ability to understand the off-site transport and diffusion of human and livestock diseases, various dispersion models have been utilized. Most studies investigating the transport of bioaerosols during land application events have used a modified Gaussian plume model. Because of the disparity among collection and analytical techniques utilized in outdoor studies, it is often difficult to evaluate health effects associated with aerosolized pathogens and allergens. Invaluable improvements in assessing the health effects from intensive livestock practices could be made if standardized bioaerosol collection and analytical techniques, as well as the use of specific target microorganisms, were adopted.",

    "abstract": "Psychometric network analysis has led to new possibilities to assess the structure and dynamics of psychiatric disorders. The current study focuses on mental health networks in patients with anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder and other specified eating disorders (EDs). Network analyses were applied with five mental health domains (emotional, psychological and social well\u2010being, and general and specific psychopathology) among 905 ED patients. Also, networks of 36 underlying symptoms related to the domains were estimated. The network stability, structure and (bridge) centrality of the nodes were assessed for the total group and each ED type. Network differences between the ED types were also examined. ED psychopathology was only weakly connected with the well\u2010being domains. Psychological well\u2010being was the most central node in the domain network. The most central nodes in the symptom network were feeling depressed , feeling worthless , purpose in life and self\u2010acceptance . Bridge symptoms between well\u2010being and psychopathology were self\u2010acceptance , environmental mastery , interested in life and feeling depressed . There were no network differences between the ED types in both the domain and symptom networks. This study shows novel associations between well\u2010being and psychopathology in ED patients. Central domains and their underlying symptoms may be especially important to consider in treatment for promoting mental health in ED patients.  Psychometric network analysis shows novel associations between well\u2010being and psychopathology in eating disorder (ED) patients. The most central mental health domain and underlying symptoms were psychological well\u2010being, feeling depressed feeling worthless, purpose in life and self\u2010acceptance.

    "abstract": "Eating disorders (EDs) and substance use disorders (SUDs) commonly co-occur, especially in conjunction with affective syndromes, yet little is known about opiate abuse and ED symptoms in patients on naltrexone-bupropion therapy. Moreover, evidence suggests that the opioid system can also be regarded as one of the major systems regulating the anticipatory processes preceding binge eating episodes. The lack of evidence in the effectiveness of psychotherapy treatment in addition to psychotropic mediations compounds the difficulties in stabilizing individuals with EDs. This article aims to exhaustively review literature relating to the use of opioid antagonists in the management of binge eating disorder (BED) and other abnormal eating habits and how this can be augmented by the use of psychological approaches to come up with the most effective therapy or combination of therapies to manage these conditions. Although this approach is promising, it has not been evaluated. A review of the literature pertaining to the use of naltrexone in patients with EDs was performed through PubMed, PsycINFO and MEDLINE. We selected 63 relevant articles published between 1981 and 2018 and those written in English. Search terms included \u201cOpioid antagonists\u201d, \u201cnaltrexone\u201d, \u201cbupropion\u201d and \u201cPsychotherapy\u201d each combined with \u201cBinge Eating Disorder\u201d, \u201cBulimia Nervosa\u201d, \u201cAnorexia Nervosa\u201d, \u201cEating Disorder\u201d, \u201cEDNOS\u201d and \u201cObesity\u201d. While working with these articles, we also identified several problems related to use of these methods in real clinical practice. Seventy-seven articles were reviewed, and 63 were selected for inclusion. Data obtained from these sources confirmed that the blockade of opioid receptors diminishes food intake. More recent findings also indicate that the combination of bupropion and naltrexone can induce weight loss. Augmentation of this by introducing psychotherapy may lead to better outcomes. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) was the most frequently recommended psychotherapy intervention, showing efficacy for EDs and chemical addictions as documented by most of the studies, but with uncertain efficacy when utilized as augmentation strategy. There are limited data supporting the use of psychotherapy in augmentation of standard therapy in ED; however, there is evidence to support that psychotherapy is safe in this population and has been effective in cases of patients with opiate addiction with and without psychiatric comorbidities as well as BED. More research is needed to establish treatment guidelines. Combining pharmacotherapeutic and psychotherapeutic interventions leads to the achievement of a better outcome in managing patients with EDs. Involving families or the use of support groups increases chances of adherence to the prescribed interventions resulting in higher rates of remission. However, it is clear that all of these interventions must occur in the context of a comprehensive treatment program. We believe that patient-specific psychotherapy may not only facilitate the treatment process, but also cause significant alterations in eating pattern. This approach for BED may lead to more significant treatment outcomes, but this possibility must be tested in larger samples.",

    "abstract": "Prelacteal feeding is an underestimated problem in a developing country like India, where infant mortality rate is quite high. The present study tried to find out the factors determining prelacteal feeding in rural areas of north India. A crosssectional study was conducted among recently delivered women of rural Uttar Pradesh, India. Multistage random sampling was used for selecting villages. From them, 352 recently delivered women were selected as the subjects, following systematic random sampling. Chi-square test and logistic regression were used to find out the predictors for prelacteal feeding. Overall, 40.1% of mothers gave prelacteal feeding to their newborn. Factors significantly associated with such practice, after simple logistic regression, were age, caste, socioeconomic status, and place of delivery. At multivariate level, age (odds ratio (OR) = 1.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.13-2.74), caste and place of delivery (OR = 2.23, 95% CI = 1.21-4.10) were found to determine prelacteal feeding significantly, indicating that young age, high caste, and home deliveries could affect the practice positively. The problem of prelacteal feeding is still prevalent in rural India. Age, caste, and place of delivery were associated with the problem. For ensuring neonatal health, the problem should be addressed with due gravity, with emphasis on exclusive breast feeding.",

    "abstract": "We investigated the presence of disordered eating attitudes and weight perception among young women at body mass index (BMI) values that correspond to underweight, normal weight, overweight, and obese weight status. Data were collected from 1,147 female undergraduate students (89% Kuwaiti nationals) recruited from Kuwait University through employment of the eating attitude test (EAT\u201026) together with an anonymous, self\u2010administered questionnaire to determine the prevalence of symptomatology indicative of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. The mean EAT\u201026 scores differed significantly between the weight categories. More students with overweight and obesity scored above the established EAT\u201026 cut off value indicating at risk of disordered eating compared to students who were at a normal weight or underweight (52.1% vs. 38.8%, respectively, X  2 (1) =16.1, p < .001). Logistic regression analyses showed significantly higher odds ratios (ORs) for the groups with overweight and obesity for dieting and bulimic behaviors, while women at normal and underweight had higher ORs for restrictive oral control behaviors associated with anorexia nervosa. Distorted weight perception was found in all weight categories. The high proportion of disordered eating attitudes among Kuwaiti college women could not be attributed to obesity alone as the type of disordered eating behavior varied more by weight perception than by weight status. The high levels of eating disorder related symptoms could be due to a combination of the social influences, diet, and lifestyle of college students. Such factors need to be considered by healthcare professionals as early as possible with more focused programs towards promotion of healthy weight for college students.",

There was weak evidence, of borderline statistical significance, that having been breastfed was associated with a small reduction in the odds ratios for leukaemia (odds ratio = 0.89, 95% Cl 0.80\u20131.00, P = 0.06), and for all cancers combined (odds ratio = 0.92, 95% Cl 0.84\u20131.00, P = 0.05). Combining data from the UKCCS with results from other published studies showed a small reduction in the odds ratios for leukaemia, Hodgkin's disease, non-haematological cancers, and all childhood cancers combined, associated with ever having been breastfed.

    "abstract": "Few species of true butterflies (Lepidoptera: Papilionoidea) have evolved a proboscis that greatly exceeds the length of the body. This study is the first to examine the morphology of an extremely long butterfly proboscis and to describe how it is used to obtain nectar from flowers with very deep corolla tubes. The proboscis of Eurybia lycisca (Riodinidae) is approximately twice as long as the body. It has a maximal length of 45.6\u00a0mm (mean length 36.5\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00b1\u00a04.1\u00a0S.D., N =\u00a020) and is extremely thin, measuring only about 0.26\u00a0mm at its maximum diameter. The proboscis has a unique arrangement of short sensilla at the tip, and its musculature arrangement is derived. The flower handling times on the preferred nectar plant, Calathea crotalifera (Marantaceae), were exceptionally long (mean 54.5\u00a0sec\u00a0\u00b1\u00a028.5\u00a0S.D., N =\u00a026). When feeding on the deep flowers remarkably few proboscis movements occur. The relationship between Eurybia lycisca and its preferred nectar plant and larval host plant, Calathea crotalifera , is not mutualistic since the butterfly exploits the flowers without contributing to their pollination. We hypothesize that the extraordinarily long proboscis of Eurybia lycisca is an adaptation for capitalizing on the pre-existing mutualistic interaction of the host plant with its pollinating long-tongued nectar feeding insects. \u25baThe butterfly Eurybia lycisca has a proboscis measuring twice the body size. \u25baFlower-visiting and proboscis morphology is examined for the first time. \u25baLong flower handling times are balanced by high nectar rewards. \u25baDerived proboscis musculature and sensillum equipment were detected. \u25baThe butterfly steals nectar without pollinating its preferred host plant.",

A group-randomized trial design was used in this study. A total of 108 rural-dwelling children from a community in the Enugu North agricultural zone, Enugu State, who participated in the study. The children were randomly assigned to 2 groups: the treatment group (n\u200a=\u200a54) and the no-treatment control group (n\u200a=\u200a54). The child eating behavior questionnaire was used for data collection. Parents of the participating children within each study group completed the child eating behavior questionnaire at 3 time points. The data collected were analyzed using an independent sample t test at a probability level of .05. The outcome of the study showed that the children's eating habits in the treatment group improved positively following the community-based nutritional counseling intervention. The positive gain from exposure to the community-based nutritional counseling intervention program was sustained during follow-up for children in the treatment group compared with the no-treatment group. The community-based nutrition counseling intervention carried out among children in rural communities had a positive adjustment in children's eating habits. The intervention requires the constant collaboration of professional childhood educators, caregivers, home economists, school staff, healthcare specialists, families, and the children themselves. Furthermore, there is a need for future long-term evaluations of the effects of community-based nutritional counseling interventions on children's nutrition and eating habits.",

Mothers\u2019 increased awareness provides the right care and nutrition to these children in order to grow and achieve their developmental milestones. This study aimed at (1) assessing mothers' awareness on breastfeeding and formula-milk feeding, weaning, growth, and development of infants with cleft lip and palate and (2) the relationship of mothers\u2019 awareness with their level of education and monthly household income. This cross-sectional pilot study included all the mothers of infants aged up to one year who had cleft lip and/or palate attended Dental Teaching Hospital, Peradeniya between the years 2015 and 2016. Mothers of infants with oral clefts associated with other syndromic features and chronic illnesses were excluded. A pre-tested interviewer-administered questionnaire was designed to collect data. To assess the clarity of the questions, prior to the study, the questionnaire was pre-tested in 10 mothers of infants with an oral cleft but not selected for the study. Frequency distributions and descriptive statistics were used to describe study variables. Spearman Rank test was used to determine the association of mothers\u2019 awareness with their level of education and monthly household income with a 95% confidence interval. The sample consisted of 101 mothers who had infants born with a cleft and the response rate was 100%. Except one, all mothers reported that they have received overall feeding instructions either from a doctor, nurse, cleft center staff or a midwife. Over 65.3% of mothers were aware of feeding-related factors including; breastfeeding, formula-milk feeding, and weaning of infants with a cleft. Overall more than 80% of mothers were aware of factors related to growth and development of the child including urination, sleeping pattern, weight and growth charts. The education level of mothers was not significantly associated with mothers' awareness of any factors related to breastfeeding, formula-milk feeding, weaning and growth, and development. Further, mothers\u2019 awareness of breastmilk as the best food for babies under 6 months (p = 0.028), weaning at 4\u20136 months (p = 0.024), replacing milk feeds by weaning foods (p = 0.02) and not providing junk foods to infants in between main meals (p = 0.01) were significantly associated with monthly household income. The findings of this study suggest that mothers were aware of factors related to feeding infants with a cleft lip and palate and their growth and development. The awareness of mothers about certain factors related to feeding and weaning was significantly associated with monthly household income.

Three systematic reviews and meta-analyses have recently been published on psychological treatments for anorexia nervosa. Treatment outcomes are still modest and mainly focus on weight outcome, although outcomes for eating disorder disease and quality of life have also been reported. Adhering to a treatment protocol might lead to faster and better results. For children and adolescents with anorexia nervosa, the major guidelines recommend a family-based treatment. The treatments of choice for young adults and adults with anorexia nervosa are the Maudsley Anorexia Nervosa Treatment for Adults (MANTRA), Cognitive Behaviour Therapy-Enhanced (CBT-E) and Specialist Supportive Clinical Management (SSCM), but none of these treatments seem to be superior. In search of other ways to improve outcome, shared decision making may be a way to help patients become more involved in their treatment, enhance their motivation and consequently improve the outcome.",

    "abstract": "COVID-19 continues to be an ongoing global threat.  The elderly with underlying health conditions like cardiovascular and lung diseases, diabetes, obesity, are the most vulnerable to this disease. Curing the pre-existing health conditions will greatly increase a person\u2019s resilience to COVID-19 and lower the death rate of the old people. Digestion and immunity form an integrated nutrition acquisition process, especially in obtaining essential amino acids and essential fatty acids from living microbial cells. A mature strong immunity coupled with gut dysbiosis in adults is the main cause of nutritional disorders like morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. Nutrition disorders in return worsen dysbiosis. Human microbiome has an intrinsic duality. While a diverse microbiome provides a full spectrum of essential nutrients to our body, nutrition disorders fuel overgrowth of microbiota (dysbiosis) at many sites on or inside our body, and are the main causes of chronic inflammation at these sites. In the case of COVID-19, nutritional disorder impairs the immunity, causes hyperinflammation, and leads to the protracted overload of cytokines by the immune system, i.e., the cytokine storm. Autophagy induced by restrictive eating is an ideal inhibitor of microbiota overgrowth, as autophagy deprives microbiota of excessive nutrition for replication. Autophagy also attenuates inflammation. Therefore, as a precaution, the author suggests restoring good health in the elderly with the support from a diverse gut microbiome and daily regular food intake restriction, so as to lower the risk of developing into severe case even if they are infected by COVID-19.",

    "abstract": "Food restriction has been recommended as an effective strategy for body weight loss. However, food restriction can alter biological rhythms and leads to physiological stress. However, relatively little is known about the physiological impact of different methods of food restriction. Therefore, we investigated whether different schedules of restricted food intake induce physiological stress and then contribute to glucose metabolism disorder. C57BL/6 mice were fed a high fat diet (60% fat) for 8 weeks and then randomly divided into three groups: the control group was continuously fed the high fat diet; the two food restriction groups were fed 50% of food consumed by the control mice with one group (FR1) being fed the full amount once a day and the other group (FR2) being fed the same total amount as FR1 twice a day for 3 days. We found increased body weight loss, the serum triglyceride levels, the expression of lipolysis-related genes, and serum corticosterone levels in the FR1 group compared with the FR2 group. The immune cell population infiltrating the adipose tissue and the expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) and toll-like receptor (TLR-4) mRNA were increased in the FR1 group compared with the control. To determine whether long-term dietary manipulation is associated with metabolic disorders, mice were fed a restricted diet for 3 days alternating with an unrestricted diet for the following 4 days and this was repeated for 8 weeks. The alternating FR1 group showed impaired glucose tolerance compared with the alternating FR2 group. These results indicate that infrequent feeding of restricted amounts of food could induce stress hormones, lipolysis, adipose tissue immune cell infiltration and inflammation, which in turn may promote glucose metabolism disorder.",

    "abstract": "In brain, CREB-regulated transcription co-activator 1 (CRTC1) is involved in metabolic dysregulation. In humans a SNP in CRTC1 was associated to body fat percentage and two SNPs affected RNA Pol II binding and chromatin structure, implying epigenetic regulation of CRTC1 . We sought to understand the relevance of CRTC1 SNPs, DNA methylation and expression in human eating behaviour and its relationship to clinical variables of obesity in blood and adipose tissue. 13 CRTC1 SNPs were included to analyze eating behaviour. For rs7256986, follow up association analyses were applied on DNA methylation, CRTC1 expression and clinical parameters. Linear regression was used throughout the study adjusted for age, sex and BMI. Besides data extraction from previous work, rs7256986 was de-novo genotyped and DNA methylation was evaluated by using pyrosequencing. We found several SNPs in the CRTC1 locus nominally associated with human eating behaviour or 2hr postprandial insulin levels and observed a correlation with alcohol and coffee intake (all P <\u202f0.05). G-allele carriers of rs7256986 showed slightly increased hip circumference. We showed that rs7256986 represents a methylation quantitative trait locus (meQTL) in whole blood and adipose tissue. The presence of the SNP and/or DNA methylation correlated with CRTC1 gene expression which in turn, related to BMI and fat distribution. Our data support the known role of CRCT1 regulating energy metabolism in brain. Here, we highlight relevance of CRTC1 regulation in blood and adipose tissue.

    "abstract": "Breastfeeding reduces major causes of infant mortality and morbidity. On the other hand, it is a major mode of vertical HIV transmission. In developing countries like Ethiopia, HIV positive mothers are advised to continue breastfeeding up to 12 months. But there is scarce literature regarding the mothers\u2019 adherence to continued breastfeeding recommendations. Therefore, the objective of this study is to assess HIV positive mothers\u2019 adherence to the infant feeding recommendations of the new World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for HIV-exposed infants aged \u22656 months. A cross-sectional study was conducted in health institutions with antiretroviral therapy and prevention of mother to child transmission facilities in Sidama Zone, Southern Ethiopia. Health institutions were considered as clusters and cluster sampling technique was employed. A total of 184 HIV positive mothers with their infants registered at respective health institutions were recruited and assessed for their infant breastfeeding practices. Descriptive statistics (frequency, mean, median, and standard deviation) were computed to describe the breastfeeding practices of HIV positive mothers. Almost all (181 [98.4%]) of the HIV-exposed infants were \u201cever breastfed\u201d. Among those mothers who had ever breastfed, 158 (87.3%) initiated breastfeeding within an hour of delivery and 157 (85.8%) had fed their babies colostrum while 31 (16.8%) gave prelacteal food to their infants. The prevalence of continued breastfeeding at 1 year was (54.5%) (46.9% for urban mothers and 75% for rural mothers). Seventy-one percent (70.9%) of HIV positive mothers practiced \u201con demand\u201d breastfeeding. Twenty nine percent of infants aged 6\u201311 months and 47.8% of infants aged \u226512 months were no longer breastfed. The mean (\u00b1 standard deviation) duration of breastfeeding was 7.8 (\u00b13.1) months (95% confidence interval: 6.9\u20138.7). The 2010 WHO guidelines and recommendations on breastfeeding duration for HIV positive mothers was not adhered to after 6 months of age. Promotion and counseling of optimal breastfeeding practice for HIV positive mothers based on the updated WHO guideline is an appropriate intervention. However, further research is recommended to evaluate the acceptance of the new 2010 WHO guideline by the health professionals and HIV positive mothers.",

    "abstract": "Group-living folivorous primates can experience competition for food, and feeding competition has also been documented for solitarily foraging gummivorous and omnivorous primates. However, little is known about the types and consequences of feeding competition in solitary folivorous foragers. We conducted this study in the spiny forest of Berenty Reserve, southern Madagascar, to characterize the competitive regime of the nocturnal solitarily foraging white-footed sportive lemur ( Lepilemur leucopus ), a species that lives in dispersed pairs. We analyzed 1,213\u2009hr of behavioral observations recorded simultaneously for the male and female of each of seven social units and recorded seasonal changes in food availability over a complete annual cycle. Lepilemur leucopus exhibited low selectivity in its dietary choice and mainly included the most abundant plant species in its diet. Contrary to our predictions, we did not find evidence for increased rates of contest (i.e., displacement from food trees) or scramble competition (i.e., shared use of food patches) during the lean season, neither within nor between social units. Instead, conflict rates were low throughout the year, and, during these observations, any feeding stress may have been more related to food quality than quantity. The resource defense hypotheses may not explain pair-living in this species as there was no indication that males defend food resources for their female pair-partners. The observed lack of feeding competition may indicate that a cryptic anti-predator strategy is a better predictor of spatial avoidance of pair-partners than conflict over food. While anti-predator benefits of crypsis may explain, at least partly, female-female avoidance, studies on the relationship between territory size/quality and reproductive success are required to understand whether feeding competition reduces the potential for female association in L. leucopus .",

    "abstract": "While the impacts of illicit drug use on mortality have been well described, the impact of poly-substance that includes alcohol has received less attention. We examined the impact of binge alcohol use on mortality among a cohort of people who inject drugs (PWID) in a Canadian setting. Using data derived from a prospective cohort study of PWID in Vancouver, Canada recruited between May 1996 and November 2013. We ascertained dates and causes of death through a confidential linkage with the provincial registry and examined the impact of binge alcohol use. The primary outcome of interest was all-cause mortality. We used Cox proportional hazard regression to determine factors associated with mortality, including socio-demographic characteristics, drug use patterns and other risk behaviours. During the study period, 2550 individuals were followed (844 of whom were HIV positive at baseline) for a median of 75.4\u00a0months (interquartile range 37.9\u2013113.2). Of these, 795 (31%) participants reported binge alcohol use at some time during the study period. In multivariable analyses, binge alcohol use remained independently associated with all-cause-mortality (adjusted hazard ratio\u00a0=\u00a01.41; 95% confidence interval: 1.06\u20131.88) after adjustment for other drug use patterns. Binge alcohol use was associated with time to all-cause mortality among PWID in this setting. Since alcohol use is often overlooked as a risk factor for mortality among this population, these findings highlight the continued need to incorporate addiction treatment and public health interventions and policies that address binge alcohol use to reduce alcohol related-harms. \u2022 The impact of poly-substance use with alcohol on mortality is not well-described in the literature. \u2022 Binge alcohol use was examined in two prospective cohort studies in Vancouver, Canada. \u2022 We examined all-cause mortality for people who inject drugs (PWID). \u2022 In this setting, binge alcohol use is positively and independently associated with all-cause mortality.

The present study aimed to investigate the association between religion and health behaviors among primary care patients in Korea. We analyzed data from the Family Cohort Study in Primary Care. Among the 1,040 participants in the cohort, 973 of those who had reported their religion were included in the analysis. Participants completed standardized questionnaires that included religious status and lifestyle factors, such as physical activity, smoking status, drinking status, and dietary habits. The association between religion and health behaviors was analyzed using multivariate logistic regression models. Among the 973 participants, 345 (35.5%) were Christian, 153 (15.7%) were Roman Catholic, 308 (31.7%) were Buddhist, and 163 (16.8%) did not have any religion. Compared with those without a religion, the odds ratio (OR) for vigorous physical activity (OR, 1.52; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.01\u20132.28) increased, and that for binge drinking (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.46\u20130.78) and problematic drinking (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.35\u20130.99) decreased among participants with a religion.

    "abstract": "Physical and psychological symptom burden in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) is significantly debilitating; yet, it is often inadequately treated. Legalization of cannabis in Canada may attract increasing interest from patients for its medical use in refractory symptom management, but its indications and long-term adverse health impacts are poorly established, creating a challenge for clinicians to support its use. In this review, we summarize key clinical studies and the level of evidence for nonsynthetic cannabinoids in the treatment of common symptoms encountered in advanced stages of CKD, including chronic pain, nausea and vomiting, anorexia, pruritus, and insomnia. Medline and Embase A search was conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE (inception to March 1, 2018) on cannabis and CKD symptoms of interest, complemented with a manual review of bibliographies. Studies that examined synthetic cannabinoids that are manufactured to mimic the effects of \u22069-tetrahydrocannabinol such as dronabinol, levonantradol, nabilone, and ajulemic acid were excluded. We focused on studies with higher level of evidence where available, and quality of studies was graded based on the Oxford Centre for Evidence-based Medicine Levels of Evidence (1a to 5). Based on studies conducted in patients without renal impairment, those treated with nonsynthetic cannabinoids were 43% to 300% more likely to report a \u226530% reduction in chronic neuropathic pain compared with placebo. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend nonsynthetic cannabinoids for other medical indications, although preliminary investigation into topical endocannabinoids for uremia-induced pruritus in end-stage renal disease is promising. Finally, any benefits of cannabis may be offset by potential harms in the form of cognitive impairment, increased risk of mortality post-myocardial infarction, orthostatic hypotension, respiratory irritation, and malignancies (with smoked cannabis). Nonsynthetic cannabinoid preparations were highly variable between studies, sample sizes were small, and study durations were short. Due to an absence of studies conducted in CKD, recommendations were primarily extrapolated from the general population. Until further studies are conducted, the role of nonsynthetic cannabinoids for symptom management in patients with CKD should be limited to the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain. Clinicians need to be cognizant that nonsynthetic cannabinoid preparations, particularly smoked cannabis, can pose significant health risks and these must be cautiously weighed against the limited substantiated therapeutic benefits of cannabis in patients with CKD.",

    "abstract": "We investigate factors influencing European winter (DJFM) air temperatures for the period 1979\u20132015 with the focus on changes during the recent period of rapid Arctic warming (1998\u20132015). We employ meteorological reanalyses analysed with a combination of correlation analysis, two pattern clustering techniques, and back\u2010trajectory airmass identification. In all five selected European regions, severe cold winter events lasting at least 4 days are significantly correlated with warm Arctic episodes. Relationships during opposite conditions of warm Europe/cold Arctic are also significant. Correlations have become consistently stronger since 1998. Large\u2010scale pattern analysis reveals that cold spells are associated with the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO\u2010) and the positive phase of the Scandinavian (SCA+) pattern, which in turn are correlated with the divergence of dry\u2010static energy transport. Warm European extremes are associated with opposite phases of these patterns and the convergence of latent heat transport. Airmass trajectory analysis is consistent with these findings, as airmasses associated with extreme cold events typically originate over continents, while warm events tend to occur with prevailing maritime airmasses. Despite Arctic\u2010wide warming, significant cooling has occurred in northeastern Europe owing to a decrease in adiabatic subsidence heating in airmasses arriving from the southeast, along with increased occurrence of circulation patterns favouring low temperature advection. These dynamic effects dominated over the increased mean temperature of most circulation patterns. Lagged correlation analysis reveals that SCA\u2010 and NAO+ are typically preceded by cold Arctic anomalies during the previous 2\u20133 months, which may aid seasonal forecasting. Wintertime associations of warm weather in the Arctic and cold events in Europe have become stronger during the Arctic amplification of climate warming. Although winters have warmed in Europe, significant winter cooling has occurred in northeastern Europe in cases of airmasses originating from southeast. The positive phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation is typically preceded by cold Arctic anomalies during the previous 2\u20133 months, which may aid seasonal forecasting. ",

    "abstract": "The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), with a predominant \u2018youth bulge\u2019 among its 54 million people, has witnessed an exponential increase in research pertinent to child and adolescent mental health (CAMH). Aside from a few narrative reviews, to date, no critical appraisal examining the magnitude of CAMH has emerged from this region. This study aimed to report the prevalence rates of CAMH disorders in the GCC through a systematic review of the existing literature followed by a meta-analysis. A systematic review of the literature from the six GCC countries (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates) was conducted. The databases used included Scopus, ProQuest, Pubmed, and a final check was performed on Google Scholar to account for any remaining studies that may have still been under review. Meta analytic techniques were then used to estimate prevalence rates of each specific mental disorder, i.e. ADHD, depression, anxiety, stress, eating disorders, and tobacco use disorder. A total of 33 studies from the six countries were included. The pooled prevalence of ADHD as per the Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Rating Scale (VADHDDRS) , clinical judgments, Attention Deficit Disorders Evaluation Scale (ADDES), and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was found to be 13.125%, 13.38%, 26.135%, and 12.83%, respectively. The pooled prevalence of depressive symptoms solicited by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS), and Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents (MINI Kid) was 44.684%, 45.09%, and 26.12%, respectively. The pooled prevalence of anxiety according to the DASS and the MINI Kid was 57.04% and 17.27%, respectively, while the pooled prevalence of stress as per the DASS was found to be 43.15%. The pooled prevalence of disordered eating solicited by the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26) was 31.55%. Lastly, the pooled prevalence of tobacco use disorder per the Global Youth Tobacco Survey was 19.39%. To date, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis of its kind from the GCC. The prevalence rate of CAMH disorders appears to be in the upper range of international trends. The higher rates could be attributed to the existing studies using suboptimal methodological approaches and instruments to solicit the presence of CAMH.",

However, only a minority of Saudi Arabian mothers exclusively breastfeed, so the influencing factors must be examined to encourage more to do so. The study aimed to determine the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding at 6 months and its associated factors in Tabuk, North West Saudi Arabia. A total of 589 mothers of healthy infants aged between 6 and 24 months were interviewed while attending Well-Baby Clinics within 5 primary health care centers. Interviews deployed a structured questionnaire to collect sociodemographic information and detailed data concerning breastfeeding practices. A logistic regression analysis was then performed on the data to identify the factors independently associated with exclusive breastfeeding practice for infants at 6 months. Exclusive breastfeeding was practiced by 31.4% of mothers for the first 6 months of their infant\u2019s life. The logistic regressions indicated that exclusive breastfeeding at 6 months was less likely to be practiced by working mothers, Saudi nationals, and for babies born via cesarean delivery or at low birth weights. Conversely, the mother\u2019s awareness of the recommended exclusive breastfeeding duration was positively associated with exclusive breastfeeding. Programs promoting 6 months of exclusive breastfeeding should target high-risk groups. Two factors identified by this study are modifiable: working mothers and mothers\u2019 awareness of the exclusive breastfeeding duration recommendation. Strategies to improve exclusive breastfeeding rates should therefore focus on workplace facilities and increasing awareness of the exclusive breastfeeding recommendation.",

Patients were monitored at the 1 st , 2 nd , 3 rd , and 4 th weeks after surgery for postoperative discomfort (D), consumption of analgesics during first postoperative week, alteration of sensitivity (AS), change in feeding habits (CFH), complete wound epithelialization (CWE), and healing index (Landry et al. 1998). Two patients in the GS group showed significantly early CWE, higher healing index score, and less D, AS, and CFH postoperatively in comparison to the PRF group. It was suggested that GS can also be considered as an effective, economical, and biocompatible dressing material of choice to enhance wound healing and to minimize postoperative complications associated with the donor site.",

    "abstract": "Although gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) compared to normoglycemic pregnancies, the biochemical pathways underlying the progression of GDM to T2DM are not fully elucidated. The purpose of this exploratory study was to utilize metabolomics with an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) to examine the amino acid response in women with prior GDM to determine if a relationship between these metabolites and established risk factors for T2DM exists. Thirty-eight non-pregnant women without diabetes but with prior GDM within the previous 3 years were recruited from a community-based population. A 75\u00a0g-OGTT was administered; fasting and 2-h plasma samples were obtained. Metabolite profiles of 23 amino acids or amino acid derivatives were measured with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Measures of insulin resistance were derived from the OGTT and risk factors for T2DM were obtained by self-report. Twenty-two metabolite levels decreased significantly in response to the OGTT ( p <\u00a00.05). The clinical covariates most powerfully associated with metabolite level changes included race, body mass index (BMI), and duration of prior breastfeeding, (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0SD of standardized \u03b2 -coefficients, \u03b2 =\u00a0\u22120.38\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.05, 0.25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.08, and 0.44\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03, respectively, all p <\u00a00.05). Notably, a prior history of breastfeeding was associated with the greatest number of metabolite changes.

The method has the advantage of recording eating behavior objectively and offers the possibility of changing eating behavior both in experiments and in clinical practice. A limitation may be that experimental subjects are affected by the method. The same limitation may be an advantage in clinical practice, as eating behavior is more easily stabilized by the method.

In this qualitative study, we described the experiences of 20 Iranian breastfeeding mothers through in-depth and semi-structured interviews. All interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. Two main themes emerged as follows: 1) self-management with subthemes of a) attitude reconstruction, b) order and planning, c) creating a boundary between work and family and d) reprioritising life affairs; and 2) seeking help with subthemes of a) family member support, b) childcare facilities and c) spirituality. Findings suggest that women need support from family members and family-friendly policies at the workplace.

Certain factors contribute to the inability of mothers to breastfeed. This investigation explored the effect of maternal occupation on breast feeding amongst females in Al-Hassa in the southeastern region of KSA. This cross-sectional study was conducted by administering a structured Arabic questionnaire to working and non-working mothers in the region. The participants were asked about their job status and whether they were breast feeding (BF), the reasons for reducing or stopping BF, and the health status of their babies. The obtained data were analysed using the chi-square test. A total of 124 mothers participated in the survey; 62 working mother (WM) and 62 non-working women (NWM). All of the NWM had breastfed their babies, while ninety-two percent of the WM breastfed, while the remaining 8% (12.9) of WM did not breastfeed. The results also showed that only 7% of WM practiced exclusive breast feeding (EBF), while 37% of the NWM were found to practice EBF. Maternal occupation was not observed to be a barrier to prevent mothers from breast feeding but affected the duration and frequency of breast feeding per day and the health status of babies.",

The increase of body weight is related to increased food intake in response to mental stress and more time spent at home, increased opportunity to feed, and increased visual and olfactory stimulation to eat, which represents a potential risk of overfeeding nowadays. In this article, we postulate that the unusual lifestyle imposed by the COVID-19 quarantine may induce a circadian misalignment, which is capable to induce alterations on eating and sleep behaviors.",

    "abstract": "Studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have contributed to our understanding of possible neural abnormalities among individuals with eating disorders. Many of these studies have focused on three domains: 1) cognitive control, 2) reward processing, and 3) affective processing. This review attempts to summarize the recent fMRI findings across these domains among the most well-characterized eating disorders: anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge eating disorder (BED). Though the literature is a bit murky, a few major themes have emerged. Cognitive control systems are affected among individuals across eating disorder diagnoses, but effects seem least pronounced in AN. Specifically, individuals with all eating disorders appear to show decreased prefrontal activation during cognitive control, but there is less evidence in AN linking decreased prefrontal activation with behavior. There is some evidence that the reinforcing value of food is reduced in AN, but individuals with BN and BED show hyperactivation to rewarding food-related stimuli, suggesting the reinforcing value of food may be enhanced. However, more complex reward processing paradigms show that individuals with BN and BED exhibit hypoactivation to reward anticipation and provide mixed results with regards to reward receipt. There are fewer neuroimaging findings related to affective processing, yet behavioral findings suggest affective processing is important in understanding eating disorders. Though the extant literature is complicated, these studies represent a foundation from which to build and provide insight into potential neurobiological mechanisms that may contribute to the pathophysiology of eating disorders.",

While the rate of initiation of breastfeeding in the United Kingdom has shown a steady increase in the last 25 years, rates of exclusive breastfeeding in the early weeks and months over the same time period have shown only marginal increases. This study was designed to extend current knowledge around breastfeeding experiences, decisions and behaviours. Qualitative, interpretive phenomenological approach. Data were collected between July 2009\u2013January 2010 through in-depth interviews with 22 women from a city in the East Midlands where the prevalence of breastfeeding has showed a decreasing trend. Data were collected between 3\u20136 months after the birth of their youngest baby. Analysis of data uncovered a key theme: illusions of compliance. The findings revealed that women's breastfeeding behaviours were socially mediated. They adopted a good mother image by conforming to the moral obligation to breastfeed immediately after their babies were born. Those women who struggled to establish breastfeeding tried to hide their difficulties rather than admit that they were not coping. This study provides insights into women's infant feeding decisions and behaviours, building on understandings of \u2018good mothering\u2019 in the wider literature. Importantly we highlight some of the previously unknown strategies that women employed to portray themselves as calm, coping and in control when in reality they were struggling and not enjoying breastfeeding.",

Because nymphs are the caste that develops into alates, the seasonal abundance of nymphs was examined over a 5\u2009yr period. Numbers of workers, soldiers, and soldier/worker ratio were significantly affected by month. Recruitment and retention of foraging termites in stations was significantly affected by the level of feeding damage. The number of nymphs collected in monitoring stations was highly variable. In the 12\u2009mo test, there was a significant correlation between numbers of nymphs and level of feeding damage, temperature, precipitation, and soil composition. Over a 5\u2009yr period, significantly more nymphs were collected in 2011 than in 2007 and 2008. Peak nymph collections varied from year to year. Overall, peak nymph collections were more likely to occur in Mar., Sept., and Oct. Increasing our knowledge of the environmental factors that influence recruitment and retention of foraging termites in monitoring stations could influence termite bait placement and improve baiting strategies for termite control. Identifying the key factors that cause aggregations of nymphs in underground stations could increase our ability to predict the intensity and location of alate swarms.",

The study population consisted of 4695 young people attending recreational sites on weekend nights. The intervention included two questionnaires and two psychoactive substance detection tests performed at the entry and exit of the recreational sites. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to predict the probability of binge drinking. Binge drinking was reported by 20% of the males and 13% of the females (P=0.001) before entry into the recreational sites and by 18% of the males and 11% of the females before entry into the clubs (P<0.001). Poly-drug use was reported by 71% of the males and 66% of the females. Living with a parent (OR 1.57; P=0.01), seeking employment (OR 1.66; P=0.005) and cannabis consumption (several times per month and several times per week, OR 1.94 and 3.66, respectively, P<0.05) were associated with binge drinking.

This study aimed to evaluate the level of self-efficacy of the students attending the Degree Course of Midwifery, regarding the support of mother and child in breastfeeding. A questionnaire of 37 items (Blackmanet al, 2015) validated in Italian by Mazzeo Melchionda (2019), was sent on-line to students of ten different Midwifery Degree Courses to assess their level of self-efficacy regarding the management of breastfeeding. Statistical analysis was carried out using statistic software R3.4.3 (The Foundation for Statistical Computing). 158 questionnaires were collected from ten Italian Midwifery Degree Courses. The areas in which students showed a high level of self-efficacy in managing breastfeeding include: the benefits of breastfeeding; the child\u2019s tendency to take the breast within an hour from childbirth and the relevance of skin to skin contact and rooming-in. Low levels of self-efficacy concerned the comfortably breastfeeding in public places and avoiding giving formula to the baby in its first six weeks of life.

Estimates are that yearly over 3.3 million healthy life years worldwide are lost because of eating disorders. In contrast to other mental disorders, in anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa years lived with disability (YLDs) have increased. Despite treatment advances, mortality rates of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa remain very high: those who have received inpatient treatment for anorexia nervosa still have a more than five times increased mortality risk. Mortality risks for bulimia nervosa, and for anorexia nervosa treated outside the hospital, are lower but still about twice those of controls. In people with an eating disorder, quality of life is reduced, yearly healthcare costs are 48% higher than in the general population, the presence of mental health comorbidity is associated with 48% lower yearly earnings, the number of offspring is reduced, and risks for adverse pregnancy and neonatal outcomes are increased.

The CON group was greater (p<0.05) in rib-eye area, and lighter (p<0.05) red in meat color compared to the TMR group. In the correlation coefficients between blood components of steers and carcass traits, retinol had a negative (p<0.05) correlation with marbling score and rib-eye area. Leptin had a positive (p<0.05) correlation with back fat thickness. Blood cholesterol and triglyceride were positively (p<0.05) correlated with carcass weight and rib-eye area. Growth performance, carcass ribeye area and meat color showed a more desirable result in the CON compared to the TMR in Hanwoo steers. Assessing the accumulated data of carcass traits with blood components including hormones\u2014particularly retinol, cholesterol, triglyceride, and leptin\u2014during the fattening or finishing phases, it may be possible to find a biomarker for determining beef quality in living animals.",

    "abstract": "The nutritional status of children is influenced by feeding practices. Infant and Child Feeding Index (ICFI) is an age-specific composite index to assess the feeding practices of children. To determine the association between ICFI and the nutritional status of children aged 6 to 24 months. To find whether ICFI has value as a tool for detecting poor nutritional status. To determine the association of ICFI and nutritional status with sociodemographic and other factors. A cross-sectional study was conducted in the urban field practice area of a tertiary care institute among 149 children aged 6 to 24 months and their mothers. Data on feeding practices were obtained and ICFI scores were calculated. The weight and length of the children were measured and Z scores (WAZ, LAZ, and WLZ) were calculated. A Chi-square test was used to find the association between the categorical variables. We found no association between ICFI and any of the three nutritional indicators such as WAZ, LAZ, and WLZ. The sensitivity of the ICFI was low for detecting underweight (10.0%), stunting (29.4%), and wasting (11.1%). ICFI was significantly associated with the growth monitoring of children and mothers' education. WAZ was significantly associated with mother's education and socioeconomic class. There is no association between ICFI and the nutritional status of children. ICFI has limited value in detecting the poor nutritional status of children in this urban setting. Maternal education and growth monitoring of children play an important role in infant and child feeding practices.",

This study examined the resting-state functional network connectivity underlying eating disorder symptoms in a large sample of healthy young adults ( n =\u00a0693). Individuals with higher levels of eating disorder symptoms displayed weaker intra-network connectivity of the executive control network and basal ganglia network, as well as weaker inter-network connectivity in the three examined networks (i.e., the executive control network, basal ganglia network, and default mode network).

They further reveal that the less efficient information exchange within and between intrinsic networks associated with self-referential thinking, inhibitory control, and reward sensitivity are strongly related to eating disorder symptoms. Previous neuroimaging research of eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa has mainly focused on clinical patients, indicating the crucial role of intrinsic connectivity networks involved in aberrant behavioral control (i.e., executive control network), reward reactivity (i.e., basal ganglia network), and excessive self-focused and body-focused ruminations (i.e., default mode network) in the onset and maintenance of eating disturbances. However, examinations of large-scale resting-state networks that support the role of cognitive control, reward sensitivity, and self-directed thinking in disordered eating have rarely involved non-clinical samples from the general population. This study, involving a total of 693 healthy young adults (68.69% females; mean age, 18.37\u00a0years), investigated these issues by using pre-defined functional regions of interest from the executive control network, basal ganglia network, default mode network, and a seed-based region of interest-to-region of interest approach. After statistically controlling for differences in age, sex, body mass index, and head motion, we observed significant associations of higher levels of eating disorder symptoms, especially bulimia-type eating (i.e., binge eating and a combination of binge eating and compensatory behaviors, such as purging via self-induced vomiting or laxative use, and compulsive exercise), with weaker intra-network and inter-network functional synchrony. These results remained significant after excluding underweight, overweight, and obese participants. These findings suggest that these neural circuits may play a key role in the symptoms of disordered eating in healthy adults. They further reveal that the less efficient information exchange within and between intrinsic networks associated with self-referential thinking, inhibitory control, and reward sensitivity are strongly related to eating disorder symptoms.",

    "abstract": "Social difficulties in eating disorders can manifest as predisposing traits and premorbid difficulties, and/or as consequences of the illness. The aim of this paper is to briefly review the evidence of social problems in people with eating disorders and to consider the literature on treatments that target these features. Method: A narrative review of the literature was conducted. People with eating disorders often manifest traits, such as shyness, increased tendency to submissiveness and social comparison, and problems with peer relationships before illness onset. Further social difficulties occur as the illness devel-ops, including impaired social cognition and increased threat sensitivity. All relationships with family, peers and therapists are compromised by these effects. Thus, social difficulties are both risk and maintaining factors of eating disorders and are suitable targets for interventions. Several forms of generic treatments (e.g. interpersonal psychotherapy, cognitive analytic therapy, focal psychodynamic therapy) have an interpersonal focus and show some efficacy. Guided self-management based on the cognitive interpersonal model of the illness directed to both individuals and support persons has been found to im-prove outcomes for all parties. Adjunctive treatments that focus on specific social difficulties, such as cognitive remediation and emotion skills training and cognitive bias modification have been shown to have a promising role. More work is needed to establish whether these approaches can improve on the rather disappointing outcomes that are attained by currently used treatments for eating disorders",

Twenty\u2010five studies were included and were analysed in relation to diagnosis, comorbidity, and treatment outcome. Despite the central role of overvaluation of body shape and weight and cognitive restraint across ED diagnoses, ineffectiveness, interoceptive awareness and affective problems appear central symptoms.

Although few studies assessed treatment outcome, there is evidence supporting the predictive role of central network nodes. Ineffectiveness, interoceptive ability and affective problems may be included in the core ED psychopathology, in addition to ED\u2010specific symptoms. Network analysis is a promising method to reconceptualize comorbidity. Future studies are recommended to include general psychopathology in ED networks, to assess connections with the external field and clinical meaning of network connectivity.

We summarized PMI\u2019s preclinical and clinical data on the effects of switching from cigarette smoking to THS. Data from four preclinical mouse and rat studies showed that, upon either cessation of cigarette smoke exposure or switching to THS exposure, the upregulation of CYP1A2 observed with exposure to cigarette smoke reverted close to fresh-air levels. Data from four clinical studies yielded similar results on CYP1A2 activity within a time frame of five days. Furthermore, the effects of switching to THS were similar to those seen after smoking cessation. Because smoking cessation and switching to either electronic cigarettes or THS seem to have similar effects on CYP1A2 activity, the same measures taken for patients treated with narrow therapeutic index drugs that are metabolized by CYP1A2 and who quit smoking should be recommended for those switching to RRPs.",

Alterations in attentional processing have been observed in various binge behaviors. We synthesize results from event-related potentials to incentive stimuli. P300 and LPP amplitudes are consistently enlarged across studies. The findings are in line with incentive sensitization. Binge behavior not only refers to the consumption of substances such as alcohol or food, but is also used in relation to gaming, watching and gambling. Dependent on context it makes for a widespread, benign recreational activity or can pose a serious mental health problem with deleterious consequences. Incentive sensitization theory describes the attribution of salience towards stimuli strongly associated with dopamine-mediated reward as a result of repeated consumption. The sensitized neural networks cause cue-triggered craving and excessive desire, but thus, this mechanism may also be applicable to stimulus-induced behaviors not associated with classical withdrawal symptoms. Event-related potentials (ERP) are a useful method of examining motivated attention towards incentive stimuli. This mini review aims to synthesize ERP findings from different types of binge behaviors in order to compare cue-reactivity to incentive stimuli. Studies investigating binge drinking, binge eating as well as binge watching, gaming and gambling were screened. To limit the influence of concurrent task demands, ERP studies applying picture viewing paradigms with incentive stimuli were selected. Across binge behaviors, evidence on altered mid-latency ERPs has been mixed. However, studies investigating later stages of attentional processes more consistently find enlarged P300 and late positive potentials (LPP) amplitudes to relevant cues. An altered attentional processing of incentive stimuli reflecting motivated attention is in line with incentive sensitization theory. Considering the limited number of studies, especially regarding binge behaviors not involving substances, more research is needed to attain a more thorough understanding of incentive sensitization across binge behaviors.",

A cross-sectional study through a telephone interview was conducted at Hamad Medical Corporation, the only tertiary care and accredited academic institution in the State of Qatar. Mothers of children born between the period of January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2012 in the State of Qatar were contacted. Of the total 840 mothers who were contacted for the telephone survey, 453 mothers agreed to be interviewed (response rate 53.9%), while 364 (43.3%) did not answer the phone, and 21 (2.5%) answered the phone but refused to participate in the study. The overall breastfeeding initiation rate among the mothers was 96.2%, with 3.8% mothers reporting that they had never breastfed their baby. The percentage of mothers who exclusively breastfed their children in the first 6 months was 24.3%. The most common barriers to breastfeeding as perceived by our participants were the following: perception of lack of sufficient breast milk after delivery (44%), formula is easy to use and more available soon after birth (17.8%), mom had to return to work (16.3%), lack of adequate knowledge about breastfeeding (6.5%), and the concept that the infant did not tolerate breast milk (4.9%). Exclusive breastfeeding barriers as perceived by women residing in the State of Qatar, a wealthy rapidly developing country, do not differ much from those in other nations. What varies are the tremendous medical resources and the easy and comfortable access to health care in our community. We plan to implement a nationwide campaign to establish a prenatal breastfeeding counseling visit for all expecting mothers.",

Recent insight in molecular genetics, treatment strategies, risk factors and outcomes associated with hypothalamic obesity provide novel therapeutic perspectives. This review includes relevant publications since 2013. Recent findings confirm that alterations in posterior hypothalamic areas because of tumour location and/or treatment-related injuries are associated with severe hypothalamic obesity, reduced overall survival and impaired quality of life in long-term survivors of childhood-onset craniopharyngioma. However, eating disorders are observed because of hypothalamic obesity without clear disease-specific patterns. Treatment options for hypothalamic obesity are very limited. Treatment with invasive, nonreversible bariatric methods such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is most efficient in weight reduction, but controversial in the paediatric population because of medical, ethical, and legal considerations. Accordingly, treatment in craniopharyngioma should focus on prevention of (further) hypothalamic injury. Presurgical imaging for grading of hypothalamic involvement should be the basis for hypothalamus-sparing strategies conducted by experienced multidisciplinary teams. Until a nonsurgical therapeutic option for hypothalamic obesity for paediatric patients is found, prevention of hypothalamic injury should be the preferred treatment strategy, conducted exclusively by experienced multidisciplinary teams.",

The study included women \u226450 years of age with an IUD insertion. Site-specific algorithms using structured and unstructured data were developed and a sample validated by EHR review. Positive predictive values (PPVs) of the algorithms were calculated. Breastfeeding status was assessed in a random sample of 125 women at each research site with IUD placement within 52 weeks postpartum. The study population included 282,028 women with 325,582 IUD insertions. The PPVs for uterine perforation were KPNC 77%, KPSC 81%, KPWA 82%, and RI 47%; PPVs for IUD expulsion were KPNC 77%, KPSC 87%, KPWA 68%, and RI 37%. Across all research sites, breastfeeding status at the time of IUD insertion was determined for 94% of those sampled.

A total of 511 participants, including gambling disorder (GD) and eating disorder (ED) patients diagnosed according to DSM-5 criteria, as well as healthy controls (HCs), took part in the study. Higher PB prevalence was obtained in ED patients than in the other two study groups (ED 12.5% vs. 1.3% HC and 2.7% GD). Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) verified the 13-item structure of the PBS, and indexes of convergent and discriminant capacity were estimated. CFA confirmed the structure in two factors (excessive buying behavior and loss of control) with excellent internal consistency (\u03b1\u2009=\u2009.92 and .86, respectively) . Good convergent capacity was obtained with external psychopathology and personality measures (positive correlations with novelty seeking and negative associations with self-directedness and harm avoidance were found). Good discriminative capacity to differentiate between the study groups was obtained. This study provides support for the reliability and validity of the Spanish adaptation of the PBS.

    "abstract": "It is increasingly recognized that women who have just given birth have a high unmet need and require contraceptive protection in the first year postpartum. A majority of women in developing countries do breastfeed exclusively but for short durations, hence they may be sometimes unknowingly exposed to the risk of pregnancy if they are relying on nursing for contraceptive protection. The WHO\u2019s Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use recommends the use of different contraceptives in the first year postpartum depending on whether the woman is nursing or not and the time since delivery. Some of the options available for breastfeeding women include implants, IUDs and injectables, which can be obtained only from a trained family planning provider. Since 2013, Population Council has been carrying out a study in Senegal, Nigeria, and Kenya to assess the acceptability of progesterone vaginal ring (PVR) as a new contraceptive option designed specifically for use by breastfeeding women to extend the period of lactational amenorrhea and promote birth spacing. Breastfeeding in sub-Saharan Africa is near universal with fairly long durations, a situation that increases the effectiveness of PVR. Each ring delivers a daily dose of 10 mg of progesterone and can be used continuously up to 3 months with a woman being able to continue with its use up to 1 year (four rings used consecutively). Preliminary results indicate that many women who had used the method found it acceptable and their partners supported its use. Activities aimed at having PVR registered and made available in focal countries are ongoing. Integration of family planning and immunization services for mothers and their newborns will be a key strategy in introducing PVR into targeted health care markets. Given that the use of PVR does not require extensive clinical training, it will be easier to integrate it at all levels of the health system from tertiary health facilities to community-based services. The PVR has been recently included in the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines and the WHO\u2019s fifth edition of the Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use which should facilitate its introduction into the public and private sectors.",

    "abstract": "Stunting is caused by chronic malnutrition and recurrent infectious diseases. Stunting in Pasongsongan Village affects less than 20% of the children under two, leading to problems in growth in early childhood. Ocean fish is the main animal products in this village on the coast, but it turned out that it is not served to the children, even if they should have begun to be introduced to animal products by the age of 9 months. The purpose of this study was to observe the practices of complementary feeding among stunted children under the age of two in Pasongsongan Village. This research was carried out by qualitative method. The informants were twelve mothers of children under the age of two. Data was collected from interviews, observations and documentation. The stunted children only consumed rice porridge until the age of one, which means that the food intake contains mostly carbohydrates. The mothers who have stunted children have argued that the children\u2019s intestines is not strong enough to digest food with coarser texture like eggs, fish, beef and chicken. Sea fish are given when the children can walk because there has long been a belief that fish contain worms. No feeding fishes and other animal products that are good source of protein can affect their growth in a negative way. The feeding practice of stunted children under the age of two in Pasongsongan Village was strongly influenced by culture. The mindsets of mothers of the stunted children regarding feeding practices must be changed.",

    "abstract": "Universal salt iodization (USI) is the most feasible and cost-effective, and equitable, approach to prevent iodine deficiency. Severe maternal iodine deficiency during pregnancy is associated with serious adverse gestational and birth outcomes. The aim was to assess iodine status and identify independent factors associated with urinary iodine concentration (UIC) among women of reproductive age in Tanzania. This was a weighted, population-based, cross-sectional study in 2985 women of reproductive age (20\u201349 y) in Tanzania who participated in the Demographic and Health Surveys in 2015\u20132016 (DHS 2015\u20132016) and had measured UIC. Multivariable generalized linear regression was used to identify potential factors that were associated with UIC. The median UICs among women consuming inadequately iodized salt (93.6\u00a0\u03bcg/L; 25th and 75th percentiles: 43.1, 197.9 \u03bcg/L) and women in the lowest socioeconomic status (92.3\u00a0\u03bcg/L; 45.6, 194.4 \u03bcg/L) were below the WHO-recommended ranges (\u2265150\u00a0\u03bcg/L for pregnant women and \u2265100\u00a0\u03bcg/L for nonpregnant women). The results of multivariable models indicated that pregnant women had 1.21\u00a0\u03bcg/L lower UIC than nonpregnant women (\u03b2 = \u22121.21; 95% CI: \u22123.42, \u22120.12), breastfeeding women had 1.02\u00a0\u03bcg/L lower UIC than nonbreastfeeding women (\u03b2 = \u22121.02; 95% CI: \u22122.25, \u22120.27), and women with no education had a 1.88 \u03bcg/L lower UIC compared with those with secondary/highest education (\u03b2 = \u22121.88; 95% CI: \u22124.58, \u22120.36). Women consuming inadequately iodized salt had 6.55\u00a0\u03bcg/L lower UIC than those consuming adequately iodized salt (\u03b2 = \u22126.55; 95% CI: \u22129.24, \u22124.33). The median UIC varied substantially across geographic zones, ranging from 83.2\u00a0\u03bcg/L (45.9, 165.3) in the Western region to 347.8\u00a0\u03bcg/L (185.0, 479.8) in the Eastern region. Our findings indicated a great heterogeneity in median UIC across regions of Tanzania among women of reproductive age. Poverty, consuming inadequately iodized salt, and lack of education appeared to be the driving factors for lower UIC in Tanzania. There is a great heterogeneity in median urinary iodine concentration (UIC) across regions of Tanzania. Poverty and consuming inadequately iodized salt appear to be the driving factors for lower UIC in Tanzania.",

The objective of this study was to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and practices of breastfeeding and to assess factors associated with breastfeeding practices among postnatal mothers delivering in Garhwal region of Uttarakhand, India. A cross-sectional study was conducted from March 2018 to August 2018 among postpartum mothers who were selected through convenient nonrandom sampling. A semi-structured questionnaire including the participants' data, knowledge, attitude, and practices was used. A total of 361 postnatal mothers participated in the study. 88.92% knew that breastfeeding should be continued for 6 months after birth and almost 64.81% initiated breastfeeding within 1 h of birth. 26.59% of the women discarded colostrum. 16.35% of the mothers gave prelacteal feeds, with formula milk being the most common prelacteal feed. 82.82% of the mothers did not receive breastfeeding counseling during antenatal visits. Multiparous women, those undergoing vaginal delivery (VD), and those living in joint family were more likely to initiate breastfeeding within 1 h of birth as compared to primiparous women, those undergoing cesarean section, and those living with nuclear families ( P < 0.05). A significant difference was also noted in terms of giving prelacteal feeds in those undergoing cesarean section as compared to VD (23.71% vs. 13.63%, P = 0.0217). This study revealed that the rate of early initiation of breastfeeding is still low.",

    "abstract": "The relationship between pain and overweight/obesity is bidirectional \u2013 excess weight can cause pain, yet eating food high in calories, fat and sugar has been shown to alleviate pain. It appears likely that overweight/obese individuals may turn to these types of foods when they experience pain, leading to weight gain; however, this phenomenon has not been examined to date. The authors of this study set out to elucidate the relationship between pain and food intake in obese and overweight patients with osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis (OA) patients who are overweight or obese report higher levels of pain compared with their normal-weight OA counterparts. Evidence suggests that overweight or obese OA patients also experience pain relief from eating foods high in calories, fat or sugar. Eating to alleviate pain may be problematic because it can lead to additional weight gain, which may contribute to heightened pain. To investigate the relationship between pain and food intake using ecological momentary assessments in a sample of 71 over-weight and obese OA patients. Participants completed two consecutive days of diary entries in which they recorded their levels of pain, mood and food intake throughout the day. Data were analyzed using generalized estimating equations that modelled pain as a predictor of calorie, fat and sugar intake. All models were adjusted for sex, body mass index, negative mood, time and treatment history. Pain significantly predicted calorie (Z=2.57; P=0.01) and fat intake (Z=1.99; P=0.05). Using ecological momentary assessments as a novel approach, the present study provides preliminary data supporting a relationship between pain and food intake among overweight and obese OA patients. Continued advances in our understanding of the relationship between pain and eating behaviour may help to optimize intervention strategies for these patients.",

A cross-sectional study of 497 Vietnamese aged 19 to 60 years (204 males, 293 females) was conducted in rural areas of Haiphong, Vietnam. The subjects were classified as underweight, normal weight, and overweight based on BMI. General characteristics, anthropometric parameters, blood profiles, and eating habits were obtained and dietary intake was assessed using 24-hour recalls for 2 consecutive days. A high prevalence of both underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m 2 ) and overweight (BMI \u2265 23 kg/m 2 ) individuals was observed (14.2% and 21.6% for males and 18.9% and 20.6% for females, respectively). For both genders, the overweight group were older than the under- and normal weight groups ( P = 0.0118 for males and P = 0.0002 for females). In female subjects, the overweight group consumed significantly less cereals ( P = 0.0033), energy ( P = 0.0046), protein ( P = 0.0222), and carbohydrate ( P = 0.0017) and more fruits ( P = 0.0026) than the underweight group; however, no such differences existed in males. The overweight subjects overate more frequently ( P = 0.0295) and consumed fish ( P = 0.0096) and fruits ( P = 0.0083) more often. The prevalence of both underweight and overweight individuals pose serious public health problems in the rural areas of Vietnamese and the overweight group was related to overeating and high fish and fruit consumption. These findings may provide basic data for policymakers and dieticians in order to develop future nutrition and health programs for rural populations in Vietnam.",

We compared nutritional adequacy according to living status and the frequency of eating out-of-home foods in young Japanese women. Female dietetic students (aged 18\u201320 years; n\u00a0=\u00a04,017) participated in a cross-sectional multicenter study, which was conducted in 85 dietetic schools in 35 of 47 prefectures in Japan. Habitual dietary intake was assessed with a validated diet history questionnaire. Nutritional adequacy was determined based on the Dietary Reference Intakes for Japanese, 2015, for two goals: preventing non-communicable chronic disease (a tentative dietary goal for preventing lifestyle-related diseases [DG] that tracks five nutrients) and avoiding insufficient intake of mainly vitamins and minerals (estimated average requirement [EAR] that tracks 14 nutrients). Women living with their family were less likely to meet DG nutrient levels, but more likely to meet EAR nutrient levels compared with those living alone. In contrast, women living alone had more inadequate nutrients with EAR and fewer nutrients with not-meeting DG than those living with families. A higher frequency of eating out-of-home was significantly associated with a higher prevalence of not-meeting DG nutrient levels only in the women living with their family. The prevalence of nutritional adequacy varied based on living status. In addition, women living with their family and those with a high frequency of eating out-of-home foods had the highest prevalence of not-meeting DG. Effective ways of improving dietary quality among young Japanese women differ by living status. \u2022 Young women living with their family had more nutrients not meeting dietary goals. \u2022 Eating out was associated with not meeting dietary goals in those living with family. \u2022 Young women living alone had more inadequate intakes of nutrients. \u2022 Eating out-of-home did not affect nutritional adequacy in those living alone.

    "abstract": "Conditioned taste aversion (CTA) can be classically conditioned in the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis and subsequently be consolidated into long-term memory (LTM). The neural trace that subserves CTA-LTM can be summarized as follows: A polysynaptic inhibitory postsynaptic potential recorded in the neuron 1 medial (N1M) cell in the conditioned snails as a result of activation of the cerebral giant cell (CGC) is larger and lasts longer than that in control snails. The N1M cell is ultimately activated by the CGC via the neuron 3 tonic (N3t) cell. That is, the inhibitory monosynaptic inputs from the N3t cell to the N1M cell are facilitated. The N1M and N3t cells are the members of feeding central pattern generator, whereas the CGC is a multimodal interneuron thought to play a key role in feeding behavior. Here we examined the involvement of a second messenger, cAMP, in the establishment of the memory trace. We injected cAMP into the CGC and monitored the potentials of the B3 motor neuron activated by the CGC. B3 activity is used as an index for the synaptic inputs from the N3t cell to the N1M cell. We found that the B3 potentials were transiently enlarged. Thus, when the cAMP concentration is increased in the CGC by taste aversion training, cAMP-induced changes may play a key role in the establishment of a memory trace in the N3t cell.",

    "abstract": "Epidemiological evidence indicates that breastfeeding provides protection against development of overweight/obesity. Nonetheless, a small subgroup of infants undergo excessive weight gain during exclusive breastfeeding, a phenomenon that remains unexplained. Breast milk contains both gut-seeding microbes and substrates for microbial growth in the gut of infants, and a large body of evidence suggests a role for gut microbes in host metabolism. Based on the recently established SKOT III cohort, we investigated the role of the infant gut microbiota in excessive infant weight gain during breastfeeding, including 30 exclusively breastfed infants, 13 of which exhibited excessive weight gain and 17 controls which exhibited normal weight gain during infancy. Infants undergoing excessive weight gain during breastfeeding had a reduced abundance of gut Enterococcus as compared with that observed in the controls. Within the complete cohort, Enterococcus abundance correlated inversely with age/gender-adjusted body-weight, body-mass index and waist circumference, body fat and levels of plasma leptin. The reduced abundance of Enterococcus in infants with excessive weight gain was coupled to a lower content of Enterococcus in breast milk samples of their mothers than seen for mothers in the control group. Together, this suggests that lack of breast milk-derived gut-seeding Enterococci may contribute to excessive weight gain in breastfed infants. The reported findings suggest that lack of seeding with Enterococci from breastmilk into the infant gut influences the unusual development of excessive weight gain in breastfed infants.",

Adolescent screening instruments exist for several behavioral addictions including gambling and video gaming addiction but not for exercise addiction. Given recent empirical and clinical evidence that a minority of teenagers appear to be experiencing exercise addiction, a psychometrically robust screening instrument is required. The aim of this study was to develop and test the psychometric properties of a youth version of the Exercise Addiction Inventory (EAI) \u2013 a robust screening instrument that has been used across different countries and cultures \u2013 and to assess the prevalence of exercise addiction and associated disturbed eating.

A youth version of the EAI (EAI-Y) was developed and distributed. Participants were also screened for disordered eating with the SCOFF Questionnaire. Overall, the EAI-Y demonstrated good reliability and construct validity. The prevalence rate of exercise addiction was 4.0% in school athletes, 8.7% in fitness attendees, and 21% in patients with eating disorders.

Activity-based anorexia (ABA), which refers to the weight loss, hypophagia, and hyperactivity exhibited by rodents exposed to both running wheels and scheduled fasting, provides a model for aspects of AN. Increased dopamine D2/D3 receptor binding in the anteroventral striatum has been reported in AN patients. We virally overexpressed D2Rs on nucleus accumbens core (D2R-OE Nac ) neurons that endogenously express D2Rs, and tested mice of both sexes in the open field test, ABA paradigm, and intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IGTT). D2R-OE Nac did not alter baseline body weight, but increased locomotor activity in the open field across both sexes. During constant access to food and running wheels, D2R-OE Nac mice of both sexes increased food intake and ran more than controls. However, when food was available only 7 hours a day, only female D2R-OE Nac mice rapidly lost 25% of their initial body weight, reduced food intake, and substantially increased wheel running. Surprisingly, female D2R-OE Nac mice also rapidly lost 25% of their initial body weight during scheduled fasting without wheel access and showed no changes in food intake. In contrast, male D2R-OE Nac mice maintained body weight during scheduled fasting. D2R-OE Nac mice of both sexes also showed glucose intolerance in the IGTT. In conclusion, D2R-OE Nac alters glucose metabolism in both sexes but drives robust weight loss only in females during scheduled fasting, implicating metabolic mechanisms in this sexually dimorphic effect.",

The factors related to oral feeding intolerance are not well studied. We aimed to determine the incidence and risk factors of oral feeding intolerance in acute pancreatitis. Patients were prospectively enrolled in the Acute Pancreatitis Patient Registry to Examine Novel Therapies in Clinical Experience, an international acute pancreatitis registry, between 2015 and 2018. Oral feeding intolerance was defined as worsening abdominal pain and/or vomiting after resumption of oral diet. The timing of the initial feeding attempt was stratified based on the day of hospitalization. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to assess for independent risk factors/predictors of oral feeding intolerance. Of 1233 acute pancreatitis patients included in the study, 160 (13%) experienced oral feeding intolerance. The incidence of oral feeding intolerance was similar irrespective of the timing of the initial feeding attempt relative to hospital admission day ( p =\u00a00.41). Patients with oral feeding intolerance were more likely to be younger (45 vs. 50\u00a0years of age), men (61% vs. 49%), and active alcohol users (44% vs. 36%). They also had higher blood urea nitrogen (20 vs. 15\u00a0mg/dl; p <\u00a00.001) and hematocrit levels (41.7% vs. 40.5%; p =\u00a00.017) on admission; were more likely to have a nonbiliary acute pancreatitis etiology (69% vs. 51%), systemic inflammatory response syndrome of 2 or greater on admission (49% vs. 35%) and at 48\u00a0h (50% vs. 26%), develop pancreatic necrosis (29% vs. 13%), moderate to severe acute pancreatitis (41% vs. 24%), and have a longer hospital stay (10 vs. 6\u00a0days; all p <\u00a00.04). The adjusted analysis showed that systemic inflammatory response syndrome of 2 or greater at 48\u00a0h (odds ratio 3.10; 95% confidence interval 1.83\u20135.25) and a nonbiliary acute pancreatitis etiology (odds ratio 1.65; 95% confidence interval 1.01\u20132.69) were independent risk factors for oral feeding intolerance. Oral feeding intolerance occurs in 13% of acute pancreatitis patients and is independently associated with systemic inflammatory response syndrome at 48\u00a0h and a nonbiliary etiology. Current knowledge on this subject  Oral feeding intolerance is a relatively common complication of acute pancreatitis. Oral feeding intolerance results in longer hospitalization and frequent readmissions.  Oral feeding intolerance is a relatively common complication of acute pancreatitis.

Growth rates close to calculated rates were obtained with the diets used. Weekly blood samples were collected from the jugular vein for analysis of glucose, insulin, cortisol, total serum protein, urea, cholesterol and nonesterified fatty acids. During week 5, insulin sensitivity was estimated using the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp technique. Insulin sensitivity did not differ between the groups, but the plasma glucose levels were higher during weeks 3 and 4 for the HI group compared to the LO group. It may be concluded that the amount of concentrate in the diet was too low to induce changes in either the basal plasma insulin levels or the insulin sensitivity in the HI group.",

    "abstract": "Eating-out among Korean people has become an important part of modern lifestyle due to tremendous growth of the food service industry and various social and economic changes. This study examined trends in meal patterns and meal sources while eating-out among Korean adults aged 19 years and older. Data were from the 1998-2012 KNHNES (Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey) by the 24-hour dietary recall method. This study included 55,718 adults aged 19 years and older. For analysis of eating-out frequency, data were categorized by source of meals and serving place. Average frequency of meals consumed away from home increased from 1998 to 2012, although it remained lower than that of meals at home. In addition, male, unmarried, employed, higher educated, and high income individuals more frequently consumed meals away from home. Moreover, sodium intake while eating-out significantly increased from 2,370 mg in 1998 to 2,935 mg in 2012. Lastly, percentage contributions of daily total protein intake, fat intake, and sodium intake from eating-out increased to more than half (53-55%) in 2012 compared with 47-48% in 1998. As eating-out has grown in popularity, greater recognition of public health and nutritional education aimed at promoting healthy food choices is needed. In addition to developing consumer education for overall healthier eating patterns, individuals who are younger, unmarried, higher educated, and males are especially at risk and require attention.",

The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of complementary feeding practices among children aged 6\u201323 months and its association with various sociodemographic factors. The study was a community-based, cross-sectional study conducted at field practice area of Urban Health Training Centre and Rural Health Training Centre, Department of Community Medicine, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Aligarh Muslim University, Aligarh. Mothers of children aged 6\u201323 months of age interviewed using the infant and young child feeding questionnaire for complimentary feeding indicators, namely, minimum dietary diversity (MDD), minimum meal frequency (MMF), and minimum acceptable diet (MAD). The sample size drawn was 326 using systematic random sampling with probability proportionate to size. Wald's statistics, bivariate and multivariate logistic regression. MDD was adequate in 42.6% children, MMF in 50.9% children, and MAD in 35.6% children. MDD was significantly associated with area of residence, birth order of child, and Standard of living index (SLI); MMF was significantly associated with area of residence, sex of child, and literacy status of mother; MAD was significantly associated with area of residence, sex of child, birth order of child, and SLI. The study revealed that approximately 50% of mothers practiced inadequate complementary feeding. The feeding practices were found to be significantly associated with various sociodemographic factors highlighting the importance of addressing these factors if we aim an improvement in feeding practices.",

    "abstract": "Anorexia is a common symptom among cancer patients and contributes to malnutrition and strongly impinges on quality of life. Cancer-induced anorexia is thought to be caused by an inability of food intake-regulating systems in the hypothalamus to respond adequately to negative energy balance during tumour growth. Here, we show that this impaired response of food-intake control is likely to be mediated by altered serotonin signalling and by failure in post-transcriptional neuropeptide Y (NPY) regulation. Two tumour cachectic mouse models with different food intake behaviours were used: a C26-colon adenocarcinoma model with increased food intake and a Lewis lung carcinoma model with decreased food intake. This contrast in food intake behaviour between tumour-bearing (TB) mice in response to growth of the two different tumours was used to distinguish between processes involved in cachexia and mechanisms that might be important in food intake regulation. The hypothalamus was used for transcriptomics (affymetrix chips). In both models, hypothalamic expression of orexigenic NPY was significantly higher compared with controls, suggesting that this change does not directly reflect food intake status but might be linked to negative energy balance in cachexia. Expression of genes involved in serotonin signalling showed to be different between C26-TB mice and Lewis lung carcinoma-TB mice and was inversely associated with food intake. In vitro , using hypothalamic cell lines, serotonin repressed neuronal hypothalamic NPY secretion while not affecting messenger NPY expression, suggesting that serotonin signalling can interfere with NPY synthesis, transport, or secretion. Altered serotonin signalling is associated with changes in food intake behaviour in cachectic TB mice. Serotonins' inhibitory effect on food intake under cancer cachectic conditions is probably via affecting the NPY system. Therefore, serotonin regulation might be a therapeutic target to prevent the development of cancer-induced eating disorders.",

    "abstract": "High prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency is reported among healthy infants, children and adolescents. Maternal Vitamin-D deficiency, poor vitamin-D content of breast milk even in Vitamin-D replete mothers, exclusive breastfeeding without Vitamin-D supplementation and inadequate sunlight exposure are important risk factors for Vitamin D deficiency in infants. To determine the prevalence of hypovitaminosis-D and its relation with breast feeding and childhood illness among healthy infants at 1 year of age. A prospective cohort study was conducted among the infants in an urban community in south India. A total of 495 children were followed up at 1 year of age. Clinical history, anthropometric measurements, and serum blood samples for vitamin-D were obtained. The effects of breastfeeding duration and infections on Vitamin-D status were assessed by univariate and multivariate analysis. The prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency was 22% in these infants. Univariate analysis showed risk of hypovitaminosis-D in children breast fed for more than 6 months ( p 0.02); however, multivariate analysis did not prove an association. Other risk factors analysed were not significantly associated with Hypovitaminosis D. The prevalence of hypovitaminosis-D in this study was low compared to previous studies from India. This study emphasizes the issue of hypovitaminosis-D in otherwise normal children. Routine Vitamin-D supplementation for antenatal women and infants may be needed to overcome this public health problem.",

Steers were stratified by initial BW across five pens and randomly assigned to one of four dietary treatments to supply an average of 626, 906, 1,209, and 1,444 g MP/d ( n = 33 per treatment). Feed intake and feeding behavior were measured using radio frequency identification tags and the Insentec feeding system. For feeding behavior, a visit was defined as each time the Insentec system detected a steer at the feed bunk. A meal was defined as eating periods by intervals no longer than 7 min. Steers were fed until they reached an average BW of 598 \u00b1 3.1 kg. Average daily gain (ADG) responded quadratically ( P < 0.01) with ADG increasing in steers fed 906 g MP/d and plateauing thereafter. Dry-matter intake (DMI; kg) responded quadratically ( P = 0.009) with DMI increasing with MP intake up to 1,209 g/d MP and decreasing thereafter. Gain to feed ratio (G:F) increased linearly ( P = 0.04) and tended ( P = 0.10) to respond quadratically, as G:F increased up to 906 g MP/d and plateaued thereafter. A quadratic response ( P = 0.04 and P = 0.02, respectively) was observed for marbling score and 12th rib subcutaneous fat thickness with steers fed 1,209 g MP/d having the greatest marbling score and back fat thickness. A quadratic effect for visits and meals per day was observed ( P < 0.01) with steers fed the 1,209 g MP/d treatment having the least visits and meals per day. In addition, time eating per visit responded quadratically ( P = 0.05) with time increasing from 626 to 906 g MP/d. There was a linear increase ( P \u2264 0.02) in time eating per meal and per day with increasing MP intake. A quadratic effect ( P < 0.03) was observed for DMI per visit, meal, and minute with steers fed 1,209 g MP/d having the greatest DMI. In summary, steers fed 626 g MP/d had increased visits and meals per day. However, DMI per visit, meal, and minute were greater in steers fed 1,209 g MP/d. A day \u00d7 treatment interaction ( P < 0.001) was observed for plasma urea N as concentrations increased to a greater extent over time in the higher MP treatments than in the lower MP treatments. These data indicate that MP supply (from deficient to excess) influences growth performance, carcass characteristics, and feeding behavior of finishing steers.",

Disadvantaged men aged 25\u201344\u2009years who had \u22652 episodes of binge drinking (\u22658 units in one session) in the preceding month were recruited. Two recruitment strategies were assessed: recruitment from general practice registers and by a community outreach strategy. Theoretically and empirically based text messages were tailored to the target group. The study recruited 67 disadvantaged men at high risk of alcohol\u2010related harm, exceeding the target of 60. Evaluation showed that 95% of text messages were delivered, and the men engaged enthusiastically with the intervention. Retention at follow up was 96%. Outcomes were successfully measured on all men followed up. This provided data for the sample size calculation for the full trial. Post\u2010study evaluation showed high levels of satisfaction with the study. This study has shown that disadvantaged men can be recruited and follow\u2010up data obtained in an alcohol intervention study. The study methods were acceptable to the participants.

    "abstract": "In India, child malnutrition is mostly the result of high levels of exposure to infection and inappropriate infant and young child feeding and caring practices and has its origins almost entirely during the first 2 to 3 years of life. This study aims in assessing the impact of breast feeding on child development of children at 3 years. About 530 children at 3 years were assessed for developmental delay by Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ). Growth measurements and hemoglobin estimation were carried out at the time of developmental evaluation. Physical growth was assessed by using World Health Organization growth charts. Children were assessed for their duration of breast feeding and weaning period. They were analyzed for the feeding practices versus developmental outcome. Chi-square test was used to compare the categorical variables. Differences were considered significant at P < 0.05 level. Children who were exclusively breastfed for at least 6 or more months had significantly higher ASQ scores with P value for communication (0.003), gross motor (0.004), fine motor (0.007) and problem solving (0.013) except personal social (0.059) compared with children who had exclusively breastfed for less than 6 months. Children, who were weaned beyond 12 th month, had significantly higher ASQ scores with P value for communication (0.004), gross motor (0.091), fine motor (0.044), problem solving (0.001) and personal social (0.012) as against those who were weaned at 6 th month or earlier in all domains. Breast feeding has a positive effect on the overall development of the child and should be promoted in the present generation. In India, child malnutrition is responsible for a higher percentage of the country's burden of disease. Undernutrition also affects cognitive and motor development and undermines educational attainment; and ultimately impacts on productivity at work and at home, with adverse implications for income and economic growth.",

    "abstract": "Urethral catheters are placed with nonindwelling intent chiefly for clean intermittent catheterization (CIC), imaging, or collection of a urine sample. Catheter knotting can be a troublesome complication, especially when it occurs in children often resulting in interventions under anesthesia in the operating room. Three children (4 years male, 4 years female, and 6 years male) presented with knotted feeding tubes placed for CIC. Details of these and an additional 31 patients are discussed in a short review. Knotting occurred almost exclusively in children (33/34, 97%), was more common in boys (22/34, 65%) and most often involved a feeding tube (27/34, 79%) with knotting in the bladder (28/34, 82%). Insertion length, caliber and stiffness of catheter, technique, and patient factors are important factors. Avoiding excessive insertion and use of an appropriate size of catheter (that is not too small) may reduce the risk. Manipulation alone (12/34, 35%), with guidewire (5/34, 15%), or with dilatation (3/34, 9%) is most often successful and is best accomplished under general anesthesia. Endourology (7/34, 21%), laparoscopy (1/34, 3%), or an incision (5/34, 15%) may be necessary in some patients. Safeguarding urethral integrity is the overarching concern.",

The KHEI scores were calculated using the food frequency questionnaire data. Survey logistic regression analyses were performed to analyze the association between psychiatric distress and dietary quality. The percentage of subjects with experience of depressive mood, higher stress perception, and suicidal ideation was 8.2%, 25.0%, and 3.7% in men and 15.4%, 27.3%, and 6.0% in women, respectively. The mean KHEI score was 61.5 \u00b1 0.29 in men and 64.8 \u00b1 0.24 in women ( P < 0.001). The present study found a difference in the adherence to specific dietary components of the KHEI between sexes. Men experiencing depressive symptoms were less likely to eat meat, fish, eggs, and beans, while depressed women showed lower vegetable intake. Both men and women with suicidal ideation showed a lower intake of vegetables. The men with stress had a lower breakfast eating score than those without stress (7.21 vs. 6.77, P = 0.016). The multivariate-adjusted odds ratios for depressive symptoms, stress perception, and the suicidal idea in women with the highest quartile of KHEI scores compared to the lowest quartile was 0.69 (95% confidence interval, 0.51\u20130.92), 0.73 (0.58\u20130.82), and 0.52 (0.33\u20130.82), respectively and significant dose-response associations were observed ( P for trends < 0.05 for all).

About half of newly delivered mothers have reported a traumatic childbirth experience often associated with mental health problems. The present study aimed to examine the effect of the sacred hour on the depression in traumatic childbirths. Methods: In this clinical trial, 84 mothers who had experienced a traumatic childbirth were randomly allocated into the intervention (n = 42) and control (n = 42) groups. The intervention group received sacred hour (baby\u2019s nine instinctive responses), but the control group received only the routine care. Postnatal depression was evaluated as primary outcome at 2 week, 4-6 week and 3 month intervals after the delivery. The data were analyzed using t test, chi-square test and the repeated measures analysis of variance. Results: The results showed that the marginal total mean (SD: standard deviation) scores of depression in the intervention and control groups were 7.5 (2.6) and 9.6 (2.6); therefore, the mean difference (95% CI) between the groups (-2.1, (-3.2,-0.95)) was significant. Conclusion: The implementation of the sacred hour is recommended as a preventive approach to reduce the postnatal depression in women with a traumatic childbirth experience.",

This was a case-control study of 366 children aged 2 to 6 years (176 boys and 190 girls) from three cities. The case group comprised overweight children, as defined by body mass index (BMI) for age greater than or equal to the 85 th percentile. The main exposure analyzed was early weaning (exclusive or predominant breastfeeding for less than four months). Early weaning was a significant risk factor for overweight in univariate analysis (OR = 1.69; 95% CI: 1.10\u20132.60; p = 0.02), but not in multivariate analysis (OR = 1.42; 95% CI: 0.86\u20132.34; p = 0.17).

In our study, the protective effect of breastfeeding against overweight was only shown in univariate analysis; it did not persist after controlling for other variables. It is possible that breastfeeding has only a small protective role against overweight in comparison with other variables of greater importance. Our results suggest that the potential protective effect of breastfeeding against overweight among preschool children is weaker than genetic and other environmental factors.",

It is necessary to observe laryngeal and vocal signs and symptoms associated with BN, especially in teenagers whose voices are going through a period of change. The contribution of this type of investigation, which should begin with a clinical history, is essential for minimizing the complications of bulimia nervosa.

    "abstract": "Atopic dermatitis (AD) is one of the most common pathologic conditions of skin in children. The effect of breastfeeding on the risk of AD remains controversial. The aim of this study was to determine the counts of cytokine-producing cells in the mothers' breast milk of infants with and without AD to assess association, if any. Breast milk samples (10 ml) were obtained from mothers of 25 infants with AD and of 26 healthy infants as a control group. The number of cytokine-producing cells including interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-13 (IL-13) and IL-4 in the milk samples was determined using an enzyme-linked immunospot assay technique. The mean of IL-13-producing cells in milk was significantly lower in mothers of AD-affected infants in comparison with mothers of normal infants (324.91\u00b1255.45 vs. 538.93\u00b1465.39, P <0.05). There were no significant differences between mothers of infants with and without AD regarding milk count of IFN-\u03b3-, TNF-\u03b1- and IL-4-producing cells. Our results showed lower number of IL-13-producing cells in milk of mothers of infants with AD. Therefore, lower count of IL-13-producing cells in mothers' milk may confer a susceptibility to AD. Further studies with a large number of samples need to be done to confirm our findings.",

    "abstract": "University students, who are at risk of eating disorders (ED), are more liable to use cognitive enhancers and psychostimulants to improve their cognitive functions and lose weight. ED in Palestinian male students is a neglected health issue. We aimed to investigate the prevalence and the association between ED and cognitive enhancers, and psychostimulants use among An-Najah National University students (ANNU). In a cross-sectional study conducted in 2020 at ANNU, 1047 students completed anonymous surveys for cognitive enhancers practice, the Eating Attitude Test-26 (EAT-26), Sick, Control, One, Fat and FOOD (SCOFF) screening tests. The prevalence of ED among ANNU students was 21.2% based on EAT-26 (17.1% in males, 23.8% in females) and 31.5% based on SCOFF (24.0% in males, 36.3% in females). The binary logistic regression revealed that students at risk to have ED were water-pipe smokers (OR: 1.471, p-value 0.047), especially males, while students who were less likely to have ED were males (OR: 0.341, p-value<0.001), coffee users (OR: 0.581, p-value 0.014) and chocolate users (OR: 0.530, p-value 0.041) than nonusers. Moreover, the risk of ED increased with increasing body mass index (p-value<0.01). Clinical medical students showed the lowest prevalence (11.1%) compared to preclinical (22.5%), health sciences (23.7%), and non-medical students (20.9%) (p-value 0.059). Our findings highlight water-pipe smoking as a significant health problem in males with ED, which may require unique treatment and prevention strategies. Moreover, coffee and chocolate consumption were associated with decreased risk of ED, only among males. The gender-gap in ED prevalence was very narrow compared to international results. These results prompt the need to focus on both genders in future studies instead of females. They also suggest the urgent need to address ED among Palestinian university students by educating students about mental health, identifying high-risk students, and offering easily accessible psychological help.",

    "abstract": "Eating disorders (EDs) are complex pathologies which require equally complex treatment strategies. These strategies should be multidisciplinary, personalised interventions, performed in appropriate settings along a healthcare continuum from inpatient to community care. Personalisation, and the complexity of levels of care and interventions make evaluation of treatments difficult. The present study aims to measure the effectiveness of a complex treatment programme for EDs which includes hospitalisation, day hospital and outpatient settings. Our purpose is to assess the complete therapeutic process of each patient through all these levels of care, capturing the multiplicity of trajectories that a programme of these characteristics involves. This protocol describes a multicentre, naturalistic, observational study. All patients starting between November 2017 and October 2020 in a healthcare network for EDs in Spain are being invited to participate. The first phase of intensive change monitoring to November 2020 is followed by lower intensity follow-up until October 2025. In the first phase progress of all participants is assessed every 3\u2009weeks using specific measures for ED and the Clinical Outcomes Routine Evaluation system, a family of instruments specifically designed to measure change in psychotherapy. In the second phase data collection will happen quarterly. Both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses will be conducted, with a special focus on patterns and predictors of change studied through multilevel linear models. The study has been approved by the Research Bioethics Committee of the University of Barcelona (no. IRB00003099) and the ethical committee of ITA Mental Health, the organisation to which all participating centres belong. Dissemination will be in papers for peer-reviewed research journals and to clinicians working with ED. NCT04127214 .",

    "abstract": "Honokiol (HK) is a natural bioactive compound with proven antineoplastic properties against melanoma. However, it shows very low bioavailability when administered orally. Alternatively, topical administration may offer a promising route. The objective of the current study was to fabricate HK transfersomes (HKTs) for topical treatment of melanoma. As an ultradeformable carrier system, transfersomes can overcome the physiological barriers to topical treatment of melanoma: the stratum corneum and the anomalous tumor microenvironment. Moreover, the immunomodulatory and stemness-regulation roles of HKTs were the main interest of this study. TFs were prepared using the modified scalable heating method. A three-factor, three-level Box\u2013Behnken design was utilized for the optimization of the process and formulation variables. Intracellular uptake and cytotoxicity of HKTs were evaluated in nonactivated and stromal cell\u2013activated B16F10 melanoma cells to investigate the influence of the complex tumor microenvironment on the efficacy of HK. Finally, ELISA and Western blot were performed to evaluate the expression levels of TGF-\u03b2 and clusters of differentiation (CD47 and CD133, respectively). The optimized formula exhibited a mean size of 190 nm, highly negative surface charge, high entrapment efficiency, and sustained release profile. HKTs showed potential to alleviate the immunosuppressive characteristics of B16F10 melanoma in vitro via downregulation of TGF-\u03b2 signaling. In addition, HKTs reduced expression of the \u201cdo not eat me\u201d signal \u2014 CD47. Moreover, HKTs possessed additional interesting potential to reduce the expression of the stem-like cell marker CD133. These outcomes were boosted upon combination with metformin, an antihyperglycemic drug recently reported to possess different functions in cancer, while combination with collagenase, an extracellular matrix\u2013depleting enzyme, produced detrimental effects. HKTs represent a promising scalable formulation for treatment of the aggressive B16F10 melanoma, which is jam-packed with immunosuppressive and stem-like cell markers.",

Many resource-limited regions in Africa do not line-up with these recommendations, therefore EBF promotion efforts on the continent need to be scaled up and monitored. This study explores the human milk intake volumes of 5 countries (Benin, Central African Republic, Morocco, South Africa and Tanzania) both at country level and in a pooled sample of children at 3 months (n= 355) and at 6 months (n=193). Mean human milk intake volumes in the pooled samples were 697.6 g/day at 3 months and 714.9 g/day at 6 months. EBF was determined both by maternal recall as well as using the deuterium oxide dose-to-mother technique, using two different cut-offs of non-milk oral intake. Comparison of these results showed substantial over-reporting of EBF by maternal recall, which suggests that actual rates of EBF are even lower than reported, thus highlighting the importance of scaling-up EBF promotion strategies.",

    "abstract": "Postpartum contraception is undergoing major changes, not only in timing, but also in content. Failure to provide immediate postpartum contraception contributes to the problems of unintended pregnancies and rapid repeat pregnancy because often the highest-risk women do not return for postpartum care. If they do attend that visit, they have often lost the insurance coverage that would enable them to use the most effective forms of birth control. Most of the issues surrounding early initiation of progestin-only methods and breastfeeding have been favorably resolved. In some cases, insurance coverage for delivery has been expanded to cover the costs of providing intrauterine devices and implants before the woman is discharged home. All of these new opportunities shift the burden of counseling about postpartum contraception onto the shoulders of the prenatal care provider. This article provides information about the advantages and disadvantages of providing immediate postpartum contraception with each of the eligible methods so clinicians can provide the needed counseling both during pregnancy and during hospitalization for delivery. It also provides guidance for initiation of bridging contraception, if needed, to initiate a method for a woman later in the postpartum period.",

Twenty neonates, with major AL and severe GER after primary repair were managed with decompressing gastrostomy and transgastric FJ and analyzed prospectively. Male to female ratio was 1.7:1. Mean birth weight was 2.2 kg. Anastomotic gap ranged from 0 to 4 cm. The amount of leak was more than 20% of nasogastric feeds. Gastrostomy and FJ was done on an average of the 12 th postoperative day, after observing the general condition, chest tube output, lung expansion, and ventilatory requirement. There was a drastic reduction in chest tube output and lung expanded in all patients. Average hospital stay was 36 days (8-80 days). Sixty percentage patients were discharged successfully on FJ. Esophagogram demonstrated healing and leak free patency after an average of 1.5 months. GER was noted in seven patients, four developed stricture, and one had pseudodiverticulum in follow-up. Decompressing gastrostomy and FJ can be an alternative to managing major ALs. It helps in healing of anastomotic dehiscence and in preserving the native esophagus.",

The protein was purified 14-fold to a single band identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, with an apparent molecular mass of 56.7 kDa. The specific activity of the purified enzyme was 708 \u03bcmol/min/mg protein using cellobiose as substrate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest specific activity reported among \u03b2-glucosidases to date. The purified PaBG1b showed optimal activity at pH 5.0 and retained more than 65 % of the activity between pH 4.0 and 6.5. The activity was stable up to 50 \u00b0C for 30 min. Kinetic studies on cellobiose revealed that the K m was 5.3 mM, and the V max was 1,020 \u03bcmol/min/mg. The internal amino acid sequence of PaBG1b was analyzed, and two continuous sequences (a total of 39 amino acids) of the C-terminal region were elucidated. Based on these amino acid sequences, a full-length cDNA (1,552 bp) encoding 502 amino acids was isolated. The encoded protein showed high similarity to \u03b2-glucosidases from glycoside hydrolase family 1. Thus, the current study demonstrated the potential of PaBG1b for application in enzymatic biomass-conversion as a donor gene for heterologous recombination of cellulase-producing agents (fungi or bacteria) or an additive enzyme for cellulase products based on the high-performance of PaBG1b as a digestive enzyme in cockroaches.",

    "abstract": "Anorexia is commonly present in persons with cancer and a major component of cancer cachexia. There are multiple causes of anorexia in cancer. Peripherally, these can be due to (i) substances released from or by the tumour, e.g. pro-inflammatory cytokines, lactate, and parathormone-related peptide; (ii) tumours causing dysphagia or altering gut function; (iii) tumours altering nutrients, e.g. zinc deficiency; (iv) tumours causing hypoxia; (v) increased peripheral tryptophan leading to increased central serotonin; or (vi) alterations of release of peripheral hormones that alter feeding, e.g. peptide tyrosine tyrosine and ghrelin. Central effects include depression and pain, decreasing the desire to eat. Within the central nervous system, tumours create multiple alterations in neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and prostaglandins that modulate feeding. Many of these neurotransmitters appear to produce their anorectic effects through the adenosine monophosphate kinase/methylmalonyl coenzyme A/fatty acid system in the hypothalamus. Dynamin is a guanosine triphosphatase that is responsible for internalization of melanocortin 4 receptors and prostaglandin receptors. Dynamin is up-regulated in a mouse model of cancer anorexia. A number of drugs, e.g. megestrol acetate, cannabinoids, and ghrelin agonists, have been shown to have some ability to be orexigenic in cancer patients.",

    "abstract": "Binge drinking among alcohol consumers is a common occurrence, and may result in the development of numerous diseases, including liver disorders. It has previously been reported that natural killer T (NKT) cells induce alcohol-associated liver injury by promoting neutrophil infiltration. In the present study, the role of the orphan nuclear receptor small heterodimer partner (SHP), which is encoded by the NR0B2 gene, in acute binge drinking-induced liver injury was investigated. SHP-knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) control mice were intragastrically administered single doses of alcohol. The plasma concentrations of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase in SHP-KO mice following alcohol treatment were significantly increased compared with WT mice. However, results of oil red O staining and 2\u2032,7\u2032-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate staining indicated that levels of acute binge drinking-associated hepatic lipid accumulation and oxidative stress were not significantly different between WT and SHP-KO alcohol-treated mice. Notably, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 mRNA expression in the liver of SHP-KO mice was significantly increased following alcohol administration, compared with WT mice. Furthermore, the mRNA expression levels of C-C motif chemokine ligand 2, C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 2 and interleukin-4, which are all potent chemoattractants of NKT cells, as well as neutrophil expression levels, were significantly increased in the livers of SHP-KO mice compared with WT mice following alcohol administration, as determined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and flow cytometry. Enhanced infiltration of NKT cells, determined by flow cytometry, was also demonstrated in the livers of SHP-KO mice following alcohol administration, compared with WT mice. The results of the present study indicate that SHP may be involved in liver-associated protective mechanisms, with regards to the attenuation of damage caused by acute binge drinking, via regulation of NKT cell and neutrophil migration to the liver. The modulation of SHP may be a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of acute binge drinking-induced liver injury.",

    "abstract": "Does breastfeeding alter early brain development? The prevailing consensus from large epidemiological studies posits that early exclusive breastfeeding is associated with improved measures of IQ and cognitive functioning in later childhood and adolescence. Prior morphometric brain imaging studies support these findings, revealing increased white matter and sub-cortical gray matter volume, and parietal lobe cortical thickness, associated with IQ, in adolescents who were breastfed as infants compared to those who were exclusively formula-fed. Yet it remains unknown when these structural differences first manifest and when developmental differences that predict later performance improvements can be detected. In this study, we used quiet magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to compare measures of white matter microstructure (mcDESPOT measures of myelin water fraction) in 133 healthy children from 10\u00a0months through 4\u00a0years of age, who were either exclusively breastfed a minimum of 3\u00a0months; exclusively formula-fed; or received a mixture of breast milk and formula. We also examined the relationship between breastfeeding duration and white matter microstructure. Breastfed children exhibited increased white matter development in later maturing frontal and association brain regions. Positive relationships between white matter microstructure and breastfeeding duration are also exhibited in several brain regions, that are anatomically consistent with observed improvements in cognitive and behavioral performance measures. While the mechanisms underlying these structural differences remains unclear, our findings provide new insight into the earliest developmental advantages associated with breastfeeding, and support the hypothesis that breast milk constituents promote healthy neural growth and white matter development. \u2022 First investigation of breast-feeding and early infant brain myelination. \u2022 Breastfed infants shown improved brain development by 2\u00a0years of age. \u2022 Duration of breastfeeding is positively associated with behavioral performance.

Population-based survey. A representative sample of 3028 men and women. Participants were categorised into four groups based on their reporting of binge eating in the past 3 months: non-binge eating group (no OBE or SBE), OBE group, SBE group and OSBE group (both OBE and SBE). Demographics (age, genderand body mass index, BMI), binge eating, distress, weight/shape overvaluation and health-related quality of life. Groups were compared on sociodemographic information, overvaluation and health-related quality of life. The OBE and SBE groups were also compared on the distress related to binge eating. No differences were found between the SBE group and OBE group in age, gender, BMI, mental health-related quality of life and overvaluation (all p>0.05). However, differences were found in the OSBE participants, namely that they were younger, had a higher mean BMI, lower mental health-related quality of life and higher overvaluation of weight/shape than the non-binge-eating participants (all p<0.001). Proportions of participants who reported distress related to binge eating in the OBE and SBE groups also did not differ (p=0.678). There is little difference in the demographic profile or burden of people who engage in OBE versus SBE, supporting the proposed inclusion of SBE in the diagnostic criteria for eating disorders in International Classification of Diseases-11.

To describe the design and justification of a combined breastfeeding, national Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)-based feasibility randomized controlled trial, the electronic Monitoring Of Mom's Schedule (eMOMS TM ) study. eMOMS TM compares the feasibility and efficacy of three interventions on six-month postpartum weight loss among women with a BMI \u226525. The intervention is delivered via Facebook and includes three groups: DPP and breastfeeding (eMOMS1); DPP only (eMOMS2); and Usual Care (eMOMS3). Recruitment is ongoing at two clinical sites (rural and urban). A total of 72 women, 24 per group, will be randomly assigned to one of the three groups. It is anticipated that women in eMOMS1 will have greater weight loss and increased length of breastfeeding at three and six months postpartum compared to women in eMOMS2 and eMOMS3. Additional data will be collected on metabolic markers, anthropometrics, physical activity, nutrition, breastfeeding, and depression. Program cost will be compared to that of traditionally scheduled group meetings. Expected study completion date: October 2021.

    "abstract": "Dietary quality is important for children\u2019s growth and development. Poor dietary quality and maternal depression are prevalent among low-income, Hispanic families. Maternal depression likely influences child feeding before and during the meal. This secondary data analysis of an observational feeding study (2007\u20132008) examined how maternal depressive symptomology relates to dietary quality of dinner served to and consumed by Head Start preschoolers in Houston, TX (n\u00a0=\u00a082 mother-child dyads). A digital photography method assessed food served and consumed by the child at three separate dinner meals in families\u2019 homes. Healthy Eating Index-2010 (HEI) was calculated and averaged across the three meals to measure dietary quality (possible range 0\u2013100). Maternal depression was assessed by the Centers for Epidemiologic Depression Scale (CES-D, possible range 0\u201360). A series of linear regression models were developed, regressing the total CES-D score and all four CES-D subscales onto both the dietary quality of the meal served and consumed. Dinners served had a HEI of 45.70\u00a0\u00b1\u00a09.19 and dinners consumed had a HEI of 44.65\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07.34. Clinically significant depressive symptomology (CES-D\u00a0\u2265\u00a016) was reported by 28% of mothers. Maternal depressive symptomology and the dietary quality served were not related.

    "abstract": "The augmentative releases of mass-reared Aphytis spp. (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae) parasitoids are widely used against armored scales. The nutritional status and the initial egg load of Aphytis spp. females are key to their success as biological control agents. For these reasons, this work focuses on the study of providing a protein feed to Aphytis lingnanensis (Compere) and A. melinus DeBach to improve the egg load before their release. The addition of protein to a honey diet during the first 2\u2009d after the adult parasitoid emergence increased the initial egg load in both species of parasitoids by more than five eggs. Furthermore, the addition of protein increased the total number of eggs laid by A. lingnanensis on oleander scale, Aspidiotus nerii Bouch\u00e9 (Hemiptera: Diaspididae). In contrast, this effect was not observed on A. melinus probably because A. nerii is considered a suboptimal host for this parasitoid. The host-feeding activities of the two Aphytis species were differentially affected by the addition of protein to their diets. These results may have direct implications for augmentative biological control programs, especially during transportation from insectaries to the field, a period of time when parasitoids are deprived of hosts.",

    "abstract": "Breast milk is the best natural essential nutrition to newborns and infants. However, the practice of breastfeeding (BF) has declined in Saudi Arabia. The objective of this study was to assess the knowledge and practice of BF with their determinants among mothers in Riyadh. In this cross-sectional study, 252 mothers attending the well-baby clinics in Riyadh from March 2016 to May 2017 were selected randomly with their consent and studied by a standardized questionnaire. Of the 252 women, 69.4% were 25\u201335 years of age and 56.7% with a bachelor degree or higher education. Nearly 75% mothers had education on BF before our study. Mixed feeding was the most preferred method (51.6%) followed by artificial milk (29.4%). The most reported reason for discontinuing BF was breast milk insufficiency (37.3%) and of breastfeed continuation was their perceived benefit (36.6%). Excellent knowledge was observed among 12.7%, good knowledge in 57.1%, and unsatisfactory level in 30.2% mothers. The regression model shows that high school education improved the knowledge by 10.9 points ( P = 0.024) and undergraduate by 18.7 points ( P value = 0.001) when compared to women who were literate. Women with parity >5 improved knowledge score by 17.3 points ( P < 0.001). We observed that majority (57.1%) of Saudi mothers had a moderate level of knowledge on BF benefits and 19% had practiced exclusive BF. There is a need for better educational programs to increase awareness on its benefits for the health situation in the country on the long term.",

    "abstract": " Background: By the time a child is 24 mo old, 50% of parents report experiencing picky eating behaviors with their child. These behaviors include consuming an inadequate dietary variety, eating the same foods repeatedly, and an unwillingness to try either new or familiar foods. Previous research has established relations with regard to the impact of parent feeding strategies on child mealtime behaviors and how parent feeding strategies are influenced by parenting style; however, to our knowledge, no studies have investigated whether there is an association between parenting style and perceived child mealtime behaviors specifically related to picky eating.  Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a relation exists between general parenting style and both parent feeding strategies and perceived picky eater and non\u2013picky eater (NPE) behaviors.  Methods: Parents of 2- to 5-y-old children ( n = 525) completed 2 online surveys: 1 ) the Mealtime Assessment Survey, which measures the frequency of parent and child mealtime behaviors, and 2 ) the Parenting Styles and Dimensions Questionnaire, which measures authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive parenting styles. Spearman's correlation analysis was conducted to determine the relations between parenting style and mealtime behavior.  Results: Positive correlations were found between an authoritative parenting style and NPE behaviors, as well as parent mealtime strategies that promote positive eating habits. Authoritarian and permissive parenting styles were positively correlated with child behaviors associated with picky eating and parent mealtime strategies that can negatively influence child feeding.  Conclusions: These findings suggest that a relation exists between general parenting style and both parent and child mealtime behaviors; however, the directionality of the relation remains unknown. The positive correlations seen within the authoritative parenting style with regard to NPE behaviors suggest the use of authoritative feeding methods to overcome feeding difficulties.",

    "abstract": "Prior to acquisition of the first host blood meal, the anautogenous mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus requires a period of time in order to prepare for the blood feeding and, later, vitellogenesis. In the current study, we conducted whole transcriptome analyses of adult female Culex mosquitoes to identify genes that may be necessary for both taking of the blood meal, and processing of the blood meal in adult female mosquitoes Cx. quinquefasciatus. We examined temporal expression of genes for the periods of post eclosion and prior to the female freely taking a blood meal. We further evaluated the temporal expression of certain genes for the periods after the taking of a blood meal to identify genes that may be necessary for both the taking of the blood meal, and the processing of the blood meal . We found that adult females required a minimum of 48 h post-eclosion before they freely took their first blood meal. We hypothesized that gene expression signatures were altered in the mosquitoes before blood feeding in preparation for the acquisition of the blood meal through changes in multiple gene expression. To identify the genes involved in the acquisition of blood feeding, we quantified the gene expression levels of adult female Cx. quinquefasciatus using RNA Seq throughout a pre-blooding period from 2 to 72 h post eclosion at 12 h intervals. A total of 325 genes were determined to be differentially-expressed throughout the pre-blooding period, with the majority of differentially-expressed genes occurring between the 2 h and 12 h post-eclosion time points. Among the up-regulated genes were salivary proteins, cytochrome P450s, odorant-binding proteins, and proteases, while the majority of the down-regulated genes were hypothetical or cuticular genes. In addition, Trypsin was found to be up-regulated immediately following blood feeding, while trypsin and chymotrypsin were up-regulated at 48h and 60h post blood-feeding, respectively, suggesting that these proteases are likely involved in the digestion of the blood meal. Overall, this study reviewed multiple genes that might be involved in the adult female competency for blood meal acquisition in mosquitoes.",

On the basis of the World Health Organization child growth standards, stunting is a height of <\u22122 SD of the z-score for the child\u2019s age. There are several major causes of stunting. One is the inability to optimize child feeding practices. The aim of this study was to explore the feeding practices that lead to stunting in toddlers in Jakarta. The participants in this study were 15 mothers. Content analysis was the method that was chosen for this study. The data analysis revealed four themes that describe the feeding practices for toddlers with stunting in Jakarta: i) mothers providing instant porridge and ready-to-serve steamed chicken rice; ii) a feeding frequency of small portions only 2-3 times per day; iii) a lack of diet diversity; and iv) the suboptimal intake of iron-rich foods. The provision of effective education about appropriate feeding practices to pregnant women and mothers with toddlers is expected to reduce the incidence of stunting in Indonesia.",

This study investigated the effects of 8-h time restricted feeding on body weight and metabolic disease risk factors in obese adults. Obese subjects ( n =\u200a23) participated in an 8-h time restricted feeding intervention (ad libitum feeding between 10:00 to 18:00\u200ah, water fasting between 18:00 to 10:00\u200ah) for 12 weeks.

    "abstract": "Anorexia/cachexia is a common and currently mostly untreatable complication of advanced cancer. It is also a feature of a number of chronic diseases and can also occur as part of the normal ageing process. Over recent years, two different, but sometimes overlapping, processes have been identified to mediate anorexia/cachexia: those that act primarily on muscle reducing its mass and function, and processes that decrease nutrition leading to loss of both fat and muscle. In the case of at least some cancers, the latter process is sometimes driven by marked overexpression of macrophage inhibitory cytokine-1/growth differentiation factor 15 (MIC-1/GDF15). MIC-1/GDF15 is a transforming growth factor beta (TGF-\u03b2) family cytokine that is found in the serum of all normal individuals at an average concentration of about 0.6\u00a0ng/ml. Its increased expression in both cancers and other diseases can result in 10\u2013100-fold or more elevation of its serum levels. In experimental animals, serum MIC-1/GDF15 levels at the lower end of this range induce anorexia by direct actions of the circulating cytokine on feeding centres in the brain. Mice with tumours overexpressing MIC-1/GDF15 display decreased food intake, loss of lean and fat mass and cachexia. That this process also mediates anorexia/cachexia in humans is suggested by the fact that there is a direct correlation between the degree of serum MIC-1/GDF15 elevation and the amount of cancer-related weight loss, the first such relationship demonstrated. Further, in experimental animals, weight loss can be reversed by neutralisation of tumour-produced MIC-1/GDF15 with a specific monoclonal antibody, suggesting the possibility of effective therapy of patients with the devastating complication of anorexia/cachexia.",

A structured questionnaire assessing physical activity, dietary habits, parental guidance regarding dietary intake and psychological aspects in relation to social functioning, body weight and image was completed by each adolescent. Three hundred and thirty-five adolescents (181 boys) formed the study group. Obese participants were found to have significantly fewer friends (p\u00a0=\u00a0.050) and preferred indoor sedentary activities (p\u00a0=\u00a0.041). No differences were observed within the groups when questioned about their eating habits in terms of appetite and hunger. The majority of participants reported frequent consumption of homemade snacks in school resulting in no significant difference within the groups. Finally, body weight satisfaction was recorded for only 5.66% of the obese children, 25.66% and 68.64% of overweight and normal-weight participants respectively. Our findings support the notion that adolescents are perfectly capable of expressing their opinions. When planning interventional programs for the management of adolescent obesity their views should be strongly considered.",

    "abstract": "The uptake of prevention of mother-to-child-transmission (PMTCT) services has improved in South Africa but challenges remain, including adherence to the World Health Organization's (WHO) PMTCT recommendations of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF), taking antiretroviral medication (ARV); testing for early infant diagnosis; and reducing stigma. Women who practice EBF for the first 6 months are less likely to transmit HIV to their infants, yet only 7% of women EBF for 6 months in South Africa. Adherence to these recommendations remains challenging because of difficulties relating to disclosure and stigma. To address this challenge, the feeding buddy concept was developed based on studies where ARV buddies have proved effective in providing support for women living with HIV. Buddies have demonstrated a positive effect on providing emotional and social support to adhere to PMTCT guidelines. A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted in 16 selected randomly assigned clinics in uMhlathuze and uMlalazi districts of KwaZulu Natal, South Africa. HIV-positive pregnant women (n = 625) who intended to breastfeed were enrolled at 8 control clinics and 8 intervention clinics. The clinics were stratified on the basis of urban/rural/periurban locale and then randomly allocated to either intervention or control. In the intervention clinics, the mother chose a feeding buddy to be enrolled alongside her. Quantitative interviews with mothers and their chosen buddies took place at enrollment during pregnancy and at routine postdelivery visits at day 3 and weeks 6, 14 and 22. Women in the control clinics were followed using the same evaluation schedule. The trial evaluated the effect of a voluntary PMTCT feeding buddy program on HIV-infected women's adherence to PMTCT recommendations and stigma reduction. The proportion of women exclusively feeding at 5.5 months postpartum was the primary end-point of the trial. In-depth interviews were conducted among a convenience sample of PMTCT counselors, community caregivers, mothers, and buddies from intervention clinics and control clinics to document their overall experiences. The information collected in this study could be used to guide recommendations on how to build upon the current South Africa. PMTCT \u201cbuddy\u201d strategy and to improve safe infant feeding. The information would be applicable to many other similar resource poor settings with poor social support structures.",

We review the literature addressing symptoms of mental disorders in those at risk for exercise addiction. The included studies assess eating disorders, depression, anxiety, other addiction and borderline personality disorder. Those at risk of exercise addiction suffer from symptoms of mental disorders more frequently than those not at risk. Exercise addiction is one of several behavioral addictions which has not yet been designated as an addictive disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 (DSM-5). This is in part due to a lack of clarity concerning co-occurring mental disorders of individuals at risk for exercise addiction. The aim of this review is to summarise the spectrum of psychopathology in populations at risk of exercise addiction. The MEDLINE, Web of Science and PsycINFO databases were searched. All studies from the date of database creation until February 2020 were considered eligible. Terms used were \u201cexercise addiction\u201d and other mental disorders mentioned in conjunction with substance-related and addictive disorders. Studies were included if they assessed risk for exercise addiction and at least one other mental disorder. Twenty studies were included. The disorders assessed were eating disorders (n\u00a0=\u00a014), depression (n\u00a0=\u00a06), anxiety (n\u00a0=\u00a04), other substance-related and addictive disorders (n\u00a0=\u00a05), and borderline personality disorder (n\u00a0=\u00a01). In thirteen of the studies, evidence was found for higher rates of at least one mental disorder (most commonly eating disorders, anxiety and other addictive disorders) in individuals at risk for exercise addiction, compared to those not at risk. Individuals at risk for exercise addiction show a broad range of mental disorders as assessed by self-report, which is in line with sufferers of other addictive disorders. Systematic psychological and clinical assessments in those at risk of exercise addiction are worthwhile, and will serve to characterize the mental health problems of individuals suffering from exercise addiction.",

Studies show that nutrition during early infancy may contribute to later obesity. Hence, this study is designed to determine if the variation in complementary feeding practices poses a risk for the development of obesity later in life. A mixed methods approach will be used in conducting this study. The target participants are infants born from January to June 2015 in the South East Asia Community Observatory (SEACO) platform. The SEACO is a Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) that is established in the District of Segamat in the state of Johor, Malaysia. For the quantitative strand, the sociodemographic data, feeding practices, anthropometry measurement and total nutrient intake will be assessed. The assessment will occur around the time complementary feeding is expected to start (7 Months) and again at 12 months. A 24-hour diet recall and a 2-day food diary will be used to assess the food intake. For the qualitative strand, selected mothers will be interviewed to explore their infant feeding practices and factors that influence their practices and food choices in detail. Ethical clearance for this study was sought through the Monash University Human Research and Ethics Committee (application number CF14/3850-2014002010).

Maternal and neonatal survival were reassuring (98% [10 437/10 597] and 99% [1155/1163], respectively). Neonatal disease was rare, with only 41 possible cases of infection reported in the literature. Of 2351 ongoing COVID-19 therapeutic clinical trials, 1282 were enrolling persons of reproductive age and 65% (829/1282) excluded pregnant persons. Pregnancy was an exclusion criterion for 69% (75/109) of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, 80% (28/35) of lopinavir/ritonavir, and 48% (44/91) of convalescent plasma studies. We identified 48 actively recruiting or completed drug trials reporting inclusion of this population. There are limited published reports of COVID-19 in pregnancy despite more than 14 million cases worldwide. To date, clinical outcomes appear reassuring, but data related to important long-term outcomes are missing or not yet reported.

There was good internal reliability for the final 4-item BBAT (Cronbach\u05f3s alpha=0.668) and the midwives who used it showed a high correlation in the consistency of its use (ICC=0.782). Midwives were able to score a breast feed consistently using the BBAT and felt that it helped them with advice to mothers about improving positioning and attachment to make breast feeding less painful, particularly with a tongue-tied infant. The tool showed strong correlation with breast feeding self-efficacy, indicating that more efficient breast feeding technique is associated with increased confidence in breast feeding an infant. the BBAT is a concise breast feeding assessment tool facilitating accurate, rapid breast feeding appraisal, and targeting breast feeding advice to mothers acquiring early breast feeding skills or for those experiencing problems with an older infant. Accurate assessment is essential to ensure enhanced breast feeding efficiency and increased maternal self-confidence. the BBAT could be used both clinically and in research to target advice to improve breast feeding efficacy. Further research is needed to establish its wider usefulness.",

The Brunnstrom 6-stage rating of hemiplegia was adopted. During the different recovery stages of the upper limbs, the patients orally ate using a feeding spoon with a non-rotatory head and a 180\u00b0 rotating feeding spoon. The ability of these patients to eat by themselves was observed, and the basic activity of daily living (BADL) was assessed using the Barthel index (BI). The Brunnstrom assessment scale was used to analyze the results of the patient's upper limb function examination, and the results revealed that the 180\u00b0 rotating feeding spoon could assist patients with different degrees of upper limb dysfunction when eating independently. The 180\u00b0 rotating feeding spoon can assist patients with upper limb dysfunction when eating independently. For patients with different degrees of upper limb dysfunction, the spoon can provide different degrees of aid.",

The aim of the study was to assess the impact of community-based nutrition on infant nutrition. A mixed method approach using a structured questionnaire to collect quantitative data (n=234) and Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) for qualitative data was used in Narok County, Kenya. About 57% of the participants received nutrition and health information from hospital trained health personnel. Whereas most women indicated having attended antenatal clinics, very few delivered in the hospital (17%). Exclusive breastfeeding knowledge was below 50%, although not statistically significant (p=0.584) across the education spectrum as opposed to identification of malnutrition signs, which was significant (p<0.05). Whereas 74% of the participants had knowledge about signs of malnutrition, only 58% could identify the causes. Rating for complementary feeding among the study participants was about 61% for introduction of complementary foods and 80% for frequency of feeding. Vitamin A supplementation knowledge, antenatal clinic attendance and type of waste disposal were statistically significant (p<0.05) in relation to education level of the study participants. This study reveals the need to educate rural women for increased understanding and practice of appropriate infant and nutrition care through sustainable and effective essential nutrition actions.",

Ten girls diagnosed with AN at 10.0\u2009\u00b1\u20091.9 years, with prolonged severe growth failure (HV\u2009<\u20092.5\u2009cm/year for at least 18 months) at the age of 13.3\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1 years and delayed puberty after nutritional rehabilitation, were treated with hGH (0.040\u2009mg/kg/day) from a bone age of 10.9\u2009\u00b1\u20091.7 years until they reached adult height. Height and HV were measured before treatment and at 12-month intervals during treatment. Mean body mass index SDS remained unchanged, but HV increased significantly, from a median of 1.0 (0.7\u20132.1) to 7.1 (6.0\u20139.5)\u2009cm/year after one year ( P <\u20090.002) and 5.6 (4.8\u20136.2)\u2009cm/year after two years of treatment.

To understand why, we asked mothers in Western Canada how they felt about their breastfeeding experience. A total of 191 women (response rate 35%) responded to a survey distributed by public health nurses. While many women felt positive about their overall breastfeeding experience, others shared mixed or negative emotions. Several themes were evident: (a) Most women reported a variety of positive aspects beyond the health benefits, (b) lactation difficulties were commonly reported, and (c) diversity among the reflections highlights the uniqueness of each breastfeeding journey. The findings reaffirm the need for breastfeeding programs to holistically promote the range of positive aspects while providing realistic information on common challenges and strategies to overcome these.

    "abstract": "According to previously reported studies in the literature, a significant number of patients do not receive enteral nutrition in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) because of avoidable barriers. Optimal nutrition is a fundamental goal in PICU. This study aims to identify the barriers of enteral nutrition in PICU. A cross-sectional study of the results of a 25-item questionnaire-based survey distributed during the Annual International Critical Care Conference by the Saudi Critical Care Society. A 7-point Likert-type scale was used to rank the participants\u2019 responses, and the relative importance index (RII) approach was used to analyze the relative contribution of each indicator to its main theme. The factor and parallel analysis methods were used to assess the factorial and unidimensionality of the enteral feeding barriers scale. A total of 223 PICU healthcare workers from various intensive care settings responded to the survey. The top-three perceived barriers for commencing enteral feeding were due to the patient being hemodynamically unstable (M\u00a0=\u00a03.6 and SD\u00a0=\u00a01.70), delays and difficulties in obtaining small bowel access in patients not tolerating other types of enteral nutrition (M\u00a0=\u00a03.4 and SD\u00a0=\u00a01.52), or severe fluid restriction, particularly in postoperative cardiac surgery (M\u00a0=\u00a03.3 and SD\u00a0=\u00a01.59). The top perceived overall barriers to enteral feeding were the dietician-related issues (M\u00a0=\u00a03.3, SD\u00a0=\u00a01.32), barriers related to enteral feeding delivery (M\u00a0=\u00a03.16 and SD\u00a0=\u00a01.13), and medical practice-related (M\u00a0=\u00a03 and SD\u00a0=\u00a01.10) issues. The lowest reported overall barriers were the resource-related obstacles (M\u00a0=\u00a02.7 and SD\u00a0=\u00a01.26). Being hemodynamically unstable and other dietician-related reasons were the top overall barriers in commencing enteral feeding. Key messages: The dietitian support is highly warranted, as the top perceived overall barriers to enteral feeding were the dietician-related barriers (Mean 3.33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.32). The PICU healthcare workers perceived \u201cNot enough dietitian coverage during evenings, weekends and holidays\u201d as the top barrier to enteral feeding in PICU (Mean 3.83\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.75).",

Hence, we examined whether the displacement forces caused by a static magnetic field and the heating induced by radiofrequency radiation are substantial for spinal implants in a 7 T field. We investigated spinal rods of various lengths and materials, a screw, and a cross\u2010linking bridge in accordance with the American Society for Testing and Materials guidelines. The displacement forces of the metallic implants in static 7 T and 3 T static magnetic fields were measured and compared. The temperature changes of the implants during 15\u2010min\u2010long fast spin\u2010echo and balanced gradient\u2010echo image acquisition sequences were measured in the 7 T field. The deflection angles of the metallic spinal materials in the 7 T field were 5.0\u201321.0\u00b0 [median: 6.7\u00b0], significantly larger than those in the 3 T field (1.0\u20136.3\u00b0 [2.2\u00b0]). Among the metallic rods, the cobalt\u2013chrome rods had significantly larger deflection angles (17.8\u201321.0\u00b0 [19.8\u00b0]) than the pure titanium and titanium alloy rods (5.0\u20137.7\u00b0 [6.2\u00b0]). The temperature changes of the implants, including the cross\u2010linked rods, were 0.7\u20131.0\u00b0C [0.8\u00b0C] and 0.6\u20131.0\u00b0C [0.7\u00b0C] during the fast spin\u2010echo and balanced gradient\u2010echo sequences, respectively; these changes were slightly larger than those of the controls (0.4\u20131.1\u00b0C [0.5\u00b0C] and 0.3\u20130.9\u00b0C [0.6\u00b0C], respectively).

The purpose of this study was to examine how tongue pressure, which is an important factor during swallowing, is affected by eating postures in bed and wheelchair. A total of 43 healthy adults (13 men and 30 women; 29.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f5.9 years) and 33 elderly individuals requiring long-term care (14 men and 19 women; 83.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f7.8 years) participated. In both healthy and elderly participants, tongue pressure was measured in four different postures: a good and poor postures in bed (postures 1 and 2, respectively), and a good and poor postures in a reclining wheelchair (posture 3 and 4, respectively). Among the healthy participants, the mean tongue pressure was significantly higher in posture 1 (40.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f7.24\u202fkPa) than in posture 2 (37.6\u202f\u00b1\u202f8.68\u202fkPa) or posture 4 (38.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f8.14\u202fkPa)\u202f(P\u202f<\u202f0.05).

Method: Twenty-nine staff members and six patients and/or their family were interviewed. Results: Thematic analysis revealed four global themes: supporting practice, communication, complexity of feeding decisions, and patient and family-centered care. Staff described limited education and organizational policy around risk feeding decisions. Communication was considered a major factor in the success. Conclusion: Feeding decisions are complex in the hospital environment. The themes identified in this study provide a foundation for hospital guideline development and implementation.",

Our findings suggest that acculturation is a multidimensional construct characterized by distinct, though related, dimensions of orientation to ethnic Fijian and/or western/global culture with respect to a range of behaviors and attitudes. In contrast to theoretical models positing uni-dimensional, orthogonal, or oblique relations between cultural identities in individuals undergoing acculturation, our study findings support a heterogeneous pattern among correlations of dimensions across contrasting cultural identities.

This project 1 ) developed counseling cards based on existing evidence-based RF guidelines and 2 ) tested their feasibility in Ghana. Five RF counseling cards were developed focusing on eating with family; introducing new foods; hunger/satiety cues; food texture; and calming a child. Four focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with adult mothers and fathers of children younger than 3 y of age to assess the cultural appropriateness of the cards and accompanying key messages. The feasibility of including cards as part of IYCF counseling was tested via 1 ) systematic observation of 8 group education sessions utilizing the cards with the same target audience and 2 ) in-depth interviews with health care providers involved in IYCF training and/or counseling. FGD findings guided changes to all cards to ensure comprehension and cultural appropriateness. The group education sessions suggested that the counseling cards provided important RF messages that are specific, clear, and feasible to implement. Health care providers strongly endorsed the need for and utility of the RF counseling cards and felt they were feasible and important to integrate into the C-IYCFCP currently being used to deliver IYCF training and counseling in Ghana. The counseling cards have a strong potential to add key RF dimensions to IYCF training and counseling in Ghana. We developed and tested responsive feeding counseling cards that can substantially strengthen UNICEF's Community-based Infant and Young Child Feeding Counseling Package in Ghana.",

In this article, we review data on the underlying pathophysiology of AN-related osteoporosis and possible approaches to disease management. Available research suggests that low body weight and decreased gonadal function are the strongest predictors of bone loss and fractures in patients with AN. Additionally, other metabolic disturbances have been linked to bone loss, including growth hormone resistance, low leptin concentrations, and hypercortisolemia, but those correlations are less consistent and lack evidence of causality. In terms of treatment of AN-related bone disease, weight gain has the most robust impact on bone mineral density (BMD). Restoration of gonadal function seems to augment this effect and may independently improve BMD. Bisphosphonates, insulin-like growth factor 1 supplementation, and teriparatide may also be reasonable considerations, however need long-term efficacy and safety data.",

    "abstract": "The hypothalamic neuropeptide oxytocin regulates reproductive behavior and mother-infant interaction, and conclusive studies in humans indicate that oxytocin is also a potent modulator of psychosocial function. Pilot experiments have yielded first evidence that this neuropeptide moreover influences eating behavior. We briefly summarize currently available studies on the involvement of the oxytocin system in the pathophysiology of eating disorders, as well as on the effects of oxytocin administration in patients with these disorders. Brain administration of oxytocin in animals with normal weight, but also with diet-induced or genetically induced obesity, attenuates food intake and reduces body weight. In normal-weight and obese individuals, acute intranasal oxytocin delivery curbs calorie intake from main dishes and snacks. Such effects might converge with the poignant social and cognitive impact of oxytocin to also improve dysfunctional eating behavior in the therapeutic context. This assumption has received support in first studies showing that oxytocin might play a role in the disease process of anorexia nervosa. In contrast, respective experiments in patients with bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder are still scarce. We propose a framework of oxytocin\u2019s role and its therapeutic potential in eating disorders that aims at integrating social and metabolic aspects of its pharmacological profile, and ponder perspectives and limitations of oxytocin use in the clinical setting.",

Mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SE minutes/day of fussiness-crying in the 256 analyzed infants (FA, n\u2009=\u2009127 and FB, n\u2009=\u2009129) substantially decreased from baseline to study end in FA (291\u2009\u00b1\u200914 to 140\u2009\u00b1\u20098; \u201352%, P <\u2009.001), and FB (313\u2009\u00b1\u200914 to 153\u2009\u00b1\u200911, \u201351%, P <\u2009.001) with no difference between groups. Similarly, gassiness, spitting-up, vomiting and sleep pattern significantly improved by study end for both formulas. Mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SE IGSQ index scores significantly decreased from baseline to study end (FA: 44.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.9 to 28.6\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7; FB: 44.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.8 to 29.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.7; P <\u2009.001) with no differences between groups. Infant temperament and maternal anxiety also improved significantly in both groups by study end. Switching from standard, full-lactose, intact whey/casein infant formulas to either study formula resulted in an improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms and associated behaviors in infants with signs of feeding intolerance. https://clinicaltrials.gov , NCT02021058",

    "abstract": "Premature responding is a form of motor impulsivity that preclinical evidence has shown to predict compulsive drug seeking but has not yet been studied in humans. We developed a novel translation of the task, based on the rodent 5-choice serial reaction time task, testing premature responding in disorders of drug and natural food rewards. Abstinent alcohol- ( n = 30) and methamphetamine-dependent ( n = 23) subjects, recreational cannabis users ( n = 30), and obese subjects with ( n = 30) and without ( n = 30) binge eating disorder (BED) were compared with matched healthy volunteers and tested on the premature responding task. Compared with healthy volunteers, alcohol- and methamphetamine-dependent subjects and cannabis users showed greater premature responding with no differences observed in obese subjects with or without BED. Current smokers exhibited greater premature responding versus ex-smokers and nonsmokers. Alcohol-dependent subjects also had lower motivation for explicit monetary incentives. A Motivation Index correlated negatively with alcohol use and binge eating severity. Premature responding on a novel translation of a serial reaction time task was more evident in substance use disorders but not in obese subjects with or without BED. Lower motivation for monetary incentives linked alcohol use and binge eating severity. Our findings add to understanding the relationship between drug and natural food rewards.",

    "abstract": "Breastfeeding is one of the best ways to promote, develop, and secure the health of infants. Child abuse is one of the most common and most important problems in the world, and one of the factors that increase its incidence is substance dependency of the parents. Breastfeeding beyond the normal age range can be harmful to the health of the mother and baby, and may represent a pathological parent-child relationship. A little girl, who was breastfed until the age of 8 years by her heroin-dependent mother, was hospitalized in a child and adolescent psychiatric ward due to heroin dependency. During the investigations, it was found that not only had the girl been breastfed until this age, but she had also not been enrolled into a school. In other words, due to the mother\u2019s heroin dependency, her infant was also dependent on the drug. In the assessment and treatment of parents with substance related disorders, the possibility of child abuse should also be considered. When breastfeeding is continued beyond the normal age range, it is necessary to find the reason. By early detection and timely intervention, negative consequences for the child can be prevented.",

    "abstract": "Postoperative respiratory complications (PRC) are one of the most serious complications. Potentially life-threatening accidents can occur after an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ADF), such as airway obstruction and aspiration pneumonia. Despite numerous studies, preoperative predictive and preventive methodology has yet to be established. As reported in our previous study, the evaluation of preoperative dysphagia using the eating assessment tool (EAT-10) and a flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) is useful for predicting the incidence and risk factors of dysphagia after ADF. This prospective study comprised 60 consecutive patients who underwent ADF. An otolaryngologist and a speech-language-hearing therapist preoperatively and 1 week postoperatively evaluated dysphagia using EAT-10 and Hyodo-Komagane (H-K) scores during FEES. Patient demographics, comorbidities, and pre- and postoperative dysphagia were compared between patients with and without PRC. Seven of 60 (11.6%) patients had preoperative dysphagia diagnosed using the H-K score. A significant positive correlation existed between the pre- and postoperative H-K scores. Of all 60 cases, eight (13.3%) had PRC. Among them, two required reintubation due to airway obstruction and six had aspiration pneumonia. The PRC(+) group was significantly older and more prone to diabetes and asthma. The preoperative H-K score of the PRC(+) group was significantly higher than that of the PRC(\u2212) group. Postoperatively, but not preoperatively, EAT-10 was significantly higher in the PRC(+) group. Preoperative dysphagia may potentially exacerbate postoperative dysphagia after ADF. A preoperative evaluation of dysphagia using the H-K score during FEES is a useful method for predicting and reducing the risk of PRC. Level of Evidence: 3",

The present study aimed to identify an antenatal strategy for initiation and continuation of human BF, and to identify how Baby-Friendly Hospitals (BFHs) may positively influence the intention to breastfeed. A total of 414 pregnant Korean antenatal women were surveyed using questionnaires to determine current knowledge of the benefits of human breast milk, whether they planned to breastfeed after delivery, to continue BF after reinstatement in the workforce, are willing to abide by rooming-in care for infants, and plan to give birth at BFHs. We found that planning room-in care, greater awareness of BF benefits for infant and mother, participation in antenatal education programs, and provision of BF facilities in the workplace were positively associated with plans for exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) and longer BF duration. The mothers who planned to give birth at BFHs also desired to breastfeed immediately after birth, implement in-room care, continue BF at their workplace, participate in antenatal BF educational programs, and were more aware of the benefits of BF. If the beneficial effects of BFHs were well known to individuals, these would enhance the success rate of BF in Korea. Antenatal education and consequent acquisition of better knowledge of the benefits of BF are important for increasing the rate of BF practices.",

The complementary aim was to assess the safety of these strains in broiler rearing. A total of 500 one-day-old Ross 308 chicks were divided into four groups. The experimental factor was the admixture of bacterial preparation to the feed at different doses: the recommended maximum dose, a dose ten times higher, the recommended minimum dose, and a zero dose for the control group not receiving bacteria. Addition of bacteria to the diets did not have a significant effect on the final body weight, final body weight gain, nor total feed intake or feed conversion. However, lactic acid bacteria had a positive effect on chicken health. Mortality among chickens fed with LAB was reduced. Moreover, LAB feeding inhibited the growth of Salmonella spp. and Clostridium perfringens in the intestines. There were no significant differences in chicken performance by dose of bacteria in the feed. The group dosed with LAB ten times higher than the recommended maximum did not demonstrate changes in biochemical or haematological parameters of blood compared to the remaining groups. Feeding chicken broilers with two potentially probiotic LAB strains is safe and impacts animal health positively.",

We investigated risk factors in preadolescent boys and girls for the development of eating pathology in adolescence and young adulthood. This study is part of TRAILS (TRacking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey), a Dutch population\u2010based cohort study ( N = 2,229) from preadolescence into adulthood. Potential risk factors were measured at age 11, based on self\u2010report, reports of one of the parents, and records of the Preventive Child Healthcare. Variables included sociodemographic variables, pregnancy and perinatal factors, eating\u2010 and weight\u2010related factors, psychological functioning, stressful experiences and family factors. At age 19, two\u2010stage screening including interviews by eating disorder experts was used to examine the prevalence of eating disorders. At age 22 and 26, eating pathology was assessed by the Eating Disorder Diagnostic Scale. Preadolescent anxious distress and high weight were associated with eating pathology in adolescence and young adulthood in both boys and girls. Overeating in preadolescence was found to be a prodromal symptom of eating disorders during late adolescence. No evidence was found for sex\u2010specific risk factors. Anxious preadolescents with high weight are at increased risk for the development of eating pathology later on. Clinicians should be aware of eating disorder symptoms \u2014 like overeating \u2014 in this high\u2010risk group of children, and could consider an early intervention to prevent the development of full\u2010blown eating disorders.",

    "abstract": "In Egypt, rising maternal overweight and obesity is consistent with the transition to westernized diets and a growing reliance on energy\u2010dense, low nutrient foods. Although the first 1,000\u00a0days of life are the focus of many programmes designed to prevent many forms of malnutrition, little attention has been paid to maternal dietary practices and weight gain during pregnancy. This study used in\u2010depth interviews with pregnant women ( N =\u00a040), lactating women ( N =\u00a040), and nonlactating women ( N =\u00a040) to gain an understanding of behaviours, perceptions, and cultural beliefs in relation to maternal dietary intake during pregnancy, lactation, and nonlactation; weight gain during pregnancy; birth spacing; and family planning. Study findings reveal that food choice was driven by affordability, favoured foods, or foods considered appropriate for a specific life stage (pregnant, lactating, and nonlactating). Knowledge of weight gain during pregnancy is limited, especially with regards to excessive weight gain during pregnancy. Diet is often modified during lactation to support breast milk production, and a normal diet resumed when breastfeeding ceases. Within the context of breastfeeding, the lactational amenorrhea method provides an opportunity to improve exclusive breastfeeding practices, maternal diet during lactation, and the transition to other family planning methods by 6\u00a0months postpartum. Health care providers should discuss limiting maternal consumption of low nutrient foods such as junk foods, soda, and teas during pregnancy and postpartum. Dietary counselling should accompany information on appropriate weight gain during pregnancy and exercise to prevent excessive weight gain, in the context of the nutrition transition.",

BAT has been proposed to mediate both cold-induced thermogenesis (CIT) and diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT). We therefore investigated whether there is a relationship between CIT and DIT in humans. Nine healthy men (23\u00b13 years old, 23.0\u00b11.8 kg/m 2 ) completed 20 minutes of cold exposure (4\u00b0C) five days per week for four weeks. Before and after the intervention, CIT (the increase in RMR at 16\u00b0C relative to 22\u00b0C) was measured by a ventilated hood indirect calorimeter, whereas DIT was measured as the 24-hour thermic response to one day of 50% overfeeding (TEF 150% ) in a respiratory chamber. After the cold intervention, CIT more than doubled from 5.2\u00b114.2% at baseline to 12.0\u00b111.1% (p=0.05), in parallel with increased SNS activity. However, twenty-four-hour energy expenditure (2166\u00b1206 vs. 2118\u00b1188 kcal/day; p=0.15) and TEF 150% (7.4\u00b12.7% vs. 7.7\u00b11.6%; p=0.78) were unchanged. Moreover, there was no association between CIT and TEF 150% at baseline or post-intervention, nor in their changes (p\u22650.47). Cold acclimation resulted in increased CIT but not TEF 150% . Therefore, it is likely that CIT and DIT are mediated by distinct regulatory mechanisms.",

Participants consider alcohol use as culturally acceptable in Vietnamese society and a way for medical students to create and improve relationships with their friends, teachers, or work colleagues. Group affiliation and peer pressure to drink excessive alcohol are identified among medical students, especially male students. The culture of drinking behaviour was explored among medical students in Viet Nam. This study reveals a dichotomy between the belief of not being binge drinkers and the experience of many binge drinking occasions among medical students. This tension suggests future research about binge drinking behaviour of Vietnamese medical students is required.",

The Federal Ministries of Health and Agriculture and Natural Resources implement the intervention. The evaluation aims to assess a range of processes, outcomes and impacts. The SURE evaluation study is a theory-based, mixed methods study comprising impact and process evaluations. We hypothesise that the package of SURE interventions, including integrated health and agriculture behaviour change communication for nutrition, systems strengthening and multisectoral coordination, will result in detectable differences in minimum acceptable diet in children 6\u201323\u2009months and stunting in children 24\u201347\u2009months between intervention and comparison groups. Repeated cross-sectional household surveys will be conducted at baseline and endline to assess impact.

Tumor treating fields (TTFields) have emerged as a novel, locoregional, antineoplastic treatment modality with favorable efficacy and safety being demonstrated in the most aggressive type of malignant gliomas, glioblastoma (GBM). In 2 large randomized, controlled phase 3 trials, the addition of TTFields was associated with increased overall survival when combined with adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) chemotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed GBM (ndGBM) and comparable overall survival compared with standard chemotherapy in patients with recurrent GBM (rGBM). TTFields target cancer cells by several mechanisms of action (MoA) including suppression of proliferation, migration and invasion, disruption of DNA repair and angiogenesis, antimitotic effects, and induction of apoptosis and immunogenic cell death. Having several MoAs makes TTFields an attractive modality to combine with standard, salvage, and novel treatment regimens (e.g., radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy). Treatment within the field of malignant gliomas is evolving to emphasize combinatorial approaches that work synergistically to improve patient outcomes. Here, we review the current use of TTFields in GBM, discuss MOA and treatment delivery, and consider the potential for its wider adoption in other gliomas.",

Professionals use different methods to feed infants with PKU and our survey aimed to document practices across Europe. We sent a cross sectional, survey monkey\u00ae questionnaire to European health professionals working in IMD. It contained 31 open and multiple-choice questions. The results were analysed according to different geographical regions. Ninety-five centres from 21 countries responded. Over 60% of centres commenced diet in infants by age 10\u00a0days, with 58% of centres implementing newborn screening by day 3 post birth. At diagnosis, infant hospital admission occurred in 61% of metabolic centres, mainly in Eastern, Western and Southern Europe. Breastfeeding fell sharply following diagnosis with only 30% of women still breast feeding at 6\u202fmonths. 53% of centres gave pre-measured Phe-free infant formula before each breast feed and 23% alternated breast feeds with Phe-free infant formula. With standard infant formula feeds, measured amounts were followed by Phe-free infant formula to satiety in 37% of centres ( n =\u202f35/95), whereas 44% ( n =\u202f42/95) advised mixing both formulas together. Weaning commenced between 17 and 26\u202fweeks in 85% centres, \u226526\u202fweeks in 12% and\u202f<\u202f17\u202fweeks in 3%. This is the largest European survey completed on PKU infant feeding practices. It is evident that practices varied widely across Europe, and the practicalities of infant feeding in PKU received little focus in the PKU European Guidelines (2017). There are few reports comparing different feeding techniques with blood Phe control, Phe fluctuations and growth. Controlled prospective studies are necessary to assess how different infant feeding practices may influence longer term feeding development.",

The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and safety of using moxibustion for treating anorexia and improving quality of life in patients with metastatic cancer. Methods . We conducted a randomized sham-controlled trial of moxibustion. Sixteen patients with metastatic cancer were recruited from Daejeon, South Korea. The patients were randomly placed into a true or a sham moxibustion group and received 10 true or sham moxibustion treatments administered to the abdomen (CV12, CV8, CV4) and legs (ST36) over a 2-week period. Outcome measures included interest in participating in the trial, identification of successful recruitment strategies, the appropriateness of eligibility criteria, and compliance with the treatment plan (ie, attendance at treatment sessions). Clinical outcomes included results of the Functional Assessment of Anorexia/Cachexia Therapy (FAACT), answers on the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 30-item core quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30) questionnaires, scores on the visual analogue scale (VAS), and the results from blood tests and a safety evaluation. Results . Moxibustion was an acceptable intervention in patients with metastatic cancer. Compliance with the treatment protocol was high, with 11 patients completing all 10 treatments. No serious adverse events related to moxibustion occurred, but 4 patients in the true moxibustion group reported mild rubefaction, which disappeared in a few hours. Conclusion . This study suggests that moxibustion may be safely used to treat anorexia and improve quality of life in patients with metastatic cancer. However, further research is needed to confirm this result.",

    "abstract": "The purpose of this study was to examine the associations of childbirth, breastfeeding, and their interaction with breast cancer (BC) risk reduction, and to evaluate the heterogeneity in the BC risk reduction effects of these factors by menopause, hormone receptor (HR) status, and pathological subtype. BC patients aged 40+ from the Korean Breast Cancer Registry in 2004-2012 and controls from the Health Examinee cohort participants were included in this study after 1:1 matching (12 889 pairs) by age and enrollment year. BC risk according to childbirth, breastfeeding, and their interaction was calculated in logistic regression models using odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). BC risk decreased with childbirth (3+ childbirths relative to 1 childbirth: OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.78 and OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.68 to 0.95 in postmenopausal and premenopausal women, respectively); and the degree of risk reduction by the number of children was heterogeneous according to menopausal status ( p -heterogeneity=0.04), HR status ( p -heterogeneity<0.001), and pathological subtype ( p -heterogeneity<0.001); whereas breastfeeding for 1-12 months showed a heterogeneous association with BC risk according to menopausal status, with risk reduction only in premenopausal women ( p -heterogeneity<0.05). The combination of 2 more childbirths and breastfeeding for \u226513 months had a much stronger BC risk reduction of 49% (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.45 to 0.58). This study suggests that the combination of longer breastfeeding and more childbirths reduces BC risk more strongly, and that women who experience both 2 or more childbirths and breastfeed for \u226513 months can reduce their BC risk by about 50%.",

World Health Organization recommends continuation of breastfeeding in these difficult times, with due precautions. If direct breastfeeding is not possible, milk expression should be explored. Pasteurized donor human milk from milk banks may be fed if mother\u2019s own milk is not available. To universalize access to human milk, the Indian government has proposed the establishment of comprehensive lactation management centers/milk banks, lactation management units, and lactation support units at all levels of the public health system. Due to COVID-19, these centers are encountering additional challenges cutting across interventions of rooming in, breastfeeding, milk expression, and provision of donor milk and kangaroo mother care. We discuss issues faced and alleviation measures taken by these centres in relation to provision of an exclusive human milk diet for infants during the pandemic.",

[Subjects and Methods] We report on the clinical trial of the newly developed i2i head & neck positioning & support system called i2i for locomotively disabled children with periventricular leukomalacia (PVL). [Results] Two major advantages of the i2i were observed in the trial. The first was its favorable effect on the alignment of the spine to prevent scoliosis and to provide stable breathing and optimal seating, which resulted in improvement of the children\u2019s activities of daily living (ADL). The second was its direct application of force to the head rather than indirectly to the pelvis in a conventional seat arrangement. The conventional way of head support is based on stabilization of the trunk which is based on stabilization of the pelvis by some seating arrangement. [Conclusion] The trial of the i2i device demonstrated its usefulness in helping PVL children with insufficient head control develop their abilities while preventing secondary disability.",

We report the case of a 68-year-old man with spontaneous esophageal perforation who was successfully treated over 96 h after onset by thoracic drainage and jejunostomy for enteral nutrition. He vomited after drinking alcohol, soon followed by epigastralgia. Heart failure was suspected on admission to another hospital. Spontaneous esophageal perforation was diagnosed 48 h after admission. Chest tube drainage was performed, but his general condition deteriorated and he was transferred to our hospital. Emergent surgery was performed and esophageal perforation combined with pyothorax and mediastinitis was identified on the left side of the lower esophagus. The left thoracic cavity was rinsed and thoracic drainage was performed. Feeding jejunostomy was performed for postoperative enteral nutrition. Effective drainage and sufficient nutrition management appear extremely valuable in treating spontaneous esophageal perforation.",

This study determined the usage patterns, gastrointestinal tolerance, anthropometrics and safety of high\u2010fibre enteral feeding in malnourished children with growth failure. This Turkish observational study between February 2013 and June 2015 comprised 345 paediatric patients from 17 centres with malnutrition\u2010related growth failure, with a weight and height of <2 SD percentiles for their age. Changes in anthropometrics, gastrointestinal symptoms, defecation habits and safety data relating to adverse events were analysed during the six\u2010month follow\u2010up period. Most subjects (99.7%) were supplemented with enteral feeding. The absolute difference and 95% confidence interval values for the Z scores of height for age, weight for age, weight for height and body mass index for height increased significantly in four months to six months to 0.21 (0.09\u20130.32), 0.61 (0.51\u20130.70), 0.81 (0.56\u20131.06) and 0.70 (0.53\u20130.86), respectively (p < 0.001 for each). The percentage of patients with normal defecation frequency significantly increased from 70.3% to 92.8% at the four months to six months visit (p = 0.004). Adverse events occurred in 15 (4.3%) of patients.

    "abstract": "Substantial racial disparities accounted for 66% of non-Hispanic Black mothers initiating breastfeeding in 2015 compared with 83% of non-Hispanic white mothers and 87% of Hispanic mothers in Tennessee. Created in 2015, Breastfeeding Sisters That Are Receiving Support (BSTARS) uses key partnerships at monthly meetings that promote supportive environments with topics around breastfeeding education, support, and women's health issues. The BSTARS group helps rebuild the culture surrounding the health equity of Black women and women of color and their families by offering informational and emotional support, facilitate positive changes, and heal historical trauma. BSTARS addresses barriers to breastfeeding support for Black women and women of color, including lack of support from the mother's partner, family, or health care provider, generational myths, unawareness of public health programs to support breastfeeding, educational gaps, and embarrassment. This program incorporates critical partnerships, including health care providers, birth workers, and other supporters, into the organization to offer comprehensive support for the mother's continuity of care. The environment and educational support for breastfeeding and women's health issues are addressed under the lens of health equity and eliminating barriers experienced by the mother's color, or socioeconomic status. A mother's socioeconomic status often unjustly hinders her from receiving the lactation and social support needed for healthier outcomes. In 2019, the breastfeeding initiation rate in Tennessee increased to 71.3% among non-Hispanic Blacks. BSTARS has reached >500 families since its inception. BSTARS focuses their specific intervention on all facets of the family dyad, through teaching the importance of breastfeeding and breast milk now and sustainable for the future.",

    "abstract": "Sodium and chloride need to be ingested and cannot be stored. Therefore, choice of habitat and diet as related to NaCl needs to be tightly regulated. We thus expect that the behavioral effects of salt are organized according to its concentration. Here, we comparatively \u201cfingerprint\u201d the reflex releasing (in choice and feeding experiments) versus the reinforcing effects of sodium chloride (\u201csalt\u201d) in terms of their concentration dependencies, using larval Drosophila . Qualitatively, we find that the behavioral effects of salt in all 3 assays are similar: choice, feeding, and reinforcing effect all change from appetitive to aversive as concentration is increased. Quantitatively, however, the appetitive effects for choice and feeding share their optimum at around 0.02 M, whereas the dose\u2013response curve for the reinforcing effect is shifted by more than one order of magnitude toward higher concentrations. Interestingly, a similar shift between these 2 kinds of behavioral effect is also found for sugars (Schipanski et al. 2008). Thus, for salt and for sugar, the sensory-to-motor system is more sensitive regarding immediate, reflexive behavior than regarding reinforcement. We speculate that this may partially be due to a dissociation of the sensory pathways signaling toward either reflexive behavior or internal reinforcement.",

Using nationally representative samples of US 8th, 10th, and 12th grade students, and follow-up of subsamples of 12th graders, we present overall and sex-specific prevalence estimates of past 2-week HID from 29\u2009966 individuals at the modal ages of 14 to 30 in 2016-2017. Similar data for the more commonly studied measure of binge drinking (having 5+ drinks in a row) is provided for comparison. HID prevalence ranged from 1% to 11.5% and was significantly higher for males than females at all ages other than modal age 14 (8th grade). Binge drinking prevalence ranged from 3.5% to 32.5%; males reported a higher prevalence than females at approximately half of the ages examined. Peak binge drinking and HID age for males was earlier (modal age 21/22) than that for females (modal age 21-24 for binge drinking and 25/26 for HID). The observed rapid increase in HID from adolescence through the early to mid-20s highlights the importance of prevention and intervention efforts targeted to these ages.",

    "abstract": "Cancer anorexia\u2013cachexia syndrome is characterized by decreased food intake, weight loss, muscle tissue wasting and psychological distress, and this syndrome is a major source of increased morbidity and mortality in cancer patients. This study aimed to clarify the gut\u2013brain peptides involved in the pathogenesis of the syndrome and determine effective treatment for cancer anorexia\u2013cachexia. We show that both ghrelin insufficiency and resistance were observed in tumor-bearing rats. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) decreased the plasma level of acyl ghrelin, and its receptor antagonist, \u03b1-helical CRF, increased food intake of these rats. The serotonin 2c receptor (5-HT2cR) antagonist SB242084 decreased hypothalamic CRF level and improved anorexia, gastrointestinal (GI) dysmotility and body weight loss. The ghrelin receptor antagonist (D-Lys3)-GHRP-6 worsened anorexia and hastened death in tumor-bearing rats. Ghrelin attenuated anorexia\u2013cachexia in the short term, but failed to prolong survival, as did SB242084 administration. In addition, the herbal medicine rikkunshito improved anorexia, GI dysmotility, muscle wasting, and anxiety-related behavior and prolonged survival in animals and patients with cancer. The appetite-stimulating effect of rikkunshito was blocked by (D-Lys3)-GHRP-6. Active components of rikkunshito, hesperidin and atractylodin, potentiated ghrelin secretion and receptor signaling, respectively, and atractylodin prolonged survival in tumor-bearing rats. Our study demonstrates that the integrated mechanism underlying cancer anorexia\u2013cachexia involves lowered ghrelin signaling due to excessive hypothalamic interactions of 5-HT with CRF through the 5-HT2cR. Potentiation of ghrelin receptor signaling may be an attractive treatment for anorexia, muscle wasting and prolong survival in patients with cancer anorexia\u2013cachexia.",

The Chinese government has enacted a range of policies and statutes to control contaminant emissions and improve air quality. On the basis of the national air quality ground observation database, the spatial and temporal distribution of air quality index value (AQI), fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ), coarse particles (PM 10 ), sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), carbon monoxide (CO), and ozone (O 3 ) were explored in 336 cities throughout China from 2014 to 2019. AQI and most pollutants (except O 3 ) decreased in concentrations from 2014 to 2019. In 2019, all cities except Henan reached the level 2 of the ambient air quality index, and six cities had a lower ambient air quality index and reached the level 1. Spatially, higher pollutant concentrations were concentrated in large city clusters, whereas the areas with high O 3 concentration were found across the country. Furthermore, central heating was shown to have a negative impact on air quality. The observed AQI value, PM 2.5 , PM 10 , SO 2 , NO 2 , and CO concentrations were highest in north and northwest China and Henan province in central China. The correlations among pollutants suggest that the main sources of pollutants are fossil fuel combustion, industrial production, and motor vehicle emissions. The influence of meteorological factors on air quality, long-distance transportation, and the transformations of pollutants should be explored in future research.

    "abstract": "Global and national efforts in the 21st century are directed toward the elimination of new pediatric HIV infections through evidence-based infant feeding interventions for the prevention of mother-to-child-transmission, with patient preference, motivation, and adherence identified as key factors for success. This study assessed the challenges faced by HIV-infected parturients in adhering to the national infant feeding recommendations and their infant feeding preference for prevention of mother-to-child transmission in South East Nigeria. This is a cross-sectional, descriptive, questionnaire-based study of 556 parturients infected with HIV/AIDS. The mean age of the participants was 28.0\u00b15.3 years. The infant feeding choices were made jointly by both partners (61.1%) in the antepartum period. The HIV status disclosure rate was 89.2%. A large proportion (91.7%) practiced exclusive breastfeeding with highly active antiretroviral therapy, and 7.6% practiced mixed feeding because of nonadherence to their choice and national/international recommendations on infant feeding in the context of HIV/AIDS. This was mainly a result of pressure from family members (42.8%) and cultural practices (28.5%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicates that adherence was strongly associated with age, marital status, and employment status, but not with residence, educational status, or parity. Exclusive breastfeeding is predominately the infant feeding choice among HIV-infected parturients in South East Nigeria, but there is still a gap between infant feeding preference and adherence to standard practice as a result of sociocultural challenges associated with risk for mixed feeding and the risk for mother-to-child-transmission of HIV by nursing mothers.",
